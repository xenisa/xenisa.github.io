<p>The right of property implies the right to make contracts about that
property: to give it away or to exchange titles of ownership for the
property of another person. Unfortunately, many libertarians, devoted to
the right to make contracts, hold the contract itself to be an absolute,
and therefore maintain that any voluntary contract whatever must be
legally enforceable in the free society.</p>

<h1 id="the-title-transfer-theory-of-contracts">The Title-Transfer
Theory of Contracts</h1>
<p>As stated in the opening quote, property theory lies antecedent to
contract theory—that is, the right to make contracts is implied by the
right to own property, and not the other way around. First, recall that
property rights are conflict-avoiding norms, the owner is said to be the
man who can justly control the resource in question. But these ownership
rights are not set in stone, the owner of a property may abandon it or
transfer title to it to someone else—consider Crusoe leaving his stick
to rot after he has finished spear fishing, if he no longer considers it
to be a good which he is acting with, Friday is capable of possessing it
without there being any conflict. In other words, owning a thing
involves actually possessing it along with the intent to direct the use
of it, if you lose this intent you no longer own it. This is
abandonment, where a property is simply ceded back to nature, ripe for
someone to homestead it—recall that such abandonment must be objective
and intersubjectively ascertainable. The latter case, of a man
transferring title to someone else is the subject of the theory of
contracts. The question of concern is what types of contracts are
enforceable and why.</p>
<p>Allow me to first construct the basic case of Crusoe transferring
ownership of his stick to Friday. For this to be a transfer and not an
abandonment, Crusoe must relinquish control at the same time that Friday
takes up control, and each man must have the goal of the transfer going
forth—that is to say, there exists no time between Crusoe and Fridays
ownership where the stick was unowned. This means that a third man,
Xury, could not come along and quickly swoop in on the property and
thereby homestead it. It is clear that Friday now has title to the
property. In short, a transfer of title to the stick from Crusoe to
Friday involves Crusoe abandoning the stick at the same time that Friday
homesteads it. What makes this transfer an enforceable contract, is that
if Crusoe does not physically go through with giving the stick up he has
implicitly committed theft—the stick belongs to Friday now and Crusoe is
using it against Fridays consent. This is because Crusoes agreement to
the contract is evidence that he wishes to relinquish control–to abandon
the stick–he cannot deny this without contradiction.</p>
<p>It is therefore those contracts where defaulting would imply
aggression that are enforceable. Consider a mere promise, say a woman
agrees to marry her boyfriend but does not go through with it—she has
gone back on her word, but she has not violated the boyfriends rights,
therefore mere promises like this are not enforceable. A promise is only
enforceable to the extent that it implies a transfer of property
titles—in such a case the property may be re-possessed by its
now-owner.</p>
<p>This theory of contract is called the “title-transfer” theory for
this reason—to sum up, only those contracts which define the terms of
the transfer of title to <em>alienable</em> property are legitimate.
Furthermore, <em>conditional</em> transfers are also legitimate, say
that Crusoe agrees to transfer title to the stick to Friday on the
condition that Friday performs a dance. Upon Friday meeting the
condition set forth by Crusoe, title to the stick is transferred to
him—this is because the intention was made clear by both Crusoe and
Friday that Friday is the just director of the use of the stick upon the
condition being met. It will be seen in a later lesson why Crusoe would
be “estopped” from challenging Fridays ownership—that is to say, Crusoe
could not coherently deny that Friday owns the stick upon the condition
being met. What is important is that on this theory a contract is not a
piece of paper, the piece of paper is rather evidence of a contract
existing, the contract can be verbal, agreed to via semaphore, or any
manner of other methods of communication—all that a piece of signed
paper can do is serve as evidence that a given contract was communicated
and agreed upon by the parties in question.</p>
<p>An interesting implication of this theory is that there isn’t really
such a thing as “breaching” or “breaking” a contract. If <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> agree that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> will transfer to <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> a sum of 10 ounces of silver on
the condition that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> performs
magic at <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>’s birthday party,
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has not violated <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>’s rights by not showing up, if
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> wanted to encourage <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to go through with the deal he
simply need bake in a penalty clause stating that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> transfers to <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> a sum of 5 ounces of silver if he
does not perform the magic. Still here, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> does not “breach” the contract by
not showing up, he has simply engaged in an action which the contract
covers. The aggression would only be if doesn’t perform and doesn’t hand
over the 5 ounces, not because this would breach the terms of the
contract, but because this would be a theft of 5 ounces of silver.</p>
<p>Consider further the case of Smith agreeing to pay 50 lbs of gold for
Jones’ car, Smith takes the car but refuses to hand over the 50 lbs of
gold to Jones, has Smith stolen the car or the 50 lbs of gold? Well, if
Smith actually has 50 lbs of gold then title to it was instantly
transferred to Jones upon the contract being accepted, thus it is the
gold that has been stolen. On the other hand if Smith does not have 50
lbs of gold then the condition for the transfer of the car has not been
met, so Jones still owns the car and that is what Smith has stolen.</p>
<h1 id="fraud">Fraud</h1>
<p>Fraud can be defined as theft-by-trick, i.e. it is a theft performed
by deceiving the victim. Consider the example where Crusoe has blunted
the tip of his spear and that’s why he wants to get rid of it, Crusoe
lies to Friday and claims that the spear is as sharp as a razor, this is
fraud—Crusoe has deceived Friday about the nature of the spear. This
means that this was not a valid contract, Crusoe did not have the
intention of transferring title to a sharp spear to Friday and therefore
the contract is null. If Friday had given Crusoe some sea-shells in
exchange, Crusoe has implicitly stolen those shells.</p>
<p>A particularly prevalent example of fraud is found in fractional
reserve
banking;<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
the fractional reserve bank keeps only some fraction of the money
deposited and loans out the rest. Consider a full reserve bank; various
people come and deposit 100 ounces of gold, and the bank therefore gives
these depositors in total certificates for 100 ounces of gold. Here
there is a one-to-one correspondence between titles to the
gold–evidenced by the certificates–and actual gold in the vault.
Consider what would happen if this bank decided to implement an 80%
reserve policy, and they therefore loan out 20 ounces of gold, this
would mean that the bank has stolen that gold, because there was already
a one-to-one correspondence between property titles in the gold held by
depositors and actual gold in the vault—therefore the bank is committing
fraud in deceiving people into the belief that they actually hold title
to that gold. Perhaps instead of physically loaning out the gold they
keep all the gold they have, but they give out 20 ounces worth of
certificates for gold; this would also be fraud because there would be
120 ounces worth of titles to gold, but only 100 ounces of gold—more
property titles than actual property implies that people are being
deceived about the actual nature of the property in existence, which
therefore means there must be fraud.</p>
<p>Often, so-called “free-banking” supporters will hold that the right
of people to make whatever contracts they expect to be advantageous
means that such fractional reserve banks are not criminal institutions,
but as we have seen these people are misunderstanding the nature of
property and contracts. It is not the case that one is able to make
whatever contract they want so long as everyone agrees to it, property
theory lies antecedent to contract theory, therefore a contract which
misrepresents the actual nature of property in existence is invalid.
This is not to say that a fractional-reserve casino game is fraudulent,
but representing this casino game as a bank is. A bank is a
money-warehouse, not a casino game. Such a casino game would not involve
people depositing <em>their</em> money in <em>their</em> account and
retaining title as evidenced by money substitutes, such a game would
involve people transferring their money <em>to the casino</em> in order
for the casino to engage in some gambling algorithm with it. So
fractional reserve <em>banking</em> is fraud, fractional reserve
roulette is not—the definition of fraud in terms of deception is another
concept that highlights the importance of communication to libertarian
theory. Just as me loaning my friend 5 ounces of silver is not me
depositing my money in an account held by my friend, it is me
transferring that silver to him, so too is me placing a bet with a
casino not me depositing money in an account, it is me transferring that
bet to them.</p>
<h1 id="debtors-prison">Debtors Prison</h1>
<p>This concept of a loan is relevant to the question of debtors prison.
The question is twofold; first if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> loans <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> 1000 ounces of silver in exchange
for 1050 ounces in one years time but <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> defaults has he stolen from <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, and second would <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> be permitted to put <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> to work in a debtors prison to pay
off this stolen sum? For the former question, if it is the case that
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has stolen from <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, <em>what</em> has he stolen—the
1000 ounces or the 1050 ounces? He surely hasn’t stolen the 1000 ounces
because that money was transferred to him at the time of the contract
such that he could invest it in his various projects, if it was not
transferred there would be no loan in the first place. It also cannot be
the case that it wasn’t theft at the time but it is retroactively at the
time when he defaults—a property theory must assign a definite owner to
any scarce resource at all times, if retroactive theft is such a thing
in your property theory there exists Schrödinger’s property who’s owner
cannot be determined right here and now such that conflicts over its use
may be avoided. Schrödinger’s property must therefore be expelled from
our rational theory and as such the notion of retroactive theft must
also. The question here is who owns the 1000 ounces immediately after
the contract is accepted, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>? If <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> then <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has no right to invest these funds
and there is no contract to speak of. If <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> then it cannot be that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has stolen the 1000 ounces because
he had title to it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it also can’t be said that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has stolen the 1050 ounces, for if
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has defaulted that means he
does not possess 1050 ounces of silver so how could he possibly have
stolen it if it doesn’t exist? Of course, if <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> actually does possess said sum and
simply refuses to hand it over, this is not strictly speaking a default
on the loan, it is rather <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>
stealing that sum of money. These future-oriented contracts are called
aleatory contracts, they have an implied clause of “unless its
impossible,” this is because the future is uncertain—just as you cannot
contract to transfer title to a square circle, you cannot contract to
transfer money that doesn’t exist, so in such loan arrangements there
must be an implicit condition that the funds actually exist on the due
date. After all, what if <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> was
vapourised in a nuclear explosion along with the funds one week after
the contract was accepted. Upon the money coming due has the now-dead
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> robbed <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> from beyond the grave? What if
everyone except <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> died in the
explosion—if nobody else exists it is nonsensical to speak of anyone
being criminal towards <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>.</p>
<p>In short its not theft unless something was stolen, and its not fraud
unless there was deception—there is no deception in the case of an
aleatory contract on the part of <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> as he is not deceiving <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> into thinking that he has what he
does not. Everyone knows that the future is uncertain, <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has made no claims to the
contrary.</p>
<p>Whilst it is not relevant to legal theory as such how <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> can successfully get around this
hurdle I think it is important to give some notion as to how
future-oriented contracts are still possible and reasonable. First,
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> need only bake in some
interest clause, perhaps each month that passes <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> owes <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> a further 1% on top of the initial
1050 ounces such that when <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>
acquires the requisite sum of money title to it is immediately
transferred to <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. Furthermore,
it is not the job of law to make sure that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> makes a profit on the loan, some
loans go bad, it is an entrepreneurial activity and as such it is per se
uncertain. The fact that the loan goes bad and <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> doesn’t make a return is not
sufficient grounds to justify <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> locking <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> up in a prison and working him as
a slave.</p>
<h1 id="voluntary-slavery">Voluntary Slavery</h1>
<p>With our solid understanding of contract theory, we can analyse the
debate surrounding “voluntary slavery” and determine the correct answer.
The debate essentially centres around whether a mans self-ownership is
alienable or not, that is to say, the question is whether it is
legitimate to transfer ownership of oneself to another person. the
former view is most notably held by Walter Block, and it can be summed
up as
follows:<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The underlying point of the libertarian critique is that if I own
something, I can sell it (and should be allowed by law to do so). If I
can’t sell it, then, and to that extent, I really don’t own it. Take my
own liberty as perhaps the paradigm case of the debate over
inalienability. The claim is that if I really own my liberty, then I
should be free to dispose of it as I please, even if, by so doing, I end
up no longer owning it. Clearly, since I cannot own a square circle, I
cannot sell it. If I can own my own ability to give true love, then I
can sell it; if I logically cannot own this attribute, then, of course,
I cannot give, barter, or sell it to anyone else.</p>
<p>My thesis: No law should be enacted prohibiting or even limiting in
any way people’s rights to alienate those things they own. This is “full
monte” alienability, or commodification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for a voluntary slavery contract to be legitimate, (1) you must
own yourself in the first place and (2) you must be able to sell
yourself. Walters contention with other libertarians is that there does
not exist objects which are ownable but not sellable—the standard
example of a contract pertaining to the sale of a square circle is
illegitimate because you can’t own a square circle in the first place.
This would imply that because people own themselves in the first place,
they can therefore sell themselves.</p>
<p>A prominent counter-argument to this thesis was forwarded by Rothbard
in his <em>Ethics of
Liberty</em>:<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The distinction between a man’s alienable labor service and his
inalienable will may be further explained; a man can alienate his labor
service, but he cannot sell the capitalized future value of that
service. In short, he cannot, in nature, sell himself into slavery and
have this sale enforced—for this would mean that his future will over
his own person was being surrendered in advance. In short, a man can
naturally expend his labor currently for someone else’s benefit, but he
cannot transfer himself, even if he wished, into another man’s permanent
capital good. For he cannot rid himself of his own will, which may
change in future years and repudiate the current arrangement. The
concept of “voluntary slavery” is indeed a contradictory one, for so
long as a laborer remains totally subservient to his master’s will
voluntarily, he is not yet a slave since his submission is voluntary;
whereas, if he later changed his mind and the master enforced his
slavery by violence, the slavery would not then be voluntary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several ways a Blockean might respond to this attack, first
they could point to the frontal lobotomy as a procedure which makes a
person akin to an animal in terms of thinking. Perhaps there could be a
pill or machine invented in the future which would nullify only those
parts of a mans brain which are responsible for his conceptual
abilities—surely a man who underwent a procedure such as these would
have indeed–potentially permanently–subdued his will such that he may be
more effectively directed by his enslaver. This would mean that
voluntary slavery is not per se illegitimate, but rather is only
illegitimate where men cannot figure out how to subdue the slaves will.
Furthermore, it is not the will which is relevant to a voluntary slavery
contract but the body, so even if it is logically impossible to transfer
the will of person <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to person
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, it may <em>not</em> be the
case that its impossible to transfer the body from <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. After all, both the supporters
and rejectors of the right to make slave contracts agree that it is
possible to have someone as your slave—that is to say its possible for
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> to possess <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, the question is whether it’s
possible for this to be a <em>just</em> possession.</p>
<p>And on this note, let us recall the nature of a mans self-ownership.
A body is necessarily and objectively linked to an acting man, and it is
this link which imbues a man with ownership. Any time you argue with
anyone you must assume the primacy of this link and its validity in
making the other person own their body. It is the argument from
argument, then, which demonstrates the inalienability of the self. That
is to say, ownership is just control, which means <em>argumentatively
justifiable</em> control, and the very nature of argumentatively
justifying anything implies a mutual recognition of self-ownership,
therefore a master cannot justly possess his slave making voluntary
slavery a contradiction in terms. Block rejects this notion of an
objective-link establishing ownership, stating the
following:<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us posit you have a dog who is heart and soul with you. K9 dogs
are said to have this sort of connection with their masters. According
to Kinsella, not only would it be illegal to sell this dog […] but,
also, well-nigh logically impossible for this to occur. Just as we all
“have the best link to my body”, you, too, have the best link to this
dog. You snap your fingers, and the dog does your bidding, not that of
the neighbor, to whom you have sold the dog. The point is, “the best
link to, in terms of control,” is clearly way outside the bounds of
libertarian homesteading and property rights theory. Merely because
someone has “the best link” to something, does not mean he is
necessarily the legitimate owner of it […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the dog is clearly disanalogous to the human case—a dog is an
external object, not a (human) body. What we have in the case of a dog
that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> wants to sell to <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is a case of either <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> “coercing” the dog to do their
bidding. The dog is analogous to a machine-gun that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> may well be more adept at
using—the point is not over who is more scientifically capable of using
the object for some end though. If the dog was capable of acting and
arguing then indeed it would be a contradiction to assert that either
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> could own the dog, as they would
have to recognise the dogs self-ownership. This is because the dog would
then have an objective and undeniable link to his own dog-body. The dog
has no such link in reality because he cannot act or argue—the dog is in
the same legal category as a machine-gun. It may well be the case that
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is more capable of using the
dog for certain ends, but this is not enough to demonstrate a link as
strong as is between an actor-arguer and his own body.</p>
<p>Moreover, a first-principles understanding of contract highlights the
fact that for <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to transfer
title of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> must relinquish
control–i.e. abandon <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>–at the
same time that <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> takes up
control. You cannot abandon your body without making yourself braindead,
so you cannot–whilst remaining an actor–transfer title to your body.
After all, such abandonment of the property would have to be objective
and intersubjectively ascertainable, merely decreeing that you no longer
own yourself is not enough. What this means is that voluntary slavery is
an impossibility, insofar as you do make yourself braindead and thus
non-existent in the praxeologic sense you cannot be said to consent or
not consent to anything. It is not proper to say that the stick I
appropriate from nature is consenting or not consenting to be my
slave—it is a stick, not a moral being capable of consent. Therefore,
the closest one can get to voluntary slavery is to render the so-called
“slave” incapable of action or argumentation, to completely destroy
their will in Rothbardian terms, and thus make this person legally
analogous to a corpse.</p>
<p>Rothbard therefore already had the shape of this idea in his mind,
but spoke of it using the confusing terminology of will-transfer, as
Block says, “will
schmill!”<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
Whether you can literally transfer or suppress the will of an acting
being isn’t relevant, what is relevant however, and what Rothbard was on
the cusp of, is that consent does matter. Merely promising in the
present that you will do whatever your master says, that you will be
their slave, does not mean that they own you—mere promises do not
establish this, you can always change your mind in future and revoke
consent. Consider the case of your girlfriend agreeing to have sex with
you tomorrow after dinner, the time comes and you are getting ready to
do the deed but she changes her mind and tells you that she no longer
wants to go forward with the arrangement. But is she not my slave for
the purposes of this contract? She agreed before that she would obey my
wishes on this matter, so am I permitted to have sex with her or would
this be rape? Clearly the latter is true—just because she gave consent
before does not imply that she cannot revoke said consent. The same is
true for all voluntary slavery, merely agreeing now to always obey the
masters wishes does not transfer ownership of anything. The Rothbardian
analysis is also absolutely correct in that demolition of the will would
allow a body to be owned by another, but only because this demolition of
will would render the individual analogous to a corpse.</p>
<p>It is therefore not all that surprising that one cannot sell their
body (whilst remaining alive), after all as discussed earlier, the two
methods of alienation are title-transfer and abandonment, we already
accept that its not possible for an actor to abandon their body, what
the above analysis shows is that it’s also not possible to alienate your
body through title-transfer either. Moreover, as discussed above, for
title-transfer to be possible in the first place you have to be able to
abandon the thing in question. If <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> wants to transfer title of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, what <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> must do is abandon title to <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> at the same time that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> takes up title to <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, this first step of abandonment
cannot occur in bodies, and therefore ownership of bodies cannot be
transferred. The only exception is when the person in question dies or
is rendered braindead, at this point their body is indeed abandoned to
nature and as such the only valid way to transfer title to your own body
is by doing so in a last will and testament.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to see property in external objects as being
equivalent to property in bodies and then using the fact that you can
trade external objects to claim that you can also trade bodies—ownership
is the right to control a scarce resource, it takes an additional step
to say that you can give up that right or that other people could take
it. The confusion on this matter is derived from a conflation between
two different senses of the word “ownership.” In this course great
attention has been paid to the legal sense of this word, but there is
also such a thing as catallactic ownership, which is the sense used by
economists. This is why an economist may say something like, “<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> sells his labour services for 5
ounces of gold to <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>,” to the
legal theorist such a sentence is incoherent, the labour isn’t owned by
anyone and thus it isn’t being traded—it doesn’t make sense to say that
someone owns their labour, labour is something that you do with things
that you own. After all, what would it mean to exclude someone from your
labour? Thus in the legal sense this is clearly ludicrous, but the
economist does not mean the same thing, what the economist means by
ownership is more akin to possession, or control, as the economist is
not concerned with whether said control or possession is just. <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> certainly does control his labour,
at least in the economic sense, he can choose to employ his labour for
whatever line of production he sees fit, and in the economic sense it
makes sense to speak of him trading this labour with other people, but
one should not then bring such an analysis into legal matters, such
would be a dreadful mistake. The voluntary slavery contract is the
paramount example of this mistake, Blocks argument hinges on the notion
that if you own something you can sell it and vice versa. But it is
simply not the case that ownership implies selling or that selling
implies ownership. I can sell a bitcoin, or an idea, or my labour, and
yet I do not <em>own</em> any of these things in the legal sense.
Similarly owning something does not imply the right to sell it, as has
been seen with the case of ones body.</p>
<h1 id="the-last-will-and-testament-as-a-contract">The Last Will and
Testament as a Contract</h1>
<p>It is possible to alienate some parts or even all of your body
though—consider Crusoe chopping off his arm. Upon chopping the arm off
it is alienable, Crusoe is able to abandon or trade it at will, because
he is no longer objectively and undeniably linked to his arm. A similar
case exists with respect to ones entire body in the case of death. If
Crusoe sets to paper that upon the condition that he dies, ownership of
his body is transferred to Friday, then this is a legitimate contract.
The instant the condition is met Crusoes body becomes alienable just as
surely as a stick or a sea-shell. There could be no remaining objective
link between Crusoe and his body at this point because Crusoe has
perished—he no longer possesses the potential to engage in any form of
argumentation, and as such third parties are not in contradiction by
claiming to own him. This highlights why a last will and testament is a
legitimate contract in general—simply set the condition for whatever
title-transfers the will defines to be the death of the owner. Should a
man die who has no inheritors his property–including his body–becomes
instantly ceded to nature, ready for someone to homestead it. Therefore
if a man wishes his corpse be treated in a certain way he must transfer
title to it to trusted family or a funeral home.</p>
