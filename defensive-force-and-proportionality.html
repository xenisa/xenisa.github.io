<blockquote>
<p>No doubt punishment serves many purposes. It can deter crime and
prevent the offender from committing further crimes. Punishment can even
rehabilitate some criminals, if it is not capital. It can satisfy a
victim’s longing for revenge, or his relatives’ desire to avenge.
Punishment can also be used as a lever to gain restitution, recompense
for some of the damage caused by the crime. For these reasons, the issue
of punishment is, and always has been, of vital concern to civilized
people. They want to know the effects of punishment and effective ways
of carrying it out.</p>

<h1 id="the-just-means-of-punishment">The Just Means of Punishment</h1>
<h2 id="the-theory-of-dialogical-estoppel">The Theory of Dialogical
Estoppel</h2>
<p>Thusfar this course has elucidated theories and examples denoting
what is and is not aggression. Now that we know what it means to be
criminal, this lesson will answer the question of what actions are just
in defending against and punishing aggressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[First,] [w]hat does it mean to punish? Dictionary definitions are
easy to come by, but in the sense that interests those of us who want to
punish, punishment is the infliction of physical force on a person, in
response to something that he has done or has failed to do. Punishment
thus comprises physical violence committed against a person’s body, or
against any other property that a person legitimately owns, against any
rights that a person has. Punishment is for, or in response to, some
action, inaction, feature, or status of the person punished; otherwise,
it is simply random violence, which is not usually considered to be
punishment. Thus when we punish a person, it is because we consider him
to be a wrongdoer of some sort. We typically want to teach him or others
a lesson, or exact vengeance or restitution, for what he has
done.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the question of justifying a punishment only arises insofar
as the wrongdoer rejects the justice of the punishment. That is to say,
if the criminal consents to a certain retaliation, this retaliation is
per se just as there can be no conflicts where the wills of men are in
harmony. Justifying a punishment is far more challenging when the
criminal does not consent, i.e. when the criminal wishes to challenge
the justice of a given punishment. We know from prior analysis that this
challenge seeks to test the justification against the nature of
argumentatively justifying as such. If the punishment cannot be
justified without thereby falling into contradiction, it is unjust.</p>
<p>Therefore, the nature of argumentation is a suitable starting point
to obtain a rational theory of punishment. Recall that contradictions
are falsehoods, and thus not a feature of a correct argument, therefore
a person can be prevented from making certain claims in a dialectic if
those claims are inconsistent with his actions. To be abundantly clear,
to avoid any confusion; the person is not being prevented from making
these claims by a judge or a cop or whatever physically coercing him
into not making the claims, he is prevented from making the claims by
the very nature of dialectic as such—in other words, if he did make
those knowingly incoherent claims he would not be engaged in
argumentation, he would rather be babbling or telling a joke or
something else. This forms the root of what Kinsella dubs “Dialogical
Estoppel.”<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
Lord Coke explains that the word “estoppel” is used “because a man’s own
act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his
mouth,”<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>
and “dialogical” refers to dialogue, aka argumentation. So we can say
that a man is, by the nature of argumentation as such, estopped from
making certain inconsistent or contradictory
claims:<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To say that a person is estopped from making certain claims means
that the claims cannot even possibly be right, because they are
contradictory. It is to recognize that his assertion is simply wrong
because it is contradictory.</p>
<p>Applying estoppel in such a manner perfectly complements the very
purpose of dialogue. Dialogue […] is by its nature an activity aimed at
finding truth. Anyone engaged in argument is necessarily endeavoring to
discern the truth about some particular subject; to the extent this is
not the case, there is no dialogue occurring, but mere babbling or even
physical fighting. Nor can this be denied. Anyone engaging in argument
long enough to deny that truth is the goal of discourse contradicts
himself, because he is himself asserting or challenging the truth of a
given proposition. Thus, the assertion as true of anything that simply
cannot be true is incompatible with the very purpose of discourse.
Anything that cannot be true is contrary to the truth-finding purpose of
discourse, and thus is not permissible within the bounds of the
discourse.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="applying-estoppel">Applying Estoppel</h2>
<p>Let’s apply this theory of estoppel to the case of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> punching <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. Assume that this is the extent of
the assault, as the question of defending an ongoing aggression shall be
discussed in the next section, <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> decides that he wants to punish
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> in an eye-for-an-eye manner
by punching him back, or perhaps by hiring a champion, <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, to punch <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> if <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> cannot, or does not want to, do
this himself. If <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> were to
challenge this punishment, he would claim that this punching of him is
an impermissible action, i.e. that people should be prohibited from
punching him. But, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has
previously demonstrated that he thinks that he should not be prohibited
from punching <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. In essence,
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has pre-supposed that
punching people sans-consent is just, and is now explicitly making the
claim that its unjust. This is a clearly incoherent position, thus <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is estopped from challenging his
punishment, therefore we revert back to the simple case of an
unchallenged punishment which is per se just.</p>
<p>Notice that this applies only to punching as the punishment; <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> could coherently argue that it is
unjust to murder him, or take a lock of his hair, or tear up his prized
roses, as these retaliations would be of an entirely different sort.
That is, by merely punching <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>,
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> pre-supposes only that
punching is proper conduct, but he does not per se pre-suppose that any
other invasions of property borders are proper. This is where the
concept of proportionality comes in—the retribution against an aggressor
must come in the same form as the aggression, or else the punishment is
further aggression and thus not just. In short, just retribution is an
eye for an eye, not an eye for a tooth.</p>
<h2 id="potential-objections-from-the-criminal">Potential Objections
from the Criminal</h2>
<h3 id="the-objection-from-particularisation">The Objection from
Particularisation</h3>
<p>There are a number of potential objections to this theory that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> might forward. First, he might
claim that his positions are not that punching is proper and that
punching is improper; but rather that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> punching <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is proper and anyone punching
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is improper. Thus there is
no contradiction and he is not estopped from challenging his punishment.
The issue here is that any norm must in principle be universilisable if
it is to be proposed in an argument, as Hoppe points
out:<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quite commonly it has been observed that argumentation implies that a
proposition claims universal acceptability, or, should it be a norm
proposal, that it is “universalizable.” Applied to norm proposals, this
is the idea, as formulated in the Golden Rule of ethics or in the
Kantian Categorical Imperative, that only those norms can be justified
that can be formulated as general principles which are valid for
everyone without exception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because if one is to claim any proposition as being
argumentatively valid, said proposition must be rational—what this means
is that it must in principle be valid no matter who it is proposed to.
To reject this would be to adopt a polylogism; i.e. that a proposition
might be true when levied in one argument, but not when levied in
another<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>—and
it was shown in the first lesson, that polylogism implies contradiction,
making it false. So universilisability is therefore a pre-supposition of
the very normative discourse that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> would be partaking in by
attempting to reject his punishment, but the norm that its fine for
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to punch <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> but not for others to punch <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is not universalisable—we would be
faced with a contradiction if we tried to swap out <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> for <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> and hold both norms
simultaneously, meaning this norm cannot be applied to
everyone:<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An arguer cannot escape the application of estoppel by arbitrarily
specializing his otherwise-inconsistent views with liberally-sprinkled
“for me only’s.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kinsella points out further that even if we throw away the
requirement of universilisability, and instead assume that norms can be
particularised in this way, this would mean that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> could simply particularise his
punishment norm and thus claim it to be just for him to retaliate—we
would quickly regress into incoherent subjectivist ramblings of might
making right.</p>
<h3 id="the-objection-from-changing-ones-mind">The Objection from
Changing One’s Mind</h3>
<p>So this objection by particularisation fails, leaving our aggressor
estopped once-more; a second potential counter he might raise, however,
is that he has changed his mind—i.e. that he used to think it proper to
punch people, but he has had a change of heart and now realises that
such conduct is evil, and therefore he is not currently in
contradiction, and thus not estopped from objecting to his
punishment.</p>
<p>There are a number of problems with <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s approach here, first, if
changing one’s mind means that one is no longer liable for their prior
actions, then all <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> must do is
punish <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> then afterwards claim
that he has changed his mind about that punishment, meaning he is also
not responsible. You will notice that this would quickly devolve into a
might-plus-regret-makes-right, which would be an irrational ethic.</p>
<p>Second, by <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> changing his
mind, he is per se denouncing his prior aggression, thus asserting that
aggressions are indeed impermissible. This would mean that he could not
coherently deny the right of the victim of aggression to punish said
aggression—to say that an action is permissible is to say that one may
not legally punish it.</p>
<p>Third, this mind-changing is still a form of particularisation—it’s
the claim that the logical structure of what it means to pre-suppose an
action as legitimate can change by the mere fact that the person
pre-supposing said legitimacy also thinks that the action is
illegitimate. Let’s unpack this—what <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is asserting here is that they
believe in their heart that the punching is illegitimate, whether they
only started holding this fact after doing the punching isn’t
particularly relevant. All that matters is at the moment of the assault
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> must pre-suppose that
punching is a legitimate action—this could take place simultaneously
with <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> believing it to be
illegitimate or not, men are capable of believing in contradictory
things after all. What is important is that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> <em>cannot</em> drop the
pre-supposition that punching is legitimate. He has already committed
the act of aggression that pre-supposes this as a legitimate
interaction. Because he cannot drop this pre-supposition, in order to
resolve the contradiction he is left with only the option of dropping
his challenge to the aggression. Therefore he is estopped by
definition.</p>
<p>I will re-iterate this point for clarity; what makes a man estopped
from challenging a given punishment is that the given challenge would
imply a contradiction, meaning it cannot be uttered in an argument. When
I perform some action <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>, I
thereby pre-suppose by this performance that I think I should do <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> as opposed to <span
class="math inline">¬<em>X</em></span>. There is some confusion over
this thesis, often I have encountered the counterargument of the man who
is smoking and says that he should stop—does this man not believe that
he should stop? Is he lying when he says he should stop? That is not
necessarily the case. We can indeed imagine a man who is currently
engaged in an act of smoking–a man who has chosen to smoke rather than
not smoke–who nonetheless believes that he should not smoke. But, this
does <em>not</em> establish that he is not also pre-supposing that he
should smoke. It is possible for a person two hold two contradictory
beliefs at the same time, we call this cognitive dissonance. Consider
the anarchist who goes through the labour of demonstrating that taxation
is theft and that theft is bad, therefore taxation is bad only to be
confronted by his statist opponent who agrees that taxation is theft and
that its bad but still asserts that taxation is a good thing that should
continue. It is clear to anyone who has encountered stupid people that
man is fully capable of holding contradictory theses at the same time.
The upshot of this for our smoker is that by choosing to smoke rather
than not smoke it must be the case that he believes that he should smoke
rather than not smoke, <em>but</em> this does not preclude the
possibility that our smoker <em>also</em> believes that he should not
smoke—it’s just that his belief that he should smoke is in some sense
over-powering his contradictory belief.</p>
<p>There is a further confusion to be addressed at this point which
stems from a conflation between two different senses of the word
“ought.” To highlight this, consider the statement “it is raining
outside, therefore you ought bring an umbrella.” Now, there are two ways
one could interpret this statement; either (1) ought is being used in
its precise logical meaning, or (2) its being used as prudential advice.
For (1) it simply does not follow that because it is raining you ought
bring an umbrella, at least not without additional steps. For (2)
“ought” is being used colloquially, if we were to precisely formulate
(2) it would be something like “it is raining outside so if you do not
wish to get wet when you go outside a potential means to achieve this
goal would be to bring an umbrella.” When formulated precisely it
becomes clear that when prudential advice is given like this, the
statement is really an “is” statement rather than an “ought” statement.
This insight will become crucial in the next lesson so I will not stress
it too heavily here, but the key takeaway for now is that there is only
ought; ought is ought. There doesn’t exist different “flavours” of ought
in logic, it is a failure of imprecision to mix in colloquial usages of
this word.</p>
<p>Bringing this back to our criminal, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, who wishes to challenge his
punishment for punching <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, he
has already demonstrated by his conduct that he thinks punching is a
legitimate interaction. If he then states that it is <em>not</em> a
legitimate interaction, which is required for him to challenge his
punishment, he is in a contradiction. To resolve a contradiction between
two statements, one of the statements <em>has</em> to be dropped,
because <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> simply
<em>cannot</em> drop the statement that punching is proper, he is left
only with being able to drop the statement that punching is improper,
but the statement that punching is improper is the one that is
<em>required</em> for him to challenge the punishment. Therefore, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> <em>cannot</em> challenge his
punishment—he is dialogically estopped from doing so.</p>
<h2 id="mens-rea-vs-actus-reus">Mens Rea vs Actus Reus</h2>
<p>An important note must be made with respect to the application of
this theory of dialogical estoppel—a keen eye will notice that men are
only estopped insofar as they <em>chose</em> to commit the aggression,
that is, a man is only estopped when he purposefully engaged in the
trespass in question. If a man did not purposefully aggress, but rather
accidentally aggressed we say that he lacks “mens rea.” Mens rea is a
legal term meaning “guilty mind,” it is characteristic of the man who
decides that he wants to aggressively stab his neighbor to death, but
not of the man who is hiking and accidentally wanders onto a farmers
field. Mens rea is contrasted with actus reus, meaning “guilty act.”
Actus reus is present in every man who trespasses, whether they did so
knowingly or not. Restitution can be justified on the grounds of actus
reus, retribution requires mens rea. Here, restitution refers to the act
of making the victim whole again, say I steal 5 ounces of silver from my
neighbor, restitution would involve me giving my neighbor 5 ounces of
silver, retribution would involve a further 5 ounces of silver. In
total, assuming I knowingly stole, my neighbor would be due 10 ounces of
silver, 5 in restitution and 5 in retribution.</p>
<p>As a point of clarification, mens rea does not require that the
person in question actually understands that their action was criminal,
all that is required is that they knowingly performed the invasion. For
instance, the nazi prison guard who shoots an escaping Jew has knowingly
invaded that Jews body with his bullet, however that guard may well
believe that his action was justifiable because he believed in German
law, rather than natural law. But, his belief that the action was just
does not absolve him, as he knowingly performed what is objectively an
invasion.</p>
<h1 id="the-just-means-of-defense">The Just Means of Defense</h1>
<h2 id="defense-as-exclusion">Defense as Exclusion</h2>
<p>With an objective theory of the just means of punishment elucidated,
we shall move onto an analysis of what means of <em>defense</em> are
just. Recall that a property right in <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> held by a person <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> implies the right of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to exclude other people from the
use of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. It is from this
recognition that defense is justified—namely, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is permitted to use whatever means
are required to go about excluding people from <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. This simple principle is,
however, not so simple to actually apply to complex scenarios. First
consider the case of a man trespassing onto your front lawn to take a
look at your roses. It is clear that insofar as you do not wish for him
to do this there is trespass occurring—that is, he cannot use your lawn
to stand on at the same time that you wish for him to not stand on your
lawn. Therefore, you may exclude the man from doing so, but could you do
so through arbitrary means? For instance, would you be permitted to fire
a rocket at his feet thereby blowing him up, or would you have to take
“gentler” means first? Let’s consider the relevant rights; the man owns
his body and therefore has a right to exclude you from his body, but you
own your lawn, and thus can exclude him from using your lawn—therefore
you are permitted to possess him to the extent that is required to
remove him from your lawn and no more.</p>
<p>For instance, perhaps the man did not realise it was your property,
but rather a natural feature that is not owned by anyone. Here, the man
would lack mens rea, and perhaps simply informing him that he is
trespassing will suffice to remove him from your lawn. Here, no
possession of his body would be required, and thus no possession could
be justified. However, the man might be stubborn and wish to look at
your roses still, this more stubborn man may require that you grab him
by the arm and walk him off of your property. Here, because the grabbing
of the arm was required to remove him, it can be justified. You could
not grab his arm and begin stabbing at him with a needle, because the
stabbing with a needle does not serve the purpose of excluding the man
from your property and is not required for this exclusion. Therefore
this stabbing would be an additional aggressive invasion of the man,
rather than of your lawn. Here it becomes clear that you would not be
permitted to launch a rocket at the man unless said launching of the
rocket was required to successfully exclude him.</p>
<p>A further example to elaborate upon this principle is your neighbor
kicking his ball onto your lawn. Let’s imagine first that your neighbor
doesn’t want anyone else to touch his ball and you do not wish for the
ball to be on your lawn. Here, the ball is invading your property so you
could justly remove the ball at will—i.e. you are allowed to exclude the
ball from your property and touching the ball is required to remove it.
Imagine an alternative scenario where the ball is on your property and
to teach him a lesson you tell your neighbor that you will not let him
retrieve the ball himself <em>and</em> you will not remove the ball from
your property on your own. This would be a case of excluding the
neighbor from his ball which you are not trying to exclude from your
property. Because you aren’t trying to exclude the ball from your
property it could not be said that the ball has invaded your property,
the neighbor still owns the ball and therefore you are engaged in an act
of forestalling—you are excluding your neighbor from the ball that you
do not own.</p>
<p>However, if you did attempt to exclude the ball from your property,
perhaps by erecting a fence, and your neighbor was nonetheless able to
overcome your exclusion the ball is invading your property. Perhaps this
fence completely encloses your property such that for the neighbor to
retrieve his ball the fence would have to be removed. Certainly you
would be permitted here to continue to exclude your neighbor from
stepping on to retrieve his ball, as his stepping onto your property
would involve a further invasion because you are already excluding
people from your property prior to the ball being kicked on. Here the
principle is that antecedent rights must prevail. You were excluding
people and balls from your lawn which is why you own your wall, you
cannot be compelled to allow further invasions to recover the costs of
prior invasions. Your neighbor must suck it up and hope that you decide
to return his ball to him. This is because your rights in the lawn are
antecedent to your neighbors rights in the ball, as the ball was used to
initiate the conflict. You are rightly allowed to take possession of his
invading ball—Dominiaks contradiction from donut
homesteads<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
is resolved here by your possession of that ball being just, you gain
ownership of that ball by virtue of it being invasive. This is not
“full-monte” ownership, however, like in the case of owning a stick
where you can trade it or use it however you wish. This ownership of the
ball would be specifically for the purpose of excluding invaders from
retrieving the ball, if you removed the ball from your property it would
revert back into the ownership of your neighbor. This analysis applies
also to the cases where a bird drops the ball onto your property or
where a third party kicks the ball, but not where you kick your
neighbors ball onto your property, as <em>you</em> initiated the
conflict there.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-body-sword-and-the-human-body-shield">The Human-Body
Sword and the Human-Body Shield</h2>
<p>The insight that even where your neighbor was not the one responsible
for the invasion of the ball you may still take possession of it is key
for understanding the libertarian answer to the human-body shield.
Consider the case where a criminal steals your neighbors sword and
attempts to stab you with it, and the only way to prevent this from
happening is by damaging the sword, because damaging the sword is
required in excluding the invasion it is just, even if your neighbor
does not want the sword to be damaged. Similarly, if the criminal
instead picks your neighbor up and tries to use him as a sword you would
be justified in damaging your neighbors body insofar as this is required
to exclude the criminals invasions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The situation is superficially different if, instead of attacking you
with stolen property, the criminal instead shields himself with stolen
property. For example, say the criminal wraps himself in your neighbor’s
quilt, approaches you and then begins shooting at you. As you take cover
and draw your sidearm, your neighbor yells, “Don’t shoot my quilt!” As a
libertarian, must you respect the preference of your neighbor? Will
stolen cars and tuxedos become the bane of libertarian police
forces?<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such a scenario you would be justified in taking whatever actions
are required to exclude the criminals attempted invasion as always. It
is required that you shoot back in order to thwart him, thus this is
just, even though it would imply damaging your neighbors quilt.
Moreover, your neighbor would not be justified in attacking you to
defend his quilt—you are doing no wrong by shooting through the quilt,
therefore your neighbor cannot justify attacking you as he is not
responding to an aggression on your part. We can then trivially move
from a criminal using a quilt-shield, to one using your neighbor as a
shield—again, you are justified in shooting back at the criminal, even
if this implies shooting through your neighbor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An equivalent situation would be if the attacking criminal had
connected a device to your neighbor that would kill him if the criminal
were to die. If you defend yourself against the criminal, then your
neighbor will suffer. Yet, as in the previous case, your rights are
antecedent to those of your neighbor. The aggressor brought his property
into conflict. The violation of your neighbor’s property rights occurs
when the criminal connects the device to him, and when the criminal
attacks you, not when you kill the criminal. Furthermore, your neighbor
would not be justified in attacking you to try and prevent you from
killing the
criminal.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is distinct from the situation where your neighbor is a
bystander to the aggression, in such a situation attacking him is not
required to exclude the aggressive invasions from the criminal, so
randomly turning around and shooting at him during the gunfight would be
additional aggression insofar as this is not required to thwart the bad
guy. The same is true if you were given an ultimatum by the criminal
where he will shoot you if you don’t kill your neighbor. You are allowed
only to engage in exclusionary actions <em>against the aggressor</em>,
not against bystanders. These exclusionary actions may well damage the
property of third parties, but this does not provide carte blanche for
any invasions you may wish to engage in to exclude. To clarify,
exclusion is only justified against aggressors, however exclusion
against an aggressor may or may not involve damage to the property of
third parties, this damage can only be justified if it is required to
exclude the aggressor.</p>
