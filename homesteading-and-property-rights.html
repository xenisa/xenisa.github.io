<h1 id="the-homesteading-principle">The Homesteading Principle</h1>
<h2 id="derivation-from-the-non-aggression-principle">Derivation from
the Non-Aggression Principle</h2>
<p>Now that the non-aggression principle has been demonstrated as an
apodictically correct axiom of law some initial implications can be
derived, the first of which is the homesteading principle, which can be
stated as: ownership is assigned to the initial possessor/director of
any external good, where <em>homesteading</em> is defined as initial
possession (it is not particularly relevant whether you define
homesteading as initial possession or initial direction, the initial
possessor of a good is the one who initially directs the use of it,
however I prefer the terminology of direction in most cases as will be
made clear later). You will often see this described as the prior-later
distinction, that is, the homesteading principle gives precedence to the
first comer over any latecomers.</p>
<p>Consider Crusoe and Friday, stranded on a desert island. Crusoe comes
across a stick in nature and homesteads it–i.e. takes initial possession
of it–then he fashions it into a spear which he plans to use for
spearfishing. On his way to the ocean, however, Friday sees this stick
and thinks that it would be a useful tool to stoke his fire, and so he
attempts to re-possess it–that is take it–from Crusoe. We have a
conflict, Crusoe can’t spearfish at the same time that Friday stokes his
fire, and it is intuitively clear that Friday has initiated this
conflict.</p>
<p>First, it must be noted that ownership is necessarily distinct from
direction, and this is pre-supposed as true by both Crusoe and Friday—in
asserting different ownership claims they are saying that they are the
ones who <em>justly</em> direct the use of the stick, i.e. if someone
else tries to do so, that is <em>unjust</em>. We know this, because
<em>ownership</em> itself is defined as just direction. Kinsella points
out<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
that the fact that ownership and
direction<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
are distinct implies that only first possession/direction is
justifiable. If <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> can become
the owner of a thing by merely taking it from <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, that means that <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> could take it from <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> and thereby become the owner—but
this would mean that the actual ability to direct the use of a thing and
ownership of that thing are not distinct; whomever is able to control
the stick would be the owner, and this contradicts the presumption by
all parties that ownership and direction <em>are</em> distinct.
Therefore, as it is a contradiction to propose that the latecomer has a
property right, we are left with the initial director having the only
justifiable claim to the property right—initial direction is the only
just direction, and therefore it is only the homesteader who has the
unique status of ownership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, we can see not only that Lockean homesteading […] is
inextricably bound up with the prior-later distinction […]
<strong><em>but that the very idea of ownership implies that only
libertarian-style ownership is
justifiable</em></strong>.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-criteria-for-property-borders">The Criteria for Property
Borders</h2>
<p>So property rights are conflict avoiding norms and are assigned to
the first-comer rather than any late-comer, and from this fact we can
derive a corollary about the nature of a legitimate homesteading claim,
namely that the borders of said homesteaded property must be objective
and intersubjectively ascertainable. This fact becomes clear when we
break it down into its constituent parts; firstly the borders of the
homesteaded property must be objective, that is they must adhere to
existence as against the arbitrary content of ones consciousness. This
is because subjective property borders might contradict, and thus a
subjective system of property rights is irrational and could not make
for universal law, you will recall that law must be universal and
objective to be
rational.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
Consider a system of property rights based upon such arbitrary decrees,
for example <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> having the right
to punch <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> but <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> not having the right to punch
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. This system would not be
objective, neither <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> nor <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> could rationally derive such a
rule, and as such you could not be expected to follow it, what this
means is that an arbitrary system of property rights like this cannot
avoid conflicts—it would rather authorise them.</p>
<p>Now we turn to the criterion that property borders must be
intersubjectively ascertainable—what this means is that they are
“public” and can be seen or in some other way perceived by third
parties. The reason why rational property borders must be
intersubjectively ascertainable is that if they are not they cannot
serve to avoid conflicts, and property rights are conflict avoiding
norms. Consider a non-intersubjectively ascertainable property border
such as a mere verbal decree—Robinson Crusoe decides that he wants to
own the moon so he simply shouts to the forest that he now owns the
moon. Clearly this verbal decree cannot serve to avoid conflicts, when
an astronaut is approaching the moon he has no means of discovering
Crusoes supposed property right in the moon, thus Crusoe has not
actually homesteaded the moon—he has not erected an objective,
intersubjectively ascertainable border.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] no one could ever deny that norms for determining the ownership
of scarce goods are useful for allowing conflict-free exploitation of
such resources. But, as Hoppe points out, there are only two fundamental
alternatives for acquiring unowned property: (1) by doing something with
things with which no one else had ever done anything before, that is,
the Lockean concept of mixing of labour, or homesteading; or (2) simply
by verbal declaration or decree. However, a rule that allows property to
be owned by mere verbal declaration cannot serve to avoid conflicts,
since any number of people could at any time assert conflicting claims
of ownership of a particular scarce resource. Only the first
alternative, that of Lockean homesteading, establishes an objective […]
link between a particular person and a particular scarce resource, and
thus no one can deny the Lockean right to homestead unowned
resources.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What these criteria for rational property borders highlight is that
communication lies at the very root of law. In homesteading a particular
scarce resource you have to be able to somehow communicate to others
that you are using it, if you fail at this you fail at your task of
homesteading and cannot be said to own the thing in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="homestead-stalemates">Homestead Stalemates</h2>
<p>An important edge-case must be analysed for this theory to be
complete, namely the instance of Crusoe and Friday simultaneously
attempting to take possession of a stick in nature. Clearly neither came
prior to the other, so it is improper to describe either as a first- or
late-comer. In this situation Crusoe and Friday are in a stalemate,
where the term “stalemate” is used to indicate that this is not a
conflict. From the definition of the hypothetical, we know that neither
Crusoe nor Friday have actually started engaging in their chosen action
with the stick, as in the first instant the stick was in nature, then
the very next instant both Crusoe and Friday made an attempt to begin
acting with it. This attempt is not yet complete and the action has not
yet started until the other backs off.</p>
<p>Such a stalemate situation may turn into a conflict if either Crusoe
or Friday forcefully excludes the other from completing their
homesteading of the stick. This is a situation of the forceful one, say
Crusoe, excluding the other from that which he does not own. This is an
invasion from Crusoe against Friday, therefore Crusoe is the aggressor
and not the proper owner of the stick. Clearly there is now a conflict
over the use of the stick, else Crusoe would not be excluding Friday
from the stick but from something else, and it is Crusoe who has
initiated this conflict. Thus to forcefully exclude the other in a
stalemate situation is to disqualify yourself from ownership of the good
under stalemate, thereby ceding ownership to the other. The simpler case
is when either Crusoe or Friday decide that they will back off on their
own, thus non-aggressively breaking the stalemate and ceding ownership
to the other, more stubborn man.</p>
<h2 id="against-the-georgist-anti-homestead-ethic">Against the Georgist
Anti-Homestead Ethic</h2>
<p>Now we must turn our attention to the Georgist anti-homestead ethic,
which would claim that the first possessor <em>also</em> doesn’t have
the ownership right, and in fact that homesteading itself is a crime
against everyone
else.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>
This ethic fails on the grounds of its very proposal, to engage in
argumentation one must first homestead <em>something</em>, at the very
least their standing room. Before beginning any ethical deliberation you
therefore must accept it to be just–that is to say argumentatively
justifiable–to take initial possession and to therefore initially direct
the use of some scarce physical means.</p>
<p>Hoppe explains that a latecomer ethic implies the death of
humanity:<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is wrong with this idea of dropping the prior-later distinction
as morally irrelevant? First, if the late-comers, i.e., those who did
not in fact do something with some scarce goods, had indeed as much of a
right to them as the first-comers, i.e., those who did do something with
the scarce goods, then literally no one would be allowed to do anything
with anything, as one would have to have all of the late-comers’ consent
prior to doing whatever one wanted to do. Indeed, as posterity would
include one’s children’s children—people, that is, who come so late that
one could never possibly ask them—advocating a legal system that does
not make use of the prior-later distinction as part of its underlying
property theory is simply absurd in that it implies advocating death but
must presuppose life to advocate any thing. Neither we, our forefathers,
nor our progeny could, do, or will survive and say or argue anything if
one were to follow this rule. In order for any person—past, present, or
future—to argue anything it must be possible to survive now. Nobody can
wait and suspend acting until everyone of an indeterminate class of
late-comers happens to appear and agree to what one wants to do. Rather,
insofar as a person finds himself alone, he must be able to act, to use,
produce, consume goods straightaway, prior to any agreement with people
who are simply not around yet (and perhaps never will be). And insofar
as a person finds himself in the company of others and there is conflict
over how to use a given scarce resource, he must be able to resolve the
problem at a definite point in time with a definite number of people
instead of having to wait unspecified periods of time for unspecified
numbers of people. Simply in order to survive, then, which is a
prerequisite to arguing in favor of or against anything, property rights
cannot be conceived of as being timeless and nonspecific regarding the
number of people concerned. Rather, they must necessarily be thought of
as originating through acting at definite points in time for definite
acting individuals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the idea of abandoning the prior-later distinction,
which socialism finds so attractive, would again simply be incompatible
with the nonaggression principle as the practical foundation of
argumentation. To argue and possibly agree with someone (if only on the
fact that there is dis agreement) means to recognize each other’s prior
right of exclusive control over his own body. Otherwise, it would be
impossible for anyone to first say anything at a definite point in time
and for someone else to then be able to reply, or vice versa, as neither
the first nor the second speaker would be independent physical
decision-making units anymore, at any time. Eliminating the prior-later
distinction then, as socialism attempts to do, is tantamount to
eliminating the possibility of arguing and reaching agreement. However,
as one cannot argue that there is no possibility for discussion without
the prior control of every person over his own body being recognized and
accepted as fair, a late-comer ethic that does not wish to make this
difference could never be agreed upon by anyone. Simply saying that it
could implies a contradiction, as one’s being able to say so would
presuppose one’s existence as an independent decision-making unit at a
definite point in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="self-ownership">Self-Ownership</h1>
<p>Above the homestead principle was defined as “ownership is assigned
to the initial possessor/director of any <em>external</em> good.” This
is important because the above analysis only works for goods which are
external to the body of an acting man, it assumes that there are already
acting men going into nature and extracting various goods from it. A
persons body is an entirely different type of object, there aren’t
bodies out in nature waiting for some “soul” to come along and homestead
them. Rather a body is necessarily linked to an actor. It is this
objective link which imbues a man with ownership. Homesteading is merely
one form of demonstrating this link, so how do we deal with the case of
establishing links between acting men and the bodies used for
action?</p>
<p>Recall that property rights in general are conflict avoiding norms,
that is to say, the very nature of ownership is to avoid conflicts.
Recall also that this was derived from the nature of argumentation
itself, so we can go back to argumentation to derive an assignment of
property rights in bodies; for <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> to argue with each other, they
have to first assume that the other guy owns himself, imagine if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> tried to argue that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is actually owned by <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. Well, this would mean that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> would be a mere mouthpiece for
<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> and thus <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> would actually be arguing with
<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> which contradicts the
presumption that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is arguing
with <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. Therefore, you could
never propose that someone else is a slave without contradiction, in
trying to demonstrate to this man that he is your or someone elses
slave, you would have to first assume that he owns himself, then propose
that you or someone else owns him—i.e. that he does not own himself. In
other words, to engage in any argument whatsoever you have to first
accept the validity of other mens claim to direct the use of their body,
argumentation becomes impossible to the degree that you reject the
validity of this.</p>
<p>Consider also the discussion above of the importance of property
borders being objective and intersubjectively ascertainable. An
implication of this is that particularistic norms such as <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> being allowed to punch <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> but not the other way around are
false, similarly an arbitrary notion of one group owning another group
must also be discarded. This is because you have an objective,
undeniable-and-thus-intersubjectively-ascertainable link to your own
body. To enslave someone the only way to control their body is
indirectly via coercion–either physical or via threat–to get them to act
how you want. In this case, the slave is still the one directly
controlling their body which is a superior link to the indirect one that
the enslaver has. If arbitrarily coercing others to do what you want
constituted a greater claim over the body of the coerced person it would
be impossible to avoid conflicts over bodies—we would rather have a
system of might making right which is a conflict-authorising system of
property, and thus not a rational system of property at all.</p>
<p>The enslaver also contradicts himself by recognising the precedence
of this link over his own body by using his body to coerce his
slave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, any outsider who claims another’s body cannot deny this
objective link and its special status, since the outsider also
necessarily presupposes this in his own case. This is so because in
seeking dominion over the other, in asserting ownership over the other’s
body, he has to presuppose his own ownership of his body, which
demonstrates he does place a certain significance on this link, at the
same time that he disregards the significance of the other’s link to his
own
body.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we consider that a slavery ethic–i.e. an ethic which
rejects self-ownership–cannot make for a human ethic. To be an ethic for
humanity, it must satisfy two properties; first, it must be universal,
i.e. it must apply to all humans, and second, it must actually ensure
the survival of mankind, or else it would be an anti-human ethic, and an
anti-human ethic could not be proposed without contradiction as you must
first presume that you should be alive and arguing. Rothbard has pointed
out<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>
that if you do not have a system of total self-ownership, two
possibilities remain:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>universal and equal other-ownership, which he calls the “communist”
ethic, or;</li>
<li>partial ownership of one group by another.</li>
</ol>
<p>Universal co-ownership fails on the grounds that it would imply the
near immediate death of humanity because for any person to survive they
must act, and if everyone is co-owned by everyone then any given person
must first ask everyone elses permission before engaging in some action,
but asking permission is itself an action, therefore everyone must
immediately start doing <em>nothing</em>. Further, it is not strictly
possible to purposefully not act, we note that action is defined as
purposeful behaviour, so even in ceasing physical motion a man is acting
insofar as this ceasing is done <em>purposefully</em>. Therefore, this
ethic simply cannot be obeyed no matter what a man chooses to do, as
choosing any option implies action.</p>
<p>Partial ownership of one group by another doesn’t necessarily mean
the death of humanity, but it is not universal—instead of being an ethic
for humans it is an ethic which implies a set of sub-humans ruled by
humans. This is thus a particularistic ethic—it’s a norm of the form one
rule for thee and another for me. But if the partial ownership ethic was
truly rational it must be able to be derived from the nature of the
entities that it applies to. Thus there would have to be some principled
difference between the group of humans and the group of sub-humans. We
know that legal ethics are derived from argumentation, and as such they
would have to apply to all beings with the potential to argue. Therefore
there could be no relevant difference between different groups of humans
with respect to law, as all humans qua acting being have the potential
to engage in argumentation. One could come up with any number of
selection criteria to split mankind into different sets; perhaps one
wants to split man into different races, or nations, or into northern
and southern hemispheres, etc. The point of note is that these different
groups do not have different logics—so any conclusions derived that
apply to arguing beings as such would have to apply to all of them.</p>
<h1 id="on-the-impossibility-of-group-ownership">On the Impossibility of
Group Ownership</h1>
<p>Now that we have a theory of property that accounts for both
self-ownership and external ownership, we can begin to address some
implications of this theory, the first of which is that ownership is
necessarily individual—that is, group ownership is strictly impossible.
Consider a set of people, <span
class="math inline">{<em>A</em>, ⋯, <em>Z</em>}</span>, who each
commonly own a stick. What is to be done about a conflict over the use
of this stick between <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>? There are two
possibilities, either <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is
said to be the just victor, or <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is. If <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, then he owns the stick and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> does not, if <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> then he owns the stick, and <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> does not. But both options
contradict the presumption that every member in the set owned the stick,
therefore group ownership simply cannot occur.</p>
<p>Allow me to go over some supposed solutions to this conundrum, the
first of which is the democratic one. Essentially have all members
within the set vote to determine who the just victor is—still, any who
lost the vote did not own the stick, as their desired possession was
considered unjust. Also consider the set which only consists of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, what vote could possibly be
conducted between these men which would not come out as <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> in favour of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> in favour of <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>? If <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> voted for <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or vice versa there would be no
conflict, and law studies only those set of situations where there is
conflict rather than those where men are in harmonious agreement about
how things should be done.</p>
<p>The next proposal for a solution comes from Roderick Long, he
sates:<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the libertarian view, we have a right to the fruit of our labor,
and we also have a right to what people freely give us. Public property
can arise in both these ways.</p>
<p>Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to
walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community
it’s hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen
branches in the way. But over time, the way is cleared and a path forms
— not through any centrally coordinated effort, but simply as a result
of all the individuals walking that way day after day.</p>
<p>The cleared path is the product of labor — not any individual’s
labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take
advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging
tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the
villagers together have earned.</p>
<p>Public property can also be the product of gift. In 19th-century
England, it was common for roads to be built privately and then donated
to the public for free use. This was done not out of altruism but
because the roadbuilders owned land and businesses alongside the site of
the new road, and they knew that having a road there would increase the
value of their land and attract more customers to their businesses.
Thus, the unorganized public can legitimately come to own land, both
through original acquisition (the mixing of labor) and through voluntary
transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Long provides two cases that he sees as legitimate group property;
(1) where a group communally “mix their labour” with an object in
nature, and (2) where a man transfers ownership of his private property
to a group in common. The issue with (1) is that Long relies on the
faulty labour theory of property. It is not mixing labour with land
which imbues a man with ownership, as we have seen it is the nature of
scarcity giving rise to the potential for conflict which implies
property rights. To demonstrate the failure of this theory more
thorougly, allow me to quote Kinsella at
length:<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As noted before, some libertarian IP advocates, such as Rand, hold
that creation is the source of property rights. This confuses the nature
and reasons for property rights, which lie in the undeniable fact of
scarcity. Given scarcity and the correspondent possibility of conflict
in the use of resources, conflicts are avoided and peace and cooperation
are achieved by allocating property rights to such resources. And the
purpose of property rights dictates the nature of such rules. For if the
rules allocating property rights are to serve as objective rules that
all can agree upon so as to avoid conflict, they cannot be biased or
arbitrary. For this reason, unowned resources come to be
owned—homesteaded or appropriated—by the first possessor.</p>
<p>The general rule, then, is that ownership of a given scarce resource
can be identified by determining who first occupied it. There are
various ways to possess or occupy resources, and different ways to
demonstrate or prove such occupation, depending upon the nature of the
resource and the use to which it is put. Thus, I can pluck an apple from
the wild and thereby homestead it, or I can fence in a plot of land for
a farm. It is sometimes said that one form of occupation is “forming” or
“creating” the thing. For example, I can sculpt a statue from a block of
marble, or forge a sword from raw metal, or even “create” a farm on a
plot of land.</p>
<p>We can see from these examples that creation is relevant to the
question of ownership of a given “created” scarce resource, such as a
statue, sword, or farm, only to the extent that the act of creation is
an act of occupation, or is otherwise evidence of first occupation.
However, “creation” itself does not justify ownership in things; it is
neither necessary nor sufficient. One cannot create some possibly
disputed scarce resource without first using the raw materials used to
create the item. But these raw materials are scarce, and either I own
them or I do not. If not, then I do not own the resulting product. If I
own the inputs, then, by virtue of such ownership, I own the resulting
thing into which I transform them.</p>
<p>Consider the forging of a sword. If I own some raw metal (because I
mined it from ground I owned), then I own the same metal after I have
shaped it into a sword. I do not need to rely on the fact of creation to
own the sword, but only on my ownership of the factors used to make the
sword. And I do not need creation to come to own the factors, since I
can homestead them by simply mining them from the ground and thereby
becoming the first possessor. On the other hand, if I fashion a sword
using your metal, I do not own the resulting sword. In fact, I may owe
you damages for trespass or conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long’s second case, where a man transfers title to his property to
some group, fails on the grounds that it does not resolve the
contradiction, therefore making that contract invalid. Contract theory
will be elucidated thorougly in a future lesson, so I will not explain
this point too deeply here, just note that it will be seen that contract
theory arises <em>from</em> property theory, and therefore you cannot
have contracts which allow for contradictory property claims, Long is
essentially putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>A further potential solution for group property rights is the
polycentrist
solution.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup>
To the polycentrist, law in a libertarian society is decided by
reference to competing arbitrators, these judges could settle disputes
and thus determine the arrangement of property. So for our above example
of <span class="math inline">{<em>A</em>, ⋯, <em>Z</em>}</span> all
collectively owning a stick, they would simply have to go to some judge
to decide who has just possession. The problem with this is first that
it is confused about the nature of law—justice cannot be decreed by man,
rather it depends on the normative structure of argumentation. And
second, the contradiction is still not resolved, if this Judge rules in
favour of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> did not own the stick and vice
versa.</p>
<p>Companies are often forwarded as a counterexample to this thesis—it
is said that multiple people can come together and own shares in a given
enterprise and thus communally own said enterprise. This counterexample
is confused about what a company is—men do not go out into nature and
find companies which they then homestead, rather companies are specific
relationships between men, they are constructed via a web of contracts.
Just as a person cannot own friendship or marriage they cannot own a
firm, not legally at least. The specific property being directed by the
company must be owned by a single individual, perhaps the CEO or another
such person. This does not mean the CEO can do whatever he wishes with
this property, it may be the case that there is a contract such that if
he uses the property for purposes contrary to the shareholders
voted-upon goal then the title to that property is transferred to some
other person who then becomes the CEO. Nowhere in such a conception is
any property owned by multiple people.</p>
<h1 id="the-blockean-proviso">The Blockean Proviso</h1>
<p>There is a potential conundrum for this theory of homesteading which
goes as follows:</p>
<p><img src="donut-homestead.svg"
title="A diagram showing a section of land, A, enclosing a section of land, B, via its donut shape."
alt="img" /><sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup></p>
<p>There are three sections of land, <span class="math inline">𝔸</span>,
<span class="math inline">𝔹</span>, and <span
class="math inline">ℂ</span> as pictured. Crusoe comes along and
homesteads <span class="math inline">𝔸</span>. Friday currently resides
somewhere in <span class="math inline">ℂ</span>. Because Crusoe does not
own <span class="math inline">𝔹</span>, Friday does not have a duty to
Crusoe to not enter it. And because Crusoe does own <span
class="math inline">𝔸</span>, Friday does have a duty to Crusoe to not
enter <span class="math inline">𝔸</span>. So, Friday is allowed to enter
<span class="math inline">𝔹</span>, but not <span
class="math inline">𝔸</span>. However, due to the donut shape of Crusoes
homestead, to enter <span class="math inline">𝔹</span> implies entering
<span class="math inline">𝔸</span>, hence, a contradiction arises—Friday
both has a duty not to enter <span class="math inline">𝔹</span> and he
does not have said duty. That is to say, Crusoe is acting like he is the
owner <span class="math inline">𝔹</span> of when he is in fact not—this
is called forestalling. The proposed solution put forward by those in
the Walter Block camp is the Blockean Proviso. Essentially, they claim
that the contradiction arises from assuming that Crusoe has indeed
homesteaded all of <span class="math inline">𝔸</span>, therefore to
resolve the contradiction these donut homesteads must be disallowed.
This formulation, provided by Łukasz Dominiak, resolves a
counterargument made by
Kinsella,<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup>
where he imagines that the donut is not owned by Crusoe himself, but by
100 Crusoes we could call Crusoe<sub>1</sub> through to
Crusoe<sub>100</sub>, which of these individual segments does Friday
have the right to cross over and why not any of the others? Surely if
they each sequentially homesteaded their individual segments, none of
them are individually forestalling. The solution to this is that it is
Crusoe<sub>100</sub>, who seals up the donut who has committed a crime,
as he was not able to homestead that final section.</p>
<p>However, there is a way to resolve this contradiction without any
need for a proviso, as Kinsella writes in defense of
embordering-as-homesteading, utilising de Jasay’s “let exclusion stand”
principle:<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell: de Jasay equates property with its owner’s “excluding”
others from using it, for example by fencing in immovable property
(e.g. land) or finding or creating (and keeping) movable property. Thus,
the principle means “let ownership stand,” i.e., that claims to
ownership of property appropriated from the state of nature or acquired
ultimately through a chain of title tracing back to such an
appropriation should be respected. De Jasay uses this idea to demolish
the criticism that homesteading unowned resources unilaterally and
unjustifiably imposes on others moral duties to refrain from
interfering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I.e. it is the very nature of property itself that the owner excludes
others from using it, we can then say that Crusoe in excluding others
from accessing this previously unowned territory <span
class="math inline">𝔸</span>, thereby becomes its owner. It is this act
of exclusion which <em>is</em> Crusoe initially directing the use of
both the donut and the donut-hole. This idea of “let exclusion stand”
sheds light also on the falsehood of the notion that property rights
must be limited because if they were not I would be permitted to use my
gun to shoot an innocent man. This is false because my property right in
that gun does not mean that I am allowed to use that gun for whatever I
want, it means that I have a right to exclude people from using the gun
for what they want. This isn’t particularly surprising either, I would
also not be permitted to use a stolen gun to shoot someone, who owns the
gun being used for the shooting isn’t relevant to the question of
whether the shooting is just or not. Kinsella goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the de Jasayan idea of “let exclusion stand” or the Hoppean
idea that the prior-later distinction is of crucial importance also
sheds light on the nature of homesteading itself. Often the question is
asked as to what types of acts constitute or are sufficient for
homesteading (or “embordering” as Hoppe sometimes refers to it); what
type of “labor” must be “mixed with” a thing; and to what property does
the homesteading extend? What “counts” as “sufficient” homesteading?
Etc. And we can see that in a way the answer to these questions is
related to the issue of what is the thing in dispute. In other words, if
B claims ownership of a thing possessed (or formerly possessed) by A,
then the very framing of the dispute helps to identify what the thing is
and what counts as possession of it. If B claims ownership of a given
resource, he must want the right to control it according to its nature.
Then the question becomes, did someone else previously control it
(according to its nature); i.e., did someone else already homestead it,
so that B is only a latecomer? This ties in with de Jasay’s “let
exclusion stand” principle, which rests on the idea that if someone is
actually able to control a resource such that others are excluded, then
this exclusion should “stand.” Of course, the physical nature of a given
scarce resource and the way in which humans use such resources will
determine the nature of actions needed to “control” it and exclude
others.</p>
<p>De Jasay, as a matter of fact, considers two basic types of
appropriation: “finding and keeping” and “enclosure.” The former applies
primarily to movable objects that may be found, taken, and hidden or
used exclusively. Since the thing has no other owner, prima facie no one
is entitled to object to the first possessor claiming ownership.</p>
<p>For immovable property (land), possession is taken by “enclosing” the
land and incurring exclusion costs, e.g., erecting a fence (again,
similar to Hoppe’s “embordering”—establishing an objective,
intersubjectively ascertainable border). As in the case with movables,
others’ loss of the opportunity to appropriate the property does not
give rise to a claim sufficient to oust the first possessor (if it did,
it would be an ownership claim).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in the case where Friday is in <span class="math inline">ℂ</span>,
Crusoe instantly becomes the owner of both <span
class="math inline">𝔸</span> and <span class="math inline">𝔹</span>
after he completes his embordering. In the case where Friday is in <span
class="math inline">𝔹</span>, assuming nobody else is in <span
class="math inline">ℂ</span>, Crusoe would become the immediate owner of
both <span class="math inline">𝔸</span> and <span
class="math inline">ℂ</span>, but what of the case where there are
people or homesteaded property in both <span
class="math inline">𝔹</span> and <span class="math inline">ℂ</span>? In
that situation, it becomes clear that Crusoe would indeed be
forestalling in fencing off <span class="math inline">𝔸</span>, as he
<em>could not</em> become the owner of the owned property on either side
of his border. That is to say, this type of fencing off, would be
claiming possession of not unowned land, but of the owned property of
others.</p>
<h1 id="direction-vs-possession-what-is-ownership">Direction vs
Possession: What is Ownership?</h1>
<p>I have come to recognise a slight terminological problem regarding
the definition of “ownership.” Initially for this course I defined
ownership as just possession, that is to say that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> owns <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> can justify his possession of
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>. This terminology strikes me
as being entirely reasonable on its face, and for some purposes–such as
the discussion of homesteading above–it works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>However, there are some issues with using “just possession” as your
definition of ownership. First how does one apply this terminology to
situations where there is no conflict and yet the owner of a thing is
not in possession of it. Consider inviting your friend over to watch
some TV, your friend sits on your sofa and thus he is engaged in some
partial possession of the sofa, and of the sitting room. Given there is
no conflict, could you ask your friend to leave if you no longer want
him to sit there? Well, he was able to justify his possession of his
sitting room so did he not therefore own it? And if he owns it, what
right have you to tell him to leave?</p>
<p>This issue could be solved through some notion of antecedent vs
descendant property
rights,<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup>
i.e. your property right in the sofa and the sitting room is antecedent
to your friends right, and the antecedent right must prevail in a given
conflict. I have no particular issues with others using this
terminology, but it would make the wording of the above proof that
ownership is exclusive a little bit tedious for my liking. As such in
this course I shall use the terminology that ownership is just
direction, which is analogous to de Jasay’s idea that ownership of a
thing involves controlling it and it is also reminiscent of the Misesian
definition of socialism as being a society wherein a single will directs
the factors of production. Furthermore defining ownership in terms of
who has the right to control or direct a given property will be useful
in later lessons when describing the right to retribute and the right of
guardianship as property rights—these things are scarce and so our
property theory has to cover them, but they aren’t physical, so it is
odd to describe them in terms of possession.</p>
<h1 id="on-the-impossibility-of-intellectual-property-rights">On the
Impossibility of Intellectual Property Rights</h1>
<p>This course would be incomplete without at least a brief treatment of
so-called intellectual property rights, though this section will indeed
be brief as I already have an extensive video going over the
topic.<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18" role="doc-backlink">18</a></sup>
All that shall be covered here is a proof that intellectual property
rights are impossible and are rather monopoly grants and a brief
demonstration that said intellectual monopoly grants are per se
criminal.</p>
<p>First to demonstrate that “intellectual property rights” are
impossible, consider the nature of property. To say that person <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has a property right in <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is to say that he should win any
conflict over the use of <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>.
The issue with so-called intellectual property then is that ideas are
not scarce, so there cannot possibly exist property rights over ideas.
If Crusoe finds a stick in nature and figures out how to use it to fish,
his use of the stick excludes Friday, but his use of the idea of
spearfishing does not—Friday is fully capable of finding a
<em>different</em> stick and using that to spearfish at the exact same
time. We notice that Friday needs to find a different <em>stick</em>,
but he does not need to find a different <em>idea</em>. One person
having an idea excludes nobody else from having that same idea, so
conflicts over ideas are strictly impossible.</p>
<p>Should Crusoe exclude others from using this idea of spearfishing, he
is not acting in defense of a property right, therefore. Instead he is
criminally threatening and/or attacking others who want to spearfish. If
a man comes up with a mousetrap design and patents it, then claims to
everyone else that they are now not allowed to make this type of
mousetrap, he is indirectly threatening everyone else with violence,
through the use of the state. Intellectual property therefore
constitutes a criminal threat, and crime is something to be opposed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to adopt a consistent intellectual property ethic is to
accept ethical stasis—the IP ethic could be stated that any latecomer to
an idea must ask the firstcomer to that idea–or their heir–for
permission before using it. But then anyone who is not the first person
to get the idea to ask permission to use ideas must first ask his
permission to ask permission, which they cannot do without first asking
permission to ask permission to ask permission, and so on ad infinitum.
The IP ethic, then, implies the near immediate cessation of all action,
and thus implies the death of humanity, so the IP ethic simply cannot
make for a human ethic.</p>
