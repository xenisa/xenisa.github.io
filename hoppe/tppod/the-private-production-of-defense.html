<h1 id="the-private-production-of-defense">The Private Production of
Defense</h1>
<p>Among the most popular and consequential beliefs of our age is the
belief in collective security. Nothing less significant than the
legitimacy of the modern state rests on this belief.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate that the idea of collective security is a myth
that provides no justification for the modern state, and that all
security is and must be private. Yet, before coming to the conclusion
let me begin with the problem. First, I will present a two-step
reconstruction of the myth of collective security, and at each step
raise a few theoretical concerns.</p>
<p>The myth of collective security can also be called the Hobbesian
myth. Thomas Hobbes, and countless political philosophers and economists
after him, argued that in the state of nature, men would constantly be
at each others’ throats. <em>Homo homini lupus est</em>. Put in modern
jargon, in the state of nature a permanent underproduction of security
would prevail. Each individual, left to his own devices and provisions,
would spend too little on his own defense, and hence, permanent
interpersonal warfare would result. The solution to this presumably
intolerable situation, according to Hobbes and his followers, is the
institution of a state. In order to institute peaceful cooperation among
themselves, two individuals, A and B, require a third independent party,
S, as ultimate judge and peacemaker. However, this third party, S, is
not just another individual, and the good provided by S, that of
security, is not just another “private” good. Rather, S is a
<em>sovereign</em> and has as such two unique powers. On the one hand, S
can insist that his <em>subjects</em>, A and B, not seek protection from
anyone but him; that is, S is a compulsory territorial monopolist of
protection. On the other hand, S can determine unilaterally how much A
and B must spend on their own security; that is, S has the power to
impose taxes in order to provide security “collectively.”</p>
<p>In commenting on this argument, there is little use in quarreling
over whether man is as bad and wolf-like as Hobbes supposes, except to
note that Hobbes’s thesis obviously cannot mean that man is driven only
and exclusively by aggressive instincts. If this were the case, mankind
would have died out long ago. The fact that he did not demonstrates that
man also possesses reason and is capable of constraining his natural
impulses. The quarrel is only with the Hobbesian solution. Given man’s
nature as a rational animal, is the proposed solution to the problem of
insecurity an improvement? Can the institution of a state reduce
aggressive behavior and promote peaceful cooperation, and thus provide
for better private security and protection? The difficulties with
Hobbes’s argument are obvious. For one, regardless of how bad men are,
s—whether king, dictator, or elected president—is still one of them.
Man’s nature is not transformed upon becoming s. Yet how can there be
better protection for A and B, if S must tax them in order to provide
it? is there not a contradiction within the very construction of S as an
expropriating property protector? in fact, is this not exactly what is
also—and more appropriately—referred to as a <em>protection racket</em>?
To besure, S will make peace between A and B but only so that he himself
in turn can rob both of them more profitably. Surely S is better
protected, but the more he is protected, the less A and B are protected
from attacks by s. Collective security, it would seem, is not better
than private security. Rather, it is the private security of the state,
S, achieved through the expropriation, i.e., the economic disarmament,
of its subjects. Further, statists from Thomas Hobbes to James Buchanan
have argued that a protective state S would come about as the result of
some sort of “constitutional” contract.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Yet, who in his right mind would agree to a contract that allowed one’s
protector to determine unilaterally—and irrevocably—the sum that the
protected must pay for his protection; and the fact is, no one ever
has!<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Let me interrupt my discussion here, and return to the reconstruction
of the Hobbesian myth. Once it is assumed that in order to institute
peaceful cooperation between A and B it is necessary to have a state S,
a two-fold conclusion follows. If more than one state exists, S1, S2,
S3, then, just as there can presumably be no peace among A and B without
S, so there can be no peace between the states S1, S2, and S3 as long as
they remain in a state of nature (i.e., a state of anarchy) with regard
to each other. Consequently, in order to achieve <em>universal</em>
peace, political centralization, unification, and ultimately the
establishment of a single world government are necessary.</p>
<p>Commenting on this argument, it is first useful to indicate what can
be taken as non-controversial. To begin with, the argument is correct,
as far as it goes. If the premise is correct, then the consequence
spelled out follows. The empirical assumptions involved in the Hobbesian
account appear at first glance to be borne out by the facts, as well. It
is true that states are constantly at war with each other, and a
historical tendency toward political centralization and global rule does
indeed appear to be occurring. Quarrels arise only with the explanation
of this fact and tendency, and the classification of a single unified
world state as an improvement in the provision of private security and
protection. First, there appears to be an empirical anomaly for which
the Hobbesian argument cannot account. The reason for the warring among
different states S1, S2, and S3, according to Hobbes, is that they are
in a state of anarchy <em>vis-à-vis</em> each other. However, before the
arrival of a single world state not only are S1, S2, and S3 in a state
of anarchy relative to each other but in fact every subject of one state
is in a state of anarchy <em>vis-à-vis</em> every subject of any other
state. Accordingly, there should exist just as much war and aggression
between the private citizens of various states as between different
states. Empirically, however, this is not so. The private dealings
between foreigners appear to be significantly less war-like than the
dealings between different governments. Nor does this seem to be
surprising. After all, a state agent S, in contrast to every one of its
subjects, can rely on domestic taxation in the conduct of his foreign
affairs. Given his natural human aggressiveness, however pronounced it
may initially be, is it not obvious that S will be more brazen and
aggressive in his conduct toward foreigners if he can externalize the
cost of such behavior onto others? Surely, I am willing to take greater
risks and engage in more provocation and aggression if I can make others
pay for it. And surely there is a tendency of one state—one protection
racket—to want to expand its territorial protection monopoly at the
expense of other states and thus bring about, as the ultimate result of
interstate competition, world government.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> But
how is this an improvement in the provision of private security and
protection? The opposite seems to be the case. The world state is the
winner of all wars and the last surviving protection racket. Doesn’t
this make it particularly dangerous? And will not the physical power of
any single world government be overwhelming as compared to that of any
one of its individual subjects?</p>
<h1 id="the-empirical-evidence">The Empirical Evidence</h1>
<p>Let me pause here in my abstract theoretical considerations to take a
brief look at the empirical evidence bearing on the issue at hand. As
noted at the outset, the myth of collective security is as widespread as
it is consequential. I am not aware of any survey on this matter, but I
would venture to predict that the Hobbesian myth is accepted more or
less unquestioningly by well over 90 percent of the adult population.
However, to believe something does not make it true. Rather, if what one
believes is false, one’s actions will lead to failure. What about the
evidence? Does it support Hobbes and his followers, or does it confirm
the opposite anarchist fears and contentions?</p>
<p>The U.S. was explicitly founded as a protective state à la Hobbes.
Let me quote to this effect from Jefferson’s <em>Declaration of
Independence</em>:</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their creator with inalienable rights;
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: that
to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p>
<p>Here we have it: The U.S. government was instituted to fulfill one
and only one task: the protection of life and property. Thus, it should
provide the perfect example for judging the validity of the Hobbesian
claim as to the status of states as protectors. After more than two
centuries of protective statism, what is the status of our protection
and peaceful human cooperation? Was the American experiment in
protective statism a success?</p>
<p>According to the pronouncements of our state rulers and their
intellectual bodyguards (of whom there are more than ever before), we
are better protected and more secure than ever. We are supposedly
protected from global warming and cooling, from the extinction of
animals and plants, from the abuses of husbands and wives, parents and
employers, from poverty, disease, disaster, ignorance, prejudice,
racism, sexism, homophobia, and countless other public enemies and
dangers. In fact, however, matters are strikingly different. In order to
provide us with all this protection, the state managers expropriate more
than 40 percent of the incomes of private producers year in and year
out. Government debt and liabilities have increased without
interruption, thus increasing the need for future expropriations. Owing
to the substitution of government paper money for gold, financial
insecurity has increased sharply, and we are continually robbed through
currency depreciation. Every detail of private life, property, trade,
and contract is regulated by ever higher mountains of laws
(legislation), thereby creating permanent legal uncertainty and moral
hazard. In particular, we have been gradually stripped of the right to
exclusion implied in the very concept of private property. As sellers we
cannot sell to and as buyers we cannot buy from whomever we wish. And as
members of associations we are not permitted to enter into whatever
restrictive covenant we believe to be mutually beneficial. As Americans,
we must accept immigrants we do not want as our neighbors. As teachers,
we cannot get rid of lousy or ill-behaved students. As employers, we are
stuck with incompetent or destructive employees. As landlords, we are
forced to cope with bad tenants. As bankers and insurers, we are not
allowed to avoid bad risks. As restaurant or bar owners, we must
accommodate unwelcome customers. And as members of private associations,
we are compelled to accept individuals and actions in violation of our
own rules and restrictions. In short, the more the state has increased
its expenditures on social security and public safety, the more our
private property rights have been eroded, the more our property has been
expropriated, confiscated, destroyed, or depreciated, and the more we
have been deprived of the very foundation of all protection: economic
independence, financial strength, and personal wealth.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The
path of every president and practically every member of Congress is
littered with hundreds of thousands if not millions of nameless victims
of personal economic ruin, financial bankruptcy, impoverishment,
despair, hardship, and frustration.</p>
<p>The picture appears even bleaker when we consider foreign affairs.
Never during its entire history has the continental U.S. been
territorially attacked by any foreign army. (Pearl Harbor was the result
of a preceding U.S. provocation.) Yet the U.S. has the distinction of
having possessed a government that declared war against a large part of
its own population and engaged in the wanton murder of hundreds of
thousands of its own citizens. Moreover, while the relations between
American citizens and foreigners do not appear to be unusually
contentious, almost from its very beginnings the U.S. government pursued
relentless aggressive expansionism. Beginning with the Spanish-American
War, culminating in World War I and World War II, and continuing to the
present, the U.S. government has become entangled in hundreds of foreign
conflicts and risen to the rank of the world’s dominant imperialist
power. Thus, nearly every president since the turn of this century also
has been responsible for the murder, killing, or starvation of countless
innocent foreigners all over the world. In short, while we have become
more helpless, impoverished, threatened, and insecure, the U.S.
government has become ever more brazen and aggressive. In the name of
national security, it defends us, equipped with enormous stockpiles of
weapons of aggression and mass destruction, by bullying ever new
“Hitlers,” big or small, and all suspected Hitlerite sympathizers
anywhere and everywhere outside of the territory of the U.S.<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The empirical evidence thus seems clear. The belief in a protective
state appears to be a patent error, and the American experiment in
protective statism a complete failure. The U.S. government does not
protect us. To the contrary, there exists no greater danger to our life,
property, and prosperity than the U.S. government, and the U.S.
president in particular is the world’s single most threatening and armed
danger, capable of ruining everyone who opposes him and destroying the
entire globe.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-think-about-the-statist-response">How to Think About the
Statist Response</h1>
<p>Statists react much like socialists when faced with the dismal
economic performance of the Soviet Union and its satellites. They do not
necessarily deny the disappointing facts, but they try to argue them
away by claiming that these facts are the result of a systematic
discrepancy (deviancy) between “real” and “ideal” or “true” statism,
respectively socialism. To this day, socialists claim that “true”
socialism has not been refuted by the empirical evidence, and everything
would have turned out well and unparalleled prosperity would have
resulted, if only Trotsky’s, or Bucharin’s, or better still their very
own brand of socialism, rather than Stalin’s, had been implemented.
Similarly, statists interpret all seemingly contradictory evidence as
only accidental. If only some other president had come to power at this
or that turn in history, or if only this or that constitutional change
or amendment had been adopted, everything would have turned out
beautifully, and unparalleled security and peace would have resulted.
Indeed, this may still happen in the future, if their own policies are
employed.</p>
<p>We have learned from Ludwig von Mises how to respond to the
socialists’ evasion (immunization) strategy.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> As
long as the defining characteristic—the essence—of socialism, i.e., the
absence of the private ownership of the factors of production, remains
in place, no reform will be of any help. The idea of a socialist economy
is a <em>contradictio in adjecto</em>, and the claim that socialism
represents a higher, more efficient mode of social production is absurd.
In order to reach one’s own ends efficiently and without waste within
the framework of an exchange economy based on division of labor, it is
necessary that one engage in monetary calculation(cost-accounting).
Everywhere outside the system of a primitive self-sufficient single
household economy, monetary calculation is the sole tool of rational and
efficient action. Only by being able to compare inputs and outputs
arithmetically in terms of a common medium of exchange (money) can a
person determine whether his actions are successful or not. In distinct
contrast, socialism means to have no economy, no economizing, at all,
because under these conditions monetary calculation and cost-accounting
is impossible by definition. If no private property in the factors of
production exists, then no prices for any production factor exist;
hence, it is impossible to determine whether or not they are employed
economically. Accordingly, socialism is not a higher mode of production
but rather economic chaos and regression to primitivism.</p>
<p>How to respond to the statists’ evasion strategy has been explained
by Murray N. Rothbard.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> But Rothbard’s lesson, while equally
simple and clear and with even more momentous implications, has remained
to this day far less known and appreciated. So long as the defining
characteristic—the essence—of a state remains in place, he explained, no
reform, whether on the level of personnel or of the constitution, will
be to any avail. <em>Given</em> the principle of government—judicial
monopoly and the power to tax—any notion of limiting its power and
safeguarding individual life and property is illusory. Under
monopolistic auspices the price of justice and protection must rise and
its quality must fall. A tax-funded protection agency is a contradiction
in terms and will lead to ever more taxes and less protection. Even if a
government limited its activities exclusively to the protection of
pre-existing property rights (as every protective state is supposed to
do), the further question of <em>how much</em> security to provide would
arise. Motivated (like everyone else) by self-interest and the
disutility of labor, but with the unique power to tax, a government’s
answer will invariably be the same: to <em>maximize expenditures</em> on
protection—and almost all of a nation’s wealth can conceivably be
consumed by the cost of protection—and at the same time to
<em>minimize</em> the <em>production</em> of protection. Furthermore, a
judicial monopoly must lead to a deterioration in the quality of justice
and protection. If one can only appeal to government for justice and
protection, justice and protection will be perverted in favor of
government, constitutions, and supreme courts notwithstanding. After
all, constitutions and supreme courts are <em>state</em> constitutions
and courts, and whatever limitations to government action they might
contain is determined by agents of the very institution under
consideration. Accordingly, the definition of property and protection
will continually be altered and the range of jurisdiction expanded to
the government’s advantage.</p>
<p>Hence, Rothbard pointed out, it follows that just as socialism cannot
be reformed but must be abolished in order to achieve prosperity, so can
the institution of a state not be reformed but must be abolished in
order to achieve justice and protection. “Defense in the free society
(including such defense services to person and property as police
protection and judicial findings),” Rothbard concluded, “would therefore
have to be supplied by people or firms who (a) gained their revenue
voluntarily rather than by coercion and (b) did not—as the state
does—arrogate to themselves a compulsory monopoly of police or judicial
protection… defense firms would have to be as freely competitive and as
noncoercive against noninvaders as are all other suppliers of goods and
services on the free market. Defense services, like all other services,
would be marketable and marketable only.”<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
That is, every private property owner would be able to partake of the
advantages of the division of labor and seek better protection of his
property than that afforded through self-defense by cooperation with
other owners and their property. Anyone could buy from, sell to, or
otherwise contract with anyone else concerning protective and judicial
services, and one could at any time unilaterally discontinue any such
cooperation with others and fall back on self-reliant defense, or change
one’s protective affiliations.</p>
<h1 id="the-case-for-private-security">The Case for Private
Security</h1>
<p>Having reconstructed the myth of collective security—the myth of the
state—and criticized it on theoretical and empirical grounds, I now must
take on the task of constructing the positive case for private security
and protection. In order to dispel the myth of collective security, it
is not just sufficient to grasp the <em>error</em> involved in the idea
of a protective state. It is just as important, if not more so, to gain
a clear understanding of how the non-statist security alternative would
effectively work. Rothbard, building on the pathbreaking analysis of the
French-Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari,<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> has
given us a sketch of the workings of a free-market system of protection
and defense.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> As well, we owe Morris and Linda
Tannehill for their brilliant insights and analyses in this regard.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Following their lead, I will
proceed deeper in my analysis and provide a more <em>comprehensive</em>
view of the alternative-non-statist-system of security production and
its ability to handle attacks, not just by individuals or gangs but in
particular also by <em>states</em>.</p>
<p>There exists widespread agreement—among liberal-libertarians such as
Molinari, Rothbard, and the Tannehills as well as most other
commentators on the matter—that defense is a form of insurance, and
defense expenditures represent a sort of insurance premium (price).
Accordingly, as Rothbard and the Tannehills in particular would
emphasize, within the framework of a complex modern economy based on a
worldwide division of labor the most likely candidates for offering
protection and defense services are insurance agencies. The better the
protection of insured property, the lower are the damage claims and
hence an insurer’s costs. Thus, to provide efficient protection appears
to be in every insurer’s own financial interest; and in fact even now,
although restricted and hampered by the state, insurance agencies
provide wide-ranging services of protection and indemnification
(compensation) to injured private parties. Insurance companies fulfill a
second essential requirement. Obviously, anyone offering protection
services must appear able to deliver on his promises in order to find
clients. That is, he must possess the economic means—the manpower as
well as the physical resources—necessary to accomplish the task of
dealing with the dangers, actual or imagined, of the real world. On this
count insurance agencies appear to be perfect candidates, too. They
operate on a nationwide and even international scale, and they own large
property holdings dispersed over wide territories and beyond single
state boundaries. Accordingly, they have a manifest self-interest in
effective protection, and are big and economically powerful.
Furthermore, all insurance companies are connected through a network of
contractual agreements of mutual assistance and arbitration as well as a
system of international reinsurance agencies, representing a combined
economic power which dwarfs that of most if not all existing
governments.</p>
<p>I want to further analyze and systematically clarify this suggestion:
that protection and defense are insurance and can be provided by
insurance agencies. To reach this goal, two issues must be addressed.
First, it is not possible to insure oneself against every risk of life.
I cannot insure myself against committing suicide, for instance, or
against burning down my own house, or becoming unemployed, or not
feeling like getting out of bed in the morning, or not suffering
entrepreneurial losses, because in each case I have full or partial
control over the likelihood of the respective outcome. Risks such as
these must be assumed individually. No one except myself can possibly
deal with them. Hence, the first question will have to be what makes
protection and defense an insurable rather than an uninsurable risk?
After all, as we have just seen, this is not self-evident. In fact,
doesn’t everyone have considerable control over the likelihood of an
attack on and invasion of his person and property? Do I not deliberately
bring about an attack by assaulting or provoking someone else, for
instance, and is not protection then an uninsurable risk, like suicide
or unemployment, for which each person must assume sole
responsibility?</p>
<p>The answer is a qualified yes and no. Yes, insofar as no one can
possibly offer unconditional protection, i.e., insurance against any
invasion whatsoever. That is, unconditional protection can only be
provided, if at all, by each individual on his own and for himself. But
the answer is no, <em>insofar</em> as conditional protection is
concerned. Only attacks and invasions that are provoked by the victim
cannot be insured. However, unprovoked and thus accidental attacks can
be insured against.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> That is, protection becomes an
insurable good only if and insofar as an insurance agent contractually
restricts the actions of the insured so as to exclude every possible
provocation on their part. Various insurance companies may differ with
respect to the specific definition of provocation, but there can be no
difference between insurers with regard to the principle that each must
systematically exclude (prohibit) all provocative and aggressive action
among its own clients.</p>
<p>As elementary as this first insight into the essentially
defensive—non-aggressive and nonprovocative—nature of
protection-insurance may seem, it is of fundamental importance. For one,
it implies that any known aggressor and provocateur would be unable to
find an insurer, and hence, would be economically isolated, weak, and
vulnerable. On the other hand, it implies that anyone wanting more
protection than that afforded by self-reliant self-defense could do so
only if and insofar as he submitted himself to specified norms of
non-aggressive, civilized conduct. Furthermore, the greater the number
of insured people—and in a modern exchange economy most people want more
than just self-defense for their protection—the greater would be the
economic pressure on the remaining uninsured to adopt the same or
similar standards of non-aggressive social conduct. Moreover, as the
result of competition between insurers for voluntarily paying clients, a
tendency toward falling prices per insured property values would come
about. At the same time, a tendency toward the standardization and
unification of property and contract law would be set in motion.
Protection contracts with standardized property and product descriptions
would come into existence; and out of the steady cooperation between
different insurers in mutual arbitration proceedings, a tendency toward
the standardization and unification of the rules of procedure, evidence,
and conflict resolution (including compensation, restitution,
punishment, and retribution), and steadily increasing legal certainty
would result. Everyone, by virtue of buying protection insurance, would
be tied into a global competitive enterprise of striving to minimize
aggression (and thus maximize defensive protection), and every single
conflict and damage claim, regardless of where and by or against whom,
would fall into the jurisdiction of exactly one or more enumerable and
specific insurance agencies and their mutually defined arbitration
procedures.</p>
<h1 id="more-on-aggression-insurance">More on Aggression Insurance</h1>
<p>Now a second question must be addressed. Even if the status of
defensive protection as an insurable good is granted, distinctly
different forms of insurance exist. Let us consider just two
characteristic examples: insurance against natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes and insurance against industrial
accidents or disasters, such as malfunctions, explosions, or defective
products. The former can serve as an example of group or mutual
insurance. Some territories are more prone to natural disasters than
others; as a result the demand for and price of insurance will be higher
in some areas than others. However, every location <em>within</em>
certain territorial borders is regarded by the insurer as homogeneous
with respect to the risk concerned. The insurer presumably knows the
frequency and extent of the event in question for the region as a whole,
but he knows nothing about the particular risk of any specific location
within the territory. In this case, every insured person will pay the
same premium per insured value, and the premiums collected in one time
period are presumably sufficient to cover all damage claims during the
same time period (otherwise the insurance industry will have losses).
Thus, the particular individual risks are pooled and insured
mutually.</p>
<p>In contrast, industrial insurance can serve as an example of
individual insurance. Unlike natural disasters, the insured risk is the
outcome of human action, i.e., of production efforts. Every production
process is under the control of an individual producer. No producer
<em>intends</em> failure or disaster, and as we have seen only
accidental—non-intended—disasters are insurable. Yet even if largely
controlled and generally successful, every producer and production
technology is subject to occasional mishaps and accidents beyond his
control—a margin of error. However, as the outcome, even if unintended,
of individual production efforts and production techniques, this risk of
industrial accidents is essentially different from one producer and
production process to another. Accordingly, the risk of different
producers and production technologies cannot be pooled, and every
producer must be insured individually. In this case, the insurer
presumably will have to know the frequency of the questionable event
over time, but he knows nothing of the likelihood of the event at any
specific point in time, except that at all times the same producer and
production technology is in operation. There is no presumption that the
premiums collected during any given period will be sufficient to cover
all damage claims arising during that period. Rather, the profit-making
presumption is that all premiums collected over many time periods will
be sufficient in order to cover all claims during the same multiperiod
time span. Consequently, in this case an insurer must hold capital
reserves in order to fulfill its contractual obligation, and in
calculating his premiums he must take the present value of these
reserves into account.</p>
<p>The second question is, then, what kind of insurance can protect
against aggression and invasion by other actors? Can it be provided as
group insurance, as for natural disasters, or will it have to be offered
in the form of individual insurance, as in the case of industrial
accidents?</p>
<p>Let me note at the outset that both forms of insurance represent only
the two possible extremes of a continuum, and that the position of any
particular risk on this continuum is not definitively fixed. Owing to
scientific and technological advances in meteorology, geology, or
engineering, for instance, risks that were formerly regarded as
homogeneous (allowing for mutual insurance) can become more and more
de-homogenized. Noteworthy is this tendency in the field of medical and
health insurance. With the advances of genetics and genetic
engineering—genetic fingerprinting—medical and health risks previously
regarded as homogeneous (unspecific) with respect to large numbers of
people have become increasingly more specific and heterogeneous.</p>
<p>With this in mind, can anything specific be said about protection
insurance in particular? I would think so. After all, while all
insurance requires that the risk be accidental from the standpoint of
the insurer and the insured, the accident of an aggressive invasion is
distinctly different from that of natural or industrial disasters.
Whereas natural disasters and industrial accidents are the outcome of
natural forces and the operation of laws of nature, aggression is the
outcome of human actions; and whereas nature is blind and does not
discriminate between individuals, whether at the same point in time or
over time, an aggressor can discriminate and deliberately target
specific victims and choose the timing of his attack.</p>
<h1 id="political-borders-and-insurance">Political Borders and
Insurance</h1>
<p>Let me first contrast defense-protection insurance with that against
natural disasters. Frequently an analogy between the two is drawn, and
it is instructive to examine if or to what extent it holds. The analogy
is that just as every individual within certain geographical regions is
threatened by the same risk of earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes, so
does every inhabitant within the territory of the U.S. or Germany, for
instance, face the same risk of being victimized by a foreign attack.
Some superficial similarity—to which I shall come
shortly—notwithstanding, it is easy to recognize two fundamental
shortcomings in the analogy. For one, the borders of earthquake, flood,
or hurricane regions are established and drawn according to objective
physical criteria and hence can be referred to as natural. In distinct
contrast, political boundaries are artificial boundaries. The borders of
the U.S. changed throughout the entire 19th century, and Germany did not
exist as such until 1871, but was composed of nearly 50 separate
countries. Surely, no one would want to claim that this redrawing of the
U.S. or German borders was the outcome of the discovery that the
security risk of every American or German within the greater U.S. or
Germany was, contrary to the previously held opposite belief,
homogeneous (identical).</p>
<p>There is a second obvious shortcoming. Nature—earthquakes, floods,
hurricanes—is blind in its destruction. It does not discriminate between
more and less valuable locations and objects, but attacks
indiscriminately. In distinct contrast, an aggressor-invader can and
does discriminate. He does not attack or invade worthless locations and
things, like the Sahara Desert, but targets locations and things that
are valuable. Other things being equal, the more valuable a location and
an object, the more likely it will be the target of an invasion.</p>
<p>This raises the crucial next question. If political borders are
arbitrary and attacks are in any case never indiscriminate but directed
specifically toward valuable places and things, are there any
non-arbitrary borders separating different security-risk (attack) zones?
The answer is yes. Such non-arbitrary borders are those of private
property. Private property is the result of the appropriation and/or
production of particular physical objects or effects by specific
individuals at specific locations. Every appropriator-producer (owner)
demonstrates with his actions that he regards the appropriated and
produced things as valuable (goods), otherwise he would not have
appropriated or produced them. The borders of everyone’s property are
objective and intersubjectively ascertainable. They are simply
determined by the extension and dimension of the things appropriated
and/or produced by any one particular individual. And the borders of all
valuable places and things are coextensive with the borders of all
property. At any given point in time, every valuable place and thing is
owned by someone; only worthless places and things are owned by no
one.</p>
<p>Surrounded by other men, every appropriator and producer can also
become the object of an attack or invasion. Every property—in contrast
to things (matter)—is necessarily valuable; hence, every property owner
becomes a possible target of other men’s aggressive desires.
Consequently, every owner’s choice of the location and form of his
property will, among countless other considerations, also be influenced
by security concerns. Other things being equal, everyone will prefer
safer locations and forms of property to locations and forms which are
less safe. Yet, regardless of where an owner and his property are
located and whatever the property’s physical form, every owner, by
virtue of not abandoning his property even in view of potential
aggression, demonstrates his personal willingness to protect and defend
these possessions.</p>
<p>However, if the borders of private property are the only
non-arbitrary borders standing in systematic relation to the risk of
aggression, then it follows that as many different security zones as
there are separately owned property holdings exist, and that these zones
are no larger than the extension of these holdings. That is, even more
so than in the case of industrial accidents, the insurance of property
against aggression would seem to be an example of individual rather than
group (mutual) protection.</p>
<p>Whereas the accident-risk of an individual production process is
typically independent of its location—such that if the process were
replicated by the same producer at different locations his margin of
error would remain the same—the risk of aggression against private
property—the production plant—is different from one location to another.
By its very nature, as privately appropriated and produced goods,
property is always separate and distinct. Every property is located at a
different place and under the control of a different individual, and
each location faces a unique security risk. It can make a difference for
my security, for instance, if I reside in the countryside or the city,
on a hill or in a valley, or near or far from a river, ocean, harbor,
railroad or street. In fact, even contiguous locations do not face the
same risk. It can make a difference, for instance, if I reside higher or
lower on the mountain than my neighbor, upstream or downstream, closer
to or more distant from the ocean, or simply north, south, west, or east
of him. Moreover, every property, wherever it is located, can be shaped
and transformed by its owner so as to increase its safety and reduce the
likelihood of an aggression. I may acquire a gun or safe-deposit box,
for instance, or I may be able to shoot down an attacking plane from my
backyard or own a laser gun that can kill an aggressor thousands of
miles away. Thus, no location and no property are like any other. Every
owner will have to be insured individually, and to do so every
aggression-insurer must hold sufficient capital reserves.</p>
<h1 id="the-democratic-state-and-total-war">The Democratic State and
Total War</h1>
<p>The analogy typically drawn between insurance against natural
disasters and external aggression is fundamentally flawed. As aggression
is never indiscriminate but selective and targeted, so is defense.
Everyone has different locations and things to defend, and no one’s
security risk is the same as anyone else’s. And yet the analogy also
contains a kernel of truth. However, any similarity between natural
disasters and external aggression is due <em>not</em> to the nature of
aggression and defense but to the rather specific nature of
state-aggression and defense (interstate warfare). As explained above, a
state is an agency that exercises a compulsory territorial monopoly of
protection and the power to tax, and any such agency will be
comparatively more aggressive because it can externalize the costs of
such behavior onto its subjects. However, the existence of a state does
not just increase the frequency of aggression; it changes its entire
character. The existence of states, and especially of democratic states,
implies that aggression and defense—war—will tend to be transformed into
total, undiscriminating, war.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider for a moment a completely stateless world. Most property
owners would be individually insured by large, often multinational
insurance companies endowed with huge capital reserves. Most if not all
aggressors, being bad risks, would be left without any insurance
whatever. In this situation, every aggressor or group of aggressors
would want to limit their targets, preferably to uninsured property, and
avoid all “collateral damage,” as they would otherwise find themselves
confronted with one or many economically powerful professional defense
agencies. Likewise, all defensive violence would be highly selective and
targeted. All aggressors would be specific individuals or groups,
located at specific places and equipped with specific resources. In
response to attacks on their clients, insurance agencies would
specifically target these locations and resources for retaliation, and
they would want to avoid any collateral damage as they would otherwise
become entangled with and liable to other insurers.</p>
<p>All of this fundamentally changes in a statist world with interstate
warfare. For one, if a state, the U.S., attacks another, for instance
Iraq, this is not just an attack by a limited number of people, equipped
with limited resources and located at a clearly identifiable place.
Rather, it is an attack by all Americans and with all of their
resources. Every American supposedly pays taxes to the U.S. government
and is thus <em>de facto</em>, whether he wishes to be or not,
implicated in every government aggression. Hence, while it is obviously
false to claim that every American faces an equal risk of being attacked
by Iraq, (low or nonexistent as such a risk is, it is certainly higher
in New York City than in Wichita, Kansas, for instance) every American
is rendered equal with respect to his own active, if not always
voluntary, participation in each of his government’s aggressions.</p>
<p>Second, just as the attacker is a state, so is the attacked, Iraq. As
its U.S. counterpart, the Iraqi government has the power to tax its
population or draft it into its armed forces. As taxpayer or draftee,
every Iraqi is implicated in his government’s defense just as every
American is drawn into the U.S. government’s attack. Thus, the war
becomes a war of all Americans against all Iraqis, i.e., total war. The
strategy of both the attacker and the defender state will be changed
accordingly. While the attacker still must be selective regarding the
targets of his attack, if for no other reason than that even taxing
agencies (states) are ultimately constrained by scarcity, the aggressor
has little or no incentive to avoid or minimize collateral damage. To
the contrary, since the entire population and national wealth is
involved in the defensive effort, collateral damage, whether of lives or
property, is even desirable. No clear distinction between combatants and
non-combatants exists. Everyone is an enemy, and all property provides
support for the attacked government. Hence, everyone and everything
becomes fair game. Likewise, the defender state will be little concerned
about collateral damage resulting from its own retaliation against the
attacker. Every citizen of the attacker state and all of their property
is a foe and enemy property and thus becomes a possible target of
retaliation. Moreover, every state, in accordance with this character of
interstate war, will develop and employ more weapons of mass
destruction, such as atomic bombs, rather than long-range precision
weapons, such as my imaginary laser gun.</p>
<p>Thus, the similarity between war and natural catastrophes—their
seemingly indiscriminate destruction and devastation—is exclusively a
feature of a statist world.</p>
<h1 id="insurance-and-incentives">Insurance and Incentives</h1>
<p>This brings on the last problem. We have seen that just as all
property is private, all defense must be insured individually by
capitalized insurance agencies, very much like industrial accident
insurance. Yet, we have also seen that both forms of insurance differ in
one fundamental respect. In the case of defense insurance, the location
of the insured property matters. The premium per insured value will be
different at different locations. Furthermore, aggressors can move
around, their arsenal of weapons may change, and their entire character
of aggression can alter with the presence of states. Thus, even given an
initial property location, the price per insured value can alter with
changes in the social environment or surroundings of this location. How
would a system of competitive insurance agencies respond to this
challenge? In particular, how would it deal with the existence of states
and state aggression?</p>
<p>In answering these questions it is essential to recall some
elementary economic insights. Other things being equal, private property
owners generally, and business owners in particular, prefer locations
with low protection costs (insurance premiums) and rising property
values to those with high protection costs and falling property values.
Consequently, there is a tendency toward the migration of people and
goods from high risk and falling property value areas into low risk and
increasing property value areas. Furthermore, protection costs and
property values are directly related. Other things being equal, higher
protection costs (greater attack risks) imply lower or falling property
values, and lower protection costs imply higher or increasing property
values. These laws and tendencies shape the operation of a competitive
system of insurance-protection agencies.</p>
<p>First, whereas a tax-funded monopolist will manifest a tendency to
raise the cost and price of protection, private profit-loss insurance
agencies strive to reduce the cost of protection and thus bring about
falling prices. At the same time insurance agencies are more interested
than anyone else in rising property values, because this implies not
only that their own property holdings appreciate but in particular that
there will also be more of other people’s property for them to insure.
In contrast, if the risk of aggression increases and property values
fall, there is less value to be insured while the cost of protection and
price of insurance rises, implying poor business conditions for an
insurer. Consequently, insurance companies would be under permanent
economic pressure to promote the former favorable and avert the latter
unfavorable condition.</p>
<p>This incentive structure has a fundamental impact on the operation of
insurers. For one, as for the seemingly easier case of the protection
against common criminals, a system of competitive insurers would lead to
a dramatic change in current crime policy. To recognize the extent of
this change, it is instructive to look first at the present and thus
familiar statist crime policy. While it is in the interest of state
agents to combat common private crime (if only so that there is more
property left for them to tax), as tax-funded agents they have little or
no interest in being particularly effective at the task of preventing
it, or else, if it has occurred, at compensating its victims and
apprehending and punishing the offenders. Moreover, under democratic
conditions, insult will be added to injury. For if everyone—aggressors
as well as non-aggressors and residents of high crime locations as well
as those of low crime locations—can vote and be elected to government
office, a systematic redistribution of property rights from
non-aggressors to aggressors and the residents of low crime areas to
those of high crime areas comes into effect and crime will actually be
promoted. Accordingly, crime, and consequently the demand for private
security services of all kinds are currently at an all-time high. Even
more scandalously, instead of compensating the victims of crimes it did
not prevent (as it should have), the government forces victims to pay
again as taxpayers for the cost of the apprehension, imprisonment,
rehabilitation, and/or entertainment of their aggressors. And rather
than requiring higher protection prices in high crime locations and
lower ones in low crime locations, as insurers would, the government
does the exact opposite. It taxes more in low crime and high property
value areas than in high crime and low property value ones, or it even
subsidizes the residents of the latter locations—the slums—at the
expense of those of the former and thus erodes the social conditions
unfavorable to crime while promoting those favorable to it.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The operation of competitive insurers would be in striking contrast.
For one, if an insurer could not prevent a crime, it would have to
indemnify the victim. Thus, above all insurers would want to be
effective in crime prevention. And if they still could not prevent it,
they would want to be efficient in the detection, apprehension, and
punishment of criminal offenders, because in finding and arresting an
offender, the insurer could force the criminal—rather than the victim
and its insurer—to pay for the damages and cost of indemnification.</p>
<p>More specifically, just as insurance companies currently maintain and
continually update a detailed local inventory of property values so they
would then maintain and continually update a detailed local inventory of
crimes and criminals. Other things being equal, the risk of aggression
against any private property location increases with the proximity and
the number and resources of potential aggressors. Thus, insurers would
be interested in gathering information on actual crimes and known
criminals and their locations, and it would be in their mutual interest
of minimizing property damage to share this information with each other
(just as banks now share information on bad credit risks with each
other). Furthermore, insurers would also be particularly interested in
gathering information on potential (not yet committed and known) crimes
and aggressors, and this would lead to a fundamental overhaul of and
improvement in current—statist—crime statistics. In order to predict the
future incidence of crime and thus calculate its current price
(premium), insurers would correlate the frequency, description, and
character of crimes and criminals with the social surroundings in which
they occur and operate, and develop and under competitive pressure
continually refine an elaborate system of demographic and sociological
crime indicators.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> That is, every neighborhood would
be described, and its risk assessed, in terms and in light of a
multitude of crime indicators, such as the composition of sexes, age
groups, races, nationalities, ethnicities, religions, languages,
professions, and incomes.</p>
<p>Consequently, and in distinct contrast to the present situation, all
interlocal, regional, racial, national, ethnic, religious, and
linguistic income, and wealth redistribution would disappear, and a
constant source of social conflict would be removed permanently.
Instead, the emerging price (premium) structure would tend to accurately
reflect the risk of each location and its particular social surrounding,
such that no one would be forced to pay for the insurance risk of anyone
but his own and that associated with his particular neighborhood. More
importantly, based on its continually updated and refined system of
statistics on crime and property values and further motivated by the
noted migration tendency from high-risk-low-value (henceforth “bad”) to
low-risk-high-value (henceforth “good”) locations, a system of
competitive aggression insurers would promote a tendency toward
civilizational progress (rather than decivilization).</p>
<p>Governments—and democratic governments in particular—erode “good” and
promote “bad” neighborhoods through their tax and transfer policy. They
do so also, and with possibly an even more damaging effect, through
their policy of forced integration. This policy has two aspects. On the
one hand, for the owners and residents in “good” locations and
neighborhoods who are faced with an immigration problem, forced
integration means that they must accept, without discrimination, every
domestic immigrant, as transient or tourist on public roads, as
customer, client, resident, or neighbor. They are prohibited by their
government from excluding anyone, including anyone they consider an
undesirable potential risk, from immigration. On the other hand, for the
owners and residents in “bad” locations and neighborhoods, who
experience emigration rather than immigration, forced integration means
that they are prevented from effective self-protection. Rather than
being allowed to rid themselves of crime through the expulsion of known
criminals from their neighborhood, they are forced by their government
to live in permanent association with their aggressors.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The results of a system of private protection insurers would be in
striking contrast to these all too familiar de-civilizing effects and
tendencies of statist crime protection. To be sure, insurers would be
unable to eliminate the differences between “good” and “bad”
neighborhoods. In fact, these differences might even become more
pronounced. However, driven by their interest in rising property values
and falling protection costs, insurers would promote a tendency to
improve by uplifting and cultivating both “good” and “bad”
neighborhoods. Thus, in “good” neighborhoods insurers would adopt a
policy of selective immigration. Unlike states, they could not and would
not want to disregard the discriminating inclinations among the insured
toward immigrants. To the contrary, even more so than any one of their
clients, insurers would be interested in discrimination: in admitting
only those immigrants whose presence adds to a lower crime risk and
increased property values and in excluding those whose presence leads to
a higher risk and lower property values. That is, rather than
eliminating discrimination, insurers would rationalize and perfect its
practice. Based on their statistics on crime and property values, and in
order to reduce the cost of protection and raise property values,
insurers would formulate and continually refine various restrictive
(exclusionary) rules and procedures relating to immigration and
immigrants and thus give quantitative precision—in the form of prices
and price differentials—to the value of discrimination (and the cost of
non-discrimination) between potential immigrants (as high or low risk
and value-productive).</p>
<p>Similarly, in “bad” neighborhoods the interests of the insurers and
the insured would coincide. Insurers would not want to suppress the
expulsionist inclinations among the insured toward known criminals. They
would rationalize such tendencies by offering selective price cuts
(contingent on specific clean-up operations). Indeed, in cooperation
with one another, insurers would want to expel known criminals not just
from their immediate neighborhood, but from civilization altogether,
into the wilderness or open frontier of the Amazon jungle, the Sahara,
or the polar regions.</p>
<h1 id="insuring-against-state-aggression">Insuring Against State
Aggression</h1>
<p>Yet what about defense against a state? How would insurers protect us
from state aggression?</p>
<p>First, it is essential to remember that governments qua compulsory,
tax-funded monopolies are inherently wasteful and inefficient in
whatever they do. This is also true for weapons technology and
production, military intelligence and strategy, especially in our age of
high technology. Accordingly, states would not be able to compete within
the same territory against voluntarily financed insurance agencies.
Moreover, most important and general among the restrictive rules
relating to immigration and designed by insurers to lower protection
cost and increase property values would be one concerning government
agents. States are inherently aggressive and pose a permanent danger to
every insurer and insured. Thus, insurers in particular would want to
exclude or severely restrict—as a potential security risk—the
immigration (territorial entry) of all known government agents, and they
would induce the insured, either as a condition of insurance or of a
lower premium, to exclude or strictly limit any direct contact with any
known government agent, be it as visitor, customer, client, resident, or
neighbor. That is, wherever insurance companies operated—in all free
territories—state agents would be treated as undesirable outcasts,
potentially more dangerous than any common criminal. Accordingly, states
and their personnel would be able to operate and reside only in
territorial separation from, and on the fringes of, free territories.
Furthermore, owing to the comparatively lower economic productivity of
statist territories, governments would be continually weakened by the
emigration of their most value-productive residents.</p>
<p>Now, what if such a government should decide to attack or invade a
free territory? This would be easier said than done! Who and what would
one attack? There would be no state opponent. Only private property
owners and their private insurance agencies would exist. No one, least
of all the insurers, would have presumably engaged in aggression or even
provocation. If there were any aggression or provocation against the
state at all, this would be the action of a particular person, and in
this case the interest of the state and insurance agencies would fully
coincide. Both would want to see the attacker punished and held
accountable for all damages caused. But without any aggressor-enemy, how
could the state justify an attack and even more so any indiscriminate
attack? And surely it would have to justify it! For the power of every
government, even the most despotic one, rests ultimately on opinion and
consent, as la Boétie, Hume, Mises and Rothbard have explained.<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Kings and presidents can issue an
order to attack, of course. But there must be scores of other men
willing to execute their order to put it into effect. There must be
generals receiving and following the order, soldiers willing to march,
kill, and be killed, and domestic producers willing to continue
producing to fund the war. If this consensual willingness were absent
because the orders of the state rulers were considered illegitimate,
even the seemingly most powerful government would be rendered
ineffectual and collapse, as the recent examples of the Shah of Iran and
the Soviet Union have illustrated. Hence, from the viewpoint of the
leaders of the state an attack on free territories would have to be
considered extremely risky. No propaganda effort, however elaborate,
would make the public believe that its attack were anything but an
aggression against innocent victims. In this situation, the rulers of
the state would be happy to maintain monopolistic control over their
present territory rather than running the risk of losing legitimacy and
all of their power in an attempt at territorial expansion.</p>
<p>However, as unlikely as this may be, what would happen if a state
still attacked and/or invaded a neighboring free territory? In this case
the aggressor would not encounter an unarmed population. Only in statist
territories is the civilian population characteristically unarmed.
States everywhere aim to disarm their own citizenry so as to be better
able to tax and expropriate it. In contrast, insurers in free
territories would not want to disarm the insured. Nor could they. For
who would want to be protected by someone who required him as a first
step to give up his ultimate means of self-defense? To the contrary,
insurance agencies would encourage the ownership of weapons among their
insured by means of selective price cuts.</p>
<p>Moreover, apart from the opposition of an armed private citizenry,
the aggressor state would run into the resistance of not only one but in
all likelihood several insurance and reinsurance agencies. In the case
of a successful attack and invasion, these insurers would be faced with
massive indemnification payments. Unlike the aggressing state, however,
these insurers would be efficient and competitive firms. Other things
being equal, the risk of an attack—and hence the price of defense
insurance—would be higher in locations adjacent or in close proximity to
state territories than in places far away from any state. To justify
this higher price, insurers would have to demonstrate defensive
readiness <em>vis-à-vis</em> any possible state aggression to their
clients, in the form of intelligence services, the ownership of suitable
weapons and materials, and military personnel and training. In other
words, the insurers would be prepared—effectively equipped and
trained—for the contingency of a state attack and ready to respond with
a two-fold defense strategy. On the one hand, insofar as their
operations in free territories are concerned insurers would be ready to
expel, capture, or kill every invader while at the same time trying to
avoid or minimize all collateral damage. On the other hand, insofar as
their operations on state territory are concerned insurers would be
prepared to target the aggressor—the state—for retaliation. That is,
insurers would be ready to counterattack and kill, whether with
long-range precision weapons or assassination commandos, state agents
from the top of the government hierarchy of king, president, or prime
minister on downward while at the same time seeking to avoid or minimize
all collateral damage to the property of innocent civilians (non-state
agents), and they would thereby encourage internal resistance against
the aggressor government, promote its delegitimization, and possibly
incite the liberation and transformation of the state territory into a
free country.</p>
<h1 id="regaining-our-right-to-self-defense">Regaining Our Right to
Self-Defense</h1>
<p>I have thus come full circle with my argument. First, i have shown
that the idea of a protective state and state protection of private
property is based on a fundamental theoretical error, and that this
error has had disastrous consequences: the destruction and insecurity of
all private property and perpetual war. Second, I have shown that the
correct answer to the question of who is to defend private property
owners from aggression is the same as for the production of every other
good or service: private property owners, cooperation based on the
division of labor, and market competition. Third, I have explained how a
system of private profit-loss insurers would effectively minimize
aggression, whether by private criminals or states, and promote a
tendency toward civilization and perpetual peace. The only task
outstanding, then, is to implement these insights: to withdraw one’s
consent and willing cooperation from the state and to promote its
delegitimization in public opinion so as to persuade others to do the
same. Without the erroneous public perception and judgment of the state
as just and necessary and without the public’s voluntary cooperation,
even the seemingly most powerful government would implode and its powers
evaporate. Thus liberated, we would regain our right to self-defense and
be able to turn to freed and unregulated insurance agencies for
efficient professional assistance in all matters of protection and
conflict resolution.</p>
