<blockquote>
<p>Every libertarian would refuse to steal a ladder to save their mom
from a burning building, and refuse to steal a penny to stop aliens from
destroying the world, because every libertarian is a libertarian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moment this statement appeared on my X feed, I wasn’t so much at
a loss for words as I was struck by a familiar, wearying conclusion:
this person believes libertarianism to be a death cult. And sadly, they
are not alone. It would seem that for a growing number of people,
libertarian ethics have been flattened into a binary matter, where a
strict, Spartan adherence is demanded of a “true” libertarian, even if
the price is one’s own life.</p>
<p>For decades, it has been a perennial sport among our critics to
elaborate the most absurd and specific hypotheticals designed to portray
libertarianism as a cold, robotic, and inhuman philosophy. Yet, in a
perverse twist, these same strawmen have become the favored litmus tests
for a faction of libertarians themselves, used to police the boundaries
of an already fragmented movement. The weapon once wielded against us
has been repurposed by our own adherents, seemingly for our own
suicide.</p>
<p>Murray Rothbard had a name for this mindset: the “modal libertarian.”
He identified them as culturally-alienated people, detached from
reality, who cloaked childish rebellion in the language of high
principle. They were, in his estimation, crankish extremists who
disdained all strategy for a “holier than thou” posture, quick to brand
even the movement’s titans as “socialists”, for the terrible crime of
engaging with the world as it <em>is</em> , in the absence of what it
<em>ought</em> to be. Rothbard perfectly captured their level of
seriousness with a dry assessment of their humor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The M[odal Libertarian]’s idea of high wit is someone being on the
receiving end of a hotfoot.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mindset does not build coherent theory. Its adherents do not
reason beyond the most literal and rigid interpretation of our ideals,
nor do they try to bridge the gap between the real world and the ideal.
Their function is not to persuade, but to police. They are the first to
declare that supporting a tax cut is somehow “anti-libertarian,” or that
a policeman defending a victim from a criminal is illegitimate, because
this all constitutes State action. From there, it is a short leap to
branding you a “socialist,” regardless of your arguments, your
contributions, or your history in the cause of liberty.</p>
<p>By this logic, one is forced to ask: was Murray Rothbard not a “real
libertarian” for taking a paycheck from a State university? Is Stephan
Kinsella not one for holding a State-issued law license to practice
within the State’s legal system which he criticizes? If the very
architects of our modern theory fail such a rigid purity test, then what
these dogmatists preach is clearly not libertarianism, but some other,
more brittle and unlivable creed.</p>
<p>We have an old joke, known by all: “If you’ve never been called a
socialist, you’re not a real libertarian.” Infighting in libertarian
circles is as old as the ideology itself, but it has, for the most part,
been productive—unlike the famously sterile schisms of the Randians.
This new wave, however, is different. These modal libertarians have
adopted that same Randian cult mentality, insisting that anyone who
deviates from their rigid interpretation must be excommunicated. For
them, there is no need for constructive debate; libertarianism is a
hermetic, finalized ideology, a perfect system to be defended, not a
living tradition to be explored.</p>
<p>Ironically, for all their claims to doctrinal purity, their
interpretations of libertarian theory are often convoluted, arbitrary,
and wildly ignorant. They style themselves “Hoppeans,” yet conveniently
reject Hoppe’s deontological arguments for border control. They insist
on the Non-Aggression Principle as an objective standard, only to
subjectively redefine it with qualifiers like “intent” defining the
category of voluntary actions. Some even go so far as to argue that
murdering a military conscript is justified, claiming he is a “State
enforcer” who should have chosen prison or death over service.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of this is justified as being rigorously “in line with
the NAP.” This has led some to adopt the label “NAPtist,” a fitting term
for a religious-like devotion to a single principle—or rather, to their
own narrow interpretation of it. The supposed intellectual forefather of
many of them, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, simply calls them “nuts.” I, on the
other hand, will call them something that perfectly captures the absurd
and suicidal logic at the core of their philosophy: <strong>flagpole
libertarians</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="deconstructing-the-absurd-hypotheticals">Deconstructing the
Absurd Hypotheticals</h1>
<p>The central exhibit in the flagpole libertarian’s courtroom is,
predictably, the flagpole dilemma itself. It goes something like this:
imagine you are fixing an antenna on the rooftop of a 20-story apartment
building, and you slip and fall. On your way down, you manage to grab a
flagpole protruding from someone’s balcony. The owner, for reasons of
his own, appears and demand you to let go and plunge to your death. You
are, after all, trespassing on his property. What do you do?</p>
<p>This tired, wildly implausible hypothetical has, of course, never
disproven libertarian theory. The answer for any sane human being is
obvious: you hold on for dear life. You do everything in your power to
survive, and afterward, you make the owner whole. You offer restitution
for the trespass and accept any proportional liability. To do
otherwise—to let go—would be not just absurd but pathological, a
suicidal denial of the most basic human instinct for survival.</p>
<p>For the flagpole libertarian, however, the answer is brutally simple:
you must let go. Your life, at that moment, depends on aggression, and
therefore your claim to it is forfeit. To hold on is to violate your
principles, and thus to cease being a libertarian. It is to relativize
property rights. It is, in their eyes, to slide into the waiting arms of
utilitarianism—instead of the ground below.</p>
<p>This assertion—that violating a principle in a moment of crisis means
you never held it at all—is patently absurd. Does a Christian cease to
be a Christian the moment he sins? Does a socialist abandon his creed by
hiring a gardener? Does a statist become an anarchist by voting for a
tax cut? It would almost seem as if deological labels are primarily
defined by one’s philosophical commitments, not by perfect, robot-like
adherence in every conceivable context.</p>
<p>Even if we grant that, in the strictest sense, your life at that
moment depends on aggression, the flagpole libertarian’s prescription is
philosophically incoherent. To argue that another person must die to
uphold a principle is a performative contradiction: you are affirming
the value of life by engaging in argumentation, while simultaneously
demanding an action that negates your interlocutor’s life. This is not
principle; it is the logic of a death cult.</p>
<h2 id="conflating-morals-rights-and-ethics">Conflating Morals, Rights
and Ethics</h2>
<p>This entire dogmatic vision rests on a fundamental category error
about the nature of our philosophy. Walter Block refutes this stance
very eloquently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They misunderstand the nature of libertarianism. These arguments
implicitly assume that libertarianism is a moral philosophy, a guide to
proper behavior, as it were. Should the flagpole hanger let go? […] But
libertarianism is a theory concerned with the justified use of
aggression, or violence, based on property rights, not morality.
Therefore, the only proper questions which can be addressed in this
philosophy are of the sort, if the flagpole hanger attempts to come in
to the apartment, and the occupant shoots him for trespassing, [w]ould
the forces of law and order punish the home owner?”<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Block’s point strikes at the heart of the matter. The flagpole
libertarian’s error is to confuse a <em>legal principle</em> with a
<em>totalizing moral code</em>. Thinkers from Rothbard to Block to
Kinsella—bricklayers of this ideology—have all stressed this
distinction: the NAP is a theory of justice meant to define legally
enforceable rights, not to dictate every aspect of human morality. The
flagpole libertarian collapses this distinction, treating a theory of
justice as if it were the entire content of virtue; as if it were a
religion.</p>
<p>Libertarianism, as a political theory, offers no moral algorithm for
every conceivable dilemma. It <em><strong>does not</strong></em>
pronounce your personal preferences valid or invalid, nor does it
prescribe whether you should hold on to the flagpole or let go. That
choice remains in the realm of subjective valuation. Whether you
ultimately value your life more than a principle, or a principle more
than your life, is a question of personal ethics. Libertarianism is
concerned with political justice; it does not pretend to impose a
hierarchy of values or have the final word on personal virtue.</p>
<p>The flagpole libertarian’s misunderstanding arises from a conflation
of <em>ethics</em> —external rules of conduct in a society<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>—
and morals—one’s personal perception of right and wrong.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
Because they treat these as one and the same, their logic becomes
hopelessly tangled. They correctly see that rights are derived from
ethics, but by mistaking ethics for morality, they wrongly conclude that
any action violating a right must therefore be immoral. Worse, they
assume such an act constitutes a philosophical rejection of the right
itself.</p>
<p>But morals, by their nature, are subjective. While they are often
shaped by ethical frameworks like the NAP—which one can reasonably argue
through a priori reasoning to be an objective principle—this does not
erase the distinction. Even though we accept that aggression is
<em>objectively</em> unjust, it does not follow that every act of
aggression is <em>subjectively</em> immoral in the eyes of the actor or
society. In an emergency, a person’s subjective values will almost
always take precedence. Ethics can inform our choices, but they cannot
override our nature. They are generally intended to guide behavior in
everyday life, not in every possible edge case. Humans act based on
their own hierarchy of values, not on a pre-programmed ethical script.
To insist otherwise is to deny the very foundation of praxeology.</p>
<p>In the reductionist, jihadist-like interpretation of these
“NAPtists,” no aggression can ever be moral. For them, morality is an
objective matter derived entirely from the ethical rule of
non-aggression. Yet their own arguments often betray a deep
contradiction. They will most often posit a rule like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anything moral must be ethical, but something ethical can still be
immoral.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the first half of that statement is consistent with their
objective framework, the second half shatters it. If an ethical
(non-aggressive) act can still be judged “immoral,” by what standard is
that judgment being made? It cannot be the NAP. It must be some other,
<em>subjective</em> moral code.</p>
<p>If morality is based <em>solely</em> on NAP ethics, then it must
necessarily be binary: aggression is immoral, and non-aggression is
moral. Any judgment beyond that, such as claiming that private drug use
is “immoral,” escapes this pretended objectivity. Since drug use is not
an aggression, a consistent NAP-only moralist has no grounds to condemn
it. To criticize a drug addict, or a degenerate who makes indecent
comments about children, one must appeal to a moral framework
<em>outside</em> of the NAP. At that point, the dogmatist has two
choices: either admit that morality is ultimately subjective, or adopt a
pluralistic moral system (Aristotelian, Christian, Islamic, etc.)—which
is, itself, a subjective choice.</p>
<p>The flagpole libertarian is thus trapped. Either he must retreat to
the sterile position that only aggression is immoral—and that all other
human vices are beyond reproach—or he must recognize the subjective
nature of morality. And if morality is subjective, then his central
claim that holding onto the flagpole is <em>universally</em> immoral
collapses entirely.</p>
<p>The NAP cultist’s error runs deeper than ignoring <strong>personal
subjectivity</strong> ; he also fails to recognize the power of
<strong>normative, intersubjective</strong> morality. In his world, to
physically strike a man indecently exposing himself to a crowd of
children is an immoral act of aggression, plain and simple. Yet in the
real world, virtually no one would condemn such an act. They would see
it as a necessary defense of the innocent, born from a deep-seated,
shared consensus that protecting children is a moral imperative. The act
may be an <em>ethical</em> violation—an aggression under a strict legal
code—but it is not an <em>immoral</em> one by any functioning social or
cultural standard. Otherwise, civilized society would be impossible to
attain.</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella, perhaps more than any other theorist, has
formalized this crucial distinction between rights and morality. With
great clarity, he dismantles the simplistic view that one is merely a
subset of the other in one paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[R]ights are best viewed as metanorms that direct us as to which
laws are just, not directly to personal behavior. Most libertarians
would view rights as a subset of morality; not everything that is
immoral should be illegal, but every rights violation is necessarily
immoral. I believe the sets are intersecting sets only. Just as some
immoral actions are not rights violations, some rights violations might
be morally mandatory (breaking into a cabin to feed your baby in the
middle of a storm). I do believe most rights violations are immoral,
though libertarianism itself cannot make this determination.”<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view of rights as “metanorms” is a necessary, consistent and
central part of a robust libertarian legal theory, a foundation that
allows for a wide diversity of personal moral codes under a single
umbrella of liberty. As Kinsella elaborates, this is precisely why our
movement can accommodate both hedonists and priests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It should not be surprising, therefore, that there are libertarians
who are indeed hedonists and devotees of alternative lifestyles, and
that there are also libertarians who are firm adherents of “bourgeois”
conventional or religious morality. […] That is because libertarianism
per se has no general or personal moral theory.</p>
<p>Libertarianism does not offer a way of life; it offers liberty, so
that each person is free to adopt and act upon his own values and moral
principles. Libertarians agree with Lord Acton that “liberty is the
highest political end” — not necessarily the highest end on everyone’s
personal scale of values.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, he reinforces the point by separating the legal question
from the moral one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[O]ne could argue it is immoral (wrong) to vote—or even that it is
immoral or wrong to commit aggression; but technically speaking, the
morality of one’s actions is not within the province of libertarianism.
Libertarian norms are metanorms that tell us which laws are justified;
they are not normal morals that directly guide human action on a daily
basis. […]</p>
<p>Libertarianism does not directly tell us how to act morally, it only
informs us as to what laws are just.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-unreality-of-armchair-justice">The Unreality of Armchair
Justice</h1>
<p>Having established the flagpole libertarian’s theoretical error, we
now turn to his flawed methodology. He is the perfect specimen of what
we have come to know as the “armchair theorist,” one who believes the
entirety of a legal and social order can be deduced from first
principles through contrived hypotheticals. But where a serious theorist
uses hypotheticals to test a principle’s outer limits, the flagpole
libertarian uses them as ideological bludgeons. He is not interested in
insight or coherent application; he concocts absurd scenarios as litmus
tests, designed to label anyone who seeks a humane or practical solution
most aligned with deontology a “socialist.”</p>
<p>In his rigid worldview, only two paths exist: absolute adherence or
total apostasy. The concept of a principled person committing a
temporary aggression and then <em>reaffirming</em> his principles
through restitution is alien to them. As previously stated, to justify
any aggression, no matter how extreme the duress, is to take a fatal
slide down the utilitarian slope in their view. This exposes a flawed
and deeply inhuman anthropology. They cannot separate the actor from the
act, nor can they accept a basic praxeological truth: that a
self-interested human, however principled, will almost always choose
life over death. It is a demand for a robotic consistency that real
humans cannot meet—a demand made with deep irony, given how many of
these dogmatists also claim the mantle of Objectivism, while asking for
principles to override rational self-interest.</p>
<p>The fundamental flaw in this entire method of armchair theorizing is
its detachment from reality—its utter lack of context. These litmus
tests are useless precisely because real life is not a sterile,
contextless hypothetical in a vacuum. On this point, no one has been
more thorough or devastating than the aforementioned Stephan Kinsella,
who has practically spent a career dismantling this style of
reasoning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[T]heir hypotheticals are almost always too sparse and devoid of
relevant context to permit an answer […] The problem is […] with
libertarian excessive rationalism and armchair theorizing. These hypos
[sic] never specify enough details, and when we answer in black and
white fashion we are assuming there are none, or assuming unrealistic
conditions.</p>
<p>I’d say in the hypo [sic] specified it’s hard to imagine this being
in a real world scenario where the owner is legally entitled to let the
guy fall to his death. Why? Because if something like this ever happened
frequently at all, then there would be legally relevant responses to it,
resulting in a hierarchy of subsidiary rules and conditions that in
effect creates the common law “necessity” right but by contract etc. […]
So the question is: why assume the asshole-hermit-neighbor mentality
would dominate the default/background rules, instead of more reasonable
and neighborly ones? In a real dispute the judge or court can find out
these things and take them into account in the ruling. In hypotheticals,
they are assumed away…”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>”Libertarians sometimes try too hard to “field questions” from the
armchair, when the truth is law has to be formed incrementally based on
real cases where there is a known context, custom, evidence, etc. These
hypos [sic] are not real cases with a real context […] the way real law
is always formed—from actual cases or controversies, not from
libertarian thinkers pontificating about unrealistic, contextless hypos
[sic] from their armchairs or dorm rooms.”<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>”The solution to a given practical and real conflict is not always
immediately apparent from consulting general principles alone; there are
limits to armchair theorizing, rationalist deductivism, and so on. […]
Another reason there needs to be a willingness to negotiate, compromise,
and arbitrate is that perfect knowledge is not always possible, errors
can be made, and reasonable people of good faith can disagree over facts
or how a given law or property rights should be construed or applied in
a given case.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Hans-Hermann Hoppe, revered patron saint of flagpolism,
fundamentally rejects their entire method. He condemns the obsession
with “peripheral” and “far-fetched” hypotheticals that distract from
what truly matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All too often some libertarians lose sight of the fundamentally
important distinction between the core, the foundational principles of a
theory on the one hand and its application to various peripheral—often
far-fetched or merely fictional—practical problems […] Anything else
would be ultimately no more than idle mental exercises: deriving wildly
unrealistic conclusions from wildly unrealistic assumptions, i.e.,
examples of ‘garbage-in-and-garbage-out.’”<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The irony deepens, as many of these same dogmatists insist on
labeling themselves “Objectivists.” Yet Ayn Rand herself had no time for
such senseless context-dropping. She explicitly argued that the ethics
of an emergency are distinct from the ethics of normal life, and that
principles cannot be derived from “lifeboat scenarios”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is important to differentiate between the rules of conduct in an
emergency situation and the rules of conduct in the normal conditions of
human existence. This does not mean a double standard of morality: the
standard and the basic principles remain the same, but their application
to either case requires precise definitions.</p>
<p>An emergency is an unchosen, unexpected event, limited in time, that
creates conditions under which human survival is impossible […] In an
emergency situation, men’s primary goal is to combat the disaster,
escape the danger and restore normal conditions…”<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, then, plainly ridiculous to judge anyone’s ideological
commitment by their response to such a contrived hypothetical. But the
problem is more severe: most of these hypotheticals are not just lazy
thought experiment; they are deliberately constructed lose-lose
scenarios, logical traps from which no “principled” escape is
possible.</p>
<p>The flagpole dilemma, for instance, only functions by stripping out
the near-infinite variables of real life. Perhaps there is a safety net
below. Perhaps the building’s charter has an emergency-assistance clause
for residents. Perhaps the owner is a known trespasser himself, making
an estoppel claim possible. Maybe the person demanding you let go is not
even the rightful owner, but a burglar! The hypothetical demands a
binary answer to a situation that, in reality, would be a kaleidoscope
of legal and situational context. As we have seen, nothing exists in a
vacuum, so asking one to reason in one is entirely useless.</p>
<p>This refusal to engage with reality highlights the dogmatist’s most
appaling confusion. He takes a principle meant for the purity of theory
and attempts to apply it with suicidal rigidity to the messy,
compromised reality of an emergency. He fails to grasp a distinction
clear distinction which Hoppe mentions: the uncompromising nature of
theoretical truth is not a blueprint for every real-world action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[I]n theory, in thinking, compromise is impermissible. In everyday
life, compromise is a permanent, and ubiquitous, feature, of course. But
in theory, compromise is the ultimate sin, a strict and absolute ‘no
no.’ […] Either some proposition is true or it is false. There can be no
‘meeting in the middle’ of truth and falsehood.”<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life is overwhelmingly complex. In the face of an emergency, when
survival itself is at stake, a principled person may be forced to act in
a way that seems to compromise those principles. But this compromise in
action does not negate the validity of the principle in theory. It is
not a rejection of the principle, nor is it embracing relativism. It is
simply a recognition of a hard fact of reality which the dogmatist
willfully ignores.</p>
<p>The flagpole libertarian’s second mistake is to ignore the absurd
logic of his own proposed solution. By his own standard, the moment you
grabbed the flagpole, you violated the NAP and ceased to be a
“principled libertarian.” If this is the case, then there would exist no
reason for one to then also be <em>de</em> ceased. Your fall from grace
is already complete. If death could somehow restore your principled
status, why couldn’t the honorable act of surviving and paying full
restitution do the same? The logic only holds if our philosophy has
adopted the Bushido code of honor-suicide, and I simply missed the
memo.</p>
<p>Even if we were to accept this feudal honor code, where death
supposedly engraves “Libertarian” on your tombstone, the logic remains
flawed, as it ignores the practical implications of plummeting to one’s
own doom. Letting go of the flagpole can’t possibly guarantee a
consequence-free outcome unless you fall into a void. You will
inevitably land on <em>something</em>. You could crash on someone else’s
balcony, their roof, their car, their pet, <em>someone else</em> , or
even just splatter across the pavement at terminal velocity. In any of
these scenarios, you have still committed a final, gruesome aggression
against another’s property. Worse, you have littered their property with
your remains—a biohazard of bone, blood, and gray matter that someone
else must now pay to clean up.</p>
<p>Indeed, one could argue that the dilemma’s entire premise is flawed.
Is grabbing the pole truly an aggression? Or is it a cooperative act,
implicitly taken in the owner’s interest to prevent the far greater
violation of having his property turned into a gore video set? From this
perspective, holding on is the least invasive option for all parties.
The dogmatist, of course, cannot entertain such nuance; his world admits
no such thing as a lesser evil.</p>
<p>Either way, the flagpole dilemma is already contrived as a trap. By
the dogmatist’s own logic, your status as a libertarian is forfeit the
moment you grab the pole, and committing suicide by letting go only
compounds the aggression. The only truly logical and principled path is
the one that minimizes harm and allows for justice to be done. This
means surviving, incurring the lesser aggression, and making the victim
whole through restitution. After all, a dead man can pay no debts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this entire angels-on-a-pin debate is rendered moot by a
single, simple fact: the hypothetical requires us to imagine a world
devoid of basic human decency. In reality, the vast majority of people
would help. Once again, Kinsella perfectly captured the collision
between sterile theory and humane wisdom when he reminisced an evening
with the great Ralph Raico:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Years ago, in the Auburn Hotel bar during a Mises event, having
drinks and talking libertarian stuff with a bunch of fellow
Rothbardians–we were debating the tired old issue of “if a guy falls out
of his window and lands on your flagpole extending from your apartment,
do you have to let him crawl into your apartment or can you assert your
property rights and refuse, so that he would eventually fall to his
death?”</p>
<p>The ancaps were batting it around, as they do. Ralph Raico was there,
and had been listening mostly quietly. Then he finally commented,
<strong>“Are you people insane? Of course you have to let him come
inside.”</strong> We other libertarians paused for a second, and after a
moment, resumed our mostly pointless angels-on-a-pin dorm-room
bullsession.“<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="reclaiming-a-libertarianism-for-life">Reclaiming a
Libertarianism for Life</h1>
<p>At its core, libertarianism is a profoundly humanitarian philosophy.
It is concerned with life, property, and peace—the essential
preconditions for human flourishing. Its central project is to theorize
and discover the legal and social arrangements that minimize coercion
and violence. It is a philosophy of the “ought,” to be sure, but one
that must remain grounded in the world of the “is.” Our task, then, is
not merely to dream of a perfect world, but to find the most practical
and peaceful path to bridge the gap between the two.</p>
<p>The dogmatic stance of the flagpole libertarian stands in stark
opposition to this humane vision. It is a philosophy built on a category
error, fundamentally anti-praxeological in its denial of subjective
human action. It prioritizes an abstract and unattainable ideal over any
marginal improvement in the real world. It analyzes all of life through
a detached, binary lens, utterly disregarding context and complexity. It
is, in short, a death cult: a creed that declares abstract principle to
be more valuable than human life, and which demands martyrdom as the
only truly consistent act.</p>
<p>Much to my disappointment, this is not hyperbole. In recent
discussions, these so-called “NAPtists” have insisted that if a gun were
put to your head and you were forced to steal a penny, the only
principled choice would be to take the bullet. By this same logic, and
as mentioned earlier, they argue that a conscripted soldier deserves to
be murdered, as he is part of the State’s apparatus. One even went so
far as to claim that a policeman must not intervene to stop a rape,
because his very existence is funded by coercion, and to accept his help
would be to legitimize the State.</p>
<p>This perverse logic stems from a gross misreading of the
Non-Aggression Principle. They treat aggression not as a category of
action, but as a metaphysical stain attached to a person via impossibly
long causal chains. If you are paid by the State, you are an
aggressor—even if you never initiate force yourself. This is how they
justify murdering a policeman in his sleep, even one who only ever
pushed paper. Under this line of thinking, one could just as easily
justify the murder of a public school teacher, a social worker, or even
an ex-convict doing community service for a victimless crime.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the final stop of this subversion of libertarian ideology
is the station of atrocity. I have seen it lead one such dogmatist to
justify the Katyn massacre, arguing that the slaughtered Polish officers
were merely “State enforcers” who got what they deserved. This is the
dead end of their philosophy: a libertarianism that makes excuses for
Stalin. At this point, one must seriously question whether these people
are libertarians at all, or merely nihilists cloaking themselves in the
language of liberty to subvert it from within and ridicule it in the
public eye.</p>
<p>For our entire existence, we libertarians have fought against the
statist caricature that paints our philosophy as inhumane. An entire
intellectual tradition has been dedicated to proving, beyond doubt, that
a society built on liberty is a society of compassion and flourishing.
How deeply ironic, then, that after all this work, the most monstrous
caricatures of libertarianism are now being championed by libertarians
themselves. It would seem the old adage is true: our own worst enemies
are found within our own ranks.</p>
<p>We now find our movement besieged from within on two fronts. On one
side are the Gadsden-flag wavers who embrace State violence and racial
collectivism—we all know who they are. On the other are these modal,
flagpole libertarians, more concerned with playing the role of the
Pharisee than with building a freer world. They police the ideological
purity of a movement they seem to believe they own, trying to outcast
our greatest thinkers, while casting themselves as a libertarian
<em>übermensch</em> : a fantasy figure of the tax-evading, off-the-grid
homesteader, 3D-printing guns in a wilderness free of compromise.</p>
<p>I do not for a moment believe they practice what they preach. In
their rhetoric, a “true” libertarian pays no taxes. In reality, I have
watched more than one of them pay for a service like X Premium—sales tax
and all—using the very platform where they broadcast their impossible
purity. Their principles are voided by the same act they use to proclaim
them.</p>
<p>This Rambo-like posturing is absurd. They speak as if one can simply
abandon fiat for crypto, yet forget that the supermarket does not accept
Bitcoin for bread, and that almost no employer will pay your wage in
Ethereum. They fantasize about moving to a cabin in the woods, yet
ignore that the State will always come knocking—for its property taxes,
for occupying “public” land, for whatever pretext it needs. It is a
fantasy born of a willful historical amnesia, as if Waco and Ruby Ridge
never happened. And while this childish delusion may be entertaining, it
ceases to be harmless when its adherents mistake it for a serious
political strategy, and attempt to convince others this is the only
“real” libertarianism.</p>
<p>The final irony, of course, is their own hypocrisy. No one can meet
their impossible standard of purity, least of all themselves. Let us
take the strict libertarian definition of aggression—an uninvited
invasion or alteration of the physical integrity of another person’s
body [or property]<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>—, and try to apply it with full
dogmatism (like flagpole libertarians apply the NAP), then you run into
absurd scenarios that would <em>inevitably</em> render them into
“unprincipled libertarians.” To provide some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To spit on the grass in a private park would necessarily
constitute an ex ante aggression in the absence of a rule that allows
it.</p></li>
<li><p>To have smoke particles from your chimney, or pollen particles
from a flower in your backyard, enter your neighbor’s property—provided
they have easement for being the first occupant—, making him cough,
would necessarily constitute an ex ante aggression.</p></li>
<li><p>To go for a walk and bump into someone by accident or negligence
would necessarily constitute an ex ante aggression.</p></li>
<li><p>To be eating at a restaurant and to be forced to spit food on the
ground to prevent one from choking would constitute an ex ante
aggression in the absence of a rule that allows it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are not lifeboat scenarios; they are the unavoidable,
microscopic frictions of daily life. To judge a person’s principles on
their flawless, moment-to-moment adherence to the NAP is therefore not
just absurd; it is to demand a standard that no human can possibly meet.
It is a yardstick designed not for living men, but for automatons.
Humans do not act according to if-else statements.</p>
<p>When confronted with their own hypocrisy, the flagpole libertarian
predictably retreats into one of three self-defeating evasions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>“I would never get myself into that situation.”</strong>
An infantile fantasy of perfect foresight, denying human fallibility in
an unpredictable world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“It’s not aggression unless there is a rule that
prohibits it.”</strong> This inverts the very logic of property rights,
which assumes that permission is required for any uninvited physical
contact, not the other way around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“It wasn’t my intention to aggress.”</strong> A
convenient appeal to an irrelevant standard. Intent may mitigate
punishment when judging an action <em>ex post</em> , but it does not
erase the <em>ex ante</em> fact of an aggression. And if intent
<em>is</em> the standard, their entire case against someone acting under
duress collapses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, their philosophy is not a universalist one, but a selfish
doctrine of “freedom for me, but not for thee.” They have bastardized
libertarianism into a personal lifestyle cult, which they attempt to
impose on others through patronizing shame and armchair psychologizing.
Their imagined path to a free world is one of purification: a cleansing
of the “weak” who are unwilling to die for an abstraction, leaving a
post-statist paradise for the “true” believers. They believe that the
masses must be convinced—no matter how impossiblbe of a task that is<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>—, or that they must perish. Far
from being a political strategy; it is a deluded, pseudo-Nietzschean
gnostic fantasy.</p>
<p>We must reject this mindset utterly and at once. We must reclaim
libertarianism as the humane and rational philosophy it has always been.
We must insist on the integrity of our deontology and principles, but
equally on their wise application in the world as it is. Our task is not
to retreat into the purity of the “ought,” but to find the courage,
ideas and means to build a bridge to it from the reality of the “is”,
until they both converge. The flagpole libertarians are welcome to stay
behind in their hermetic boxes. The difficult, necessary work of liberty
is for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Reason must win over liturgy. Libertarianism is not a religion, and
it is most certainly not a death cult. If we fail to defend this
movement from its own internal decay, if we abandon the difficult path
to a freer world for the sterile comfort of dogma, if we allow the
flagpole libertarians to become the face of our cause—then we will have
done the statists’ work for them. The road to tyranny will be clear, and
we will be left to console ourselves with the purity of our own
irrelevance while we stare down the barrel of a gun.</p>
