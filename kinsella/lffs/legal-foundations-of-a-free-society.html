<h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>The question as to what is justice and what constitutes a just
society is as old as philosophy itself. Indeed, it arises in everyday
life even long before any systematic philosophizing is to begin.</p>
<p>All throughout intellectual history, one prominent answer to this
question has been to say that it is “might” that makes “right.” Or more
specifically: that what is right or wrong, just or unjust, is
unilaterally decreed by a State qua territorial monopolist of violence.
The self-contradictory nature of this “decisionist” position, i.e. of
“legal positivism,” comes to light once we ask its proponents for a
reason or evidence as to why we should believe the proposition that
“might makes right” to be true and correct. By virtue of providing any
such reason or evidence, however, and thus seeking—ultimately—unanimous
agreement regarding the validity of the proposition in question, any
such proponent implicitly acknowledges the presence of other reasonable
and sensible persons and, importantly, that the question of right or
wrong, true or not-true, then, is not a matter of “might” or “fiat,” but
a question to be decided on the basis of common reason and experience
instead. Yet reason and experience demonstrate, contrary to the
proponent’s initial claim, that “might does <em>not</em> make right.”
That “might is might” and “right is right,” but “no might can ever
<em>make</em> a right.”</p>
<p>Aside from the decisionism championed by legal positivists, the most
prominent answer in modern times to the question under consideration,
then, has come from so-called social-contracts theorists. According to
them, what is just or not is determined by the terms of a contract
concluded and agreed upon by all members of a society. — Yet this
solution opens more questions than it answers and ends in a tangle of
confusion. For one, no such contract has ever been concluded anywhere.
Yet in the absence of any such contract, would people still be able to
distinguish between right and wrong? Obviously, one would think so,
because otherwise they would not even be able to rightfully conclude
a—indeed any—valid contract. Put differently: there first must be a
contractor—a person—and then there must be something rightfully owned
and to be contracted by this person—private or personal property—before
there can ever be a valid contractual agreement. Thus, personhood and
private property logically—or more precisely: praxeologically—precede
contracts and contractual agreements; and hence, trying to construct a
theory of justice on the foundation of contracts is a fundamental
praxeological error.</p>
<p>Moreover, with personhood and private property as the praxeological
foundation of contracts, then, any universal, all-encompassing and
-including social contract as imagined by social-contract theorists is
impossible. Rather: on this basis, all contracts are contracts between
identifiable and enumerable persons and concerning identifiable and
enumerable things or matters. No contract can bind anyone other than the
actual contractors, and no contract can concern things or matters other
than those specified in the contract. Accordingly: Real persons with
their various real, separate and exclusive properties simply
<em>cannot—praxeologically</em> cannot—conclude a contract as fancied by
social contract theorists.</p>
<p>For such a contract to be conceivable, a “new person” must be
invented. A fictitious person, that can do what no real person can! This
“new person,” invented for the purpose by social contract theorists,
then, is invariably some wildly unrealistic, severely “dis-embodied”
entity, i.e., a person without any bodily needs or appetites; “pure”
reason, if you will, freed from all constraints of time and place. — The
theorists then ask what arrangement of the world such persons would
agree on as just. And they then spin out an answer as to what they
believe this agreement between such entities to be, and why. — Any such
answer, however, whatever it may be, is always arbitrary, because the
only thing that can possibly be known about fictitious people and an
agreement among them is whatever has already been invested in such
beings from the very outset, per assumption. Indeed, as John Rawls, the
most celebrated modern social contract theorist, has admitted with
captivating frankness, he had simply “define(d) the original position
[of fictitious people placed behind a ‘veil of ignorance,’ <em>HHH</em>]
so that we get the desired solution.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> While the results that
Rawls gets from his assumptions concerning the original position agree
largely with the political views of the social democratic left, other
social contract theorists, with different assumptions about the original
meeting-of-the-minds, such as James M. Buchanan and his fictitious
constructs of “conceptual contracts” and “quasi-unanimity,” for
instance, have proposed answers more closely associated with the
political right. Still other theorists have presented yet other results.
Demonstrating, then, that the intellectual endeavors of social contract
theorists, however ambitious and sophisticated they may appear, are
ultimately no more than idle mental exercises: deriving wildly
unrealistic conclusions from wildly unrealistic assumptions, i.e.,
examples of “garbage-in-and-garbage-out.”</p>
<p>But there is another, more sinister aspect to the idea of a social
contract that comes to light once anyone of the various contractual
agreements as fancied by social contract theorists is actually put to
the test, implemented and enforced. Because implementing and enforcing
the terms of a contract that no real person had or could have agreed on
means, in effect, that all <em>real</em> contracts between <em>real</em>
people are superseded and replaced by the terms of some alleged
agreement among fictitious people as the ultimate judge in matters of
right and wrong. The word “contract,” then, with its positive
connotations, is used by social contract theorists to advance a program
that is actually destructive of all contracts. They declare
non-contracts and non-agreements to be contracts and agreements and
contracts and agreements to be non-contracts and non-agreements. — Thus,
ultimately, social contract theory turns out barely less arbitrary than
the decisionism of legal positivists. For its proponents, the question
of right or wrong may not be considered a matter of mere decree as for
some strict positivists. Instead, for them, it is the intuitions and
fancies of some philosophers that are supposed to do the job. But this
is hardly less arbitrary, one would think! And, of course, since no real
person had or could have agreed to any so-called social contract, its
enforcement then always requires an agency not itself founded on
agreement and contract but on disagreement, violence and coercion
instead: a State. And just like legal positivists, then, social contract
theorists invariably turn out to be statists, too, assigning and
entrusting the role of the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong to the
State qua territorial monopolist of violence.</p>
<p>Another popular answer to the question under consideration is that of
utilitarianism. Utilitarians essentially contend that the very rules
that maximize or promise to maximize total social utility or bring about
the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people are and should
be considered just. Apart from other difficulties connected with its
consequentialism, however, this answer can be quickly dismissed as
fatally flawed for the simple reason that there exist no units of
utility or happiness, and hence, that any interpersonal comparison of
utility or happiness and any aggregation of individual utility or
happiness to “social utility” or “social happiness” must be considered
impossible (or, if still invoked, as entirely arbitrary).</p>
<p>With the answers of legal positivists, social contract theorists and
utilitarians all rejected as fundamentally flawed, however popular they
may be, the only remaining answer, then, comes from the old, pre-modern
intellectual tradition of natural law and natural rights. It is also in
this nowadays rather unfashionable intellectual tradition, broadly
conceived, that Stephan Kinsella’s here presented work must be
placed.</p>
<p>Natural law and rights theorists contend that the principles of just
human conduct can be discovered from the study of human nature. On the
one hand, such study reveals that humans are endowed with
<em>reason</em>, as manifested by the indisputable fact that they can
speak and communicate with one another, from person to person, in a
common language. On the other hand, this study shows that humans are
also <em>actors</em> (and in combination then: <em>reasonable
actors</em>). Speaking and communicating itself are purposeful
activities directed at a goal. Yet even if and when we are not speaking
or communicating but do things silently, we are still acting and cannot
but act as long as we are not asleep, comatose or dead.</p>
<p>Further, this study also reveals the “deep structure” of human
action, i.e. what all actions of all humans have in common. Every
individual actor (and only individuals act!), whatever he does, pursues
a goal or end the attainment of which he considers more satisfying than
the satisfaction to be expected from acting differently. Every actor is
thereby placed in a given environment, at a specific point in time and
space, with specific external surroundings of men and materials, and
equipped with his own nature-given bodily makeup and mental endowment;
and every action, then, whatever it may be, invariably aims to alter an
actor’s specific present situation to his personal advantage and greater
satisfaction. In any case, to reach his goals, whatever they may be, an
actor invariably must employ <em>means</em>. At a minimum, he must
employ his own physical body and brain (plus the body’s standing room)
as means for the attainment of some expected bodily or psychic gain, and
he must thereby use up some time that he also could have used
differently.</p>
<p>Generally, however, a person’s actions involve more than the
purposeful use of one’s physical body and mind. It involves also various
elements of the external world that, unlike a person’s own body, can
only be indirectly controlled by means of one’s directly controlled
body. Such elements of the external world that can be indirectly
controlled and manipulated by a person and that are recognized or
believed by an actor to be suitable for the attainment of his ends are
called <em>means</em>. Those elements of the external world beyond or
believed to be beyond human control on the other hand are referred to as
<em>external conditions</em> under which a person’s actions are to take
place. The choice of means employed by a person for the attainment of
his ends is always a matter of <em>ideas</em>, i.e. of reason and
reasoning. An actor always chooses such an allocation and arrangement of
means that he believes to bring about some desired result. The choice of
means is validated by their result. A person’s actions then are always
guided by some ideas about cause and effect: performing A, B and C will
lead to X, Y and Z. But man is not infallible and a person’s ideas
concerning cause and effect or the interconnectedness and regularity of
events may be false, and a person’s action based on these ideas then
will lead to failure rather than the anticipated success, inducing the
person to learn, i.e. to revisit and possibly revise his original
ideas.</p>
<p>Given this insight into the general human condition, it becomes
immediately clear what a human ethic or a theory of justice worth its
salt must accomplish. It must give an answer to the question of what am
I and what is every other person permitted (or not permitted) to do,
right now and right here, wherever a person may find himself and
whatever his external surroundings of men and materials may be. More
specifically, what is a person permitted (or not permitted) to do in an
interaction with another person? And: what external entities is a person
permitted (or not permitted) to bring under his control to be used as
means toward his personal ends?</p>
<p>Because no person can ever <em>stop</em> acting, from his beginnings
as a person until his very end (except when asleep, comatose or dead),
these questions arise again and again, without end, for everyone,
wherever and whenever he may find himself and must act. Obviously, then,
an answer to pressing questions such as these cannot wait for the
establishment of the institution of a State, the conclusion of a
contract (which would actually have to <em>presuppose</em> a valid
answer to these very questions in order to make it a <em>valid</em>
contract) or the arrival of some future consequences.<br />
Instead, the answer must be discoverable and recognizable from the very
outset, from the first, immediate insight into the nature of man as a
<em>reasonable actor</em>. And indeed, this is so once the purpose, the
ultimate end, of all reason and reasoning is recognized and
acknowledged. As already noted, human reason is manifested in the
indisputable fact that one person can <em>communicate</em> with another
person in a <em>common</em> language (and different languages are
inter-translatable). The purpose of speaking and communicating with one
another, then, even if and when expressing one’s disagreement with
another person’s say-so in meaningful words, is to guide or coordinate
the actions of different persons by words or meaningful symbols alone.
This endeavor may succeed and words help guide or coordinate the actions
of different persons to mutual satisfaction. Or the endeavor may fail.
But in any case, the goal of speaking and communicating is always and
invariably the same: to maintain peace and seek peaceful cooperation or
coexistence—and in reverse: to <em>avoid conflict</em>, i.e., physical
clashes or conflagrations of people that are destined to result whenever
and wherever two or more people pursue their own different goals with
the help of one and the same person’s body or one and the same
indirectly controlled or controllable external means of action at the
same time.</p>
<p>The objective for a human ethic or a theory of justice, then, is the
discovery of such rules of human conduct that make it possible for
a—indeed, any—bodily person to act—indeed, to live his entire active
life—in a world made up of different people, a “given” external,
material environment, and various scarce—rivalrous, contestable or
conflict-<br />
able—material objects useable as means toward a person’s ends, without
ever running into physical clashes with anybody else.</p>
<p>Essentially, these rules have been known and recognized since
eternity. They consist of three principal components. First,
<em>personhood</em> and <em>self-ownership</em>: Each person
owns—exclusively controls—his physical body that only he and no one else
can control <em>directly</em> (any control over another person’s body,
by contrast, is invariably an <em>in-direct</em> control, presupposing
the prior direct control of one’s own body). Otherwise, if
body-ownership were assigned to some indirect body-controller, conflict
would become unavoidable as the direct body-controller <em>cannot</em>
give up the direct control over his body as long as he is alive.
Accordingly, any physical interference with another person’s body must
be consensual, invited and agreed to by such a person, and any
non-consensual interference with his body constitutes an unjust and
prohibited invasion.</p>
<p>Second, <em>private property</em> and <em>original
appropriation</em>: Logically, what is required to avoid all conflict
regarding external material objects used or usable as means of action,
i.e. as goods, is clear: every good must always and at all times be
owned privately, i.e. controlled exclusively by some specified person.
The purposes of different actors then may be as different as can be, and
yet no conflict will arise so long as their respective actions involve
exclusively the use of their own private property. And how can external
objects become private property in the first place without leading to
conflict? To avoid conflict from the very start, it is necessary that
private property be founded through <em>acts of original
appropriation</em>, because only through <em>actions</em>, taking place
in time and space, can an objective—intersubjectively ascertainable—link
be established between a particular person and a particular object. And
only the <em>first</em> appropriator of a previously unappropriated
thing can acquire this thing as his property <em>without conflict</em>.
For, by definition, as the <em>first</em> appropriator he
<em>cannot</em> have run into conflict with anyone else in appropriating
the good in question, as everyone else appeared on the scene only
<em>later</em>. Otherwise, if exclusive control is assigned instead to
some <em>late-comers</em>, conflict is not avoided but contrary to the
very purpose of reason made unavoidable and permanent.</p>
<p>Third, <em>exchange</em> and <em>contract</em>: Other than per
original appropriation, property can only be acquired by means of a
voluntary—mutually agreed upon—exchange of property from some previous
owner to some later owner. This transfer of property from a prior to a
later owner can either take the form of a direct or “spot” exchange,
which may be bi- or multi-lateral as when someone’s apples are exchanged
for another’s oranges, or it may be unilateral as when a person makes a
gift to someone else or when someone pays another person with his
property now, on the spot, in the expectation of some future services on
the part of the recipient. Or else the transfer of property can take the
form of contracts concerning not just present but in particular also
prospective, future-dated transfers of property titles. These
contractual transfers of property titles can be unconditional or
conditional transfers, and they too can involve bi- or multi-lateral as
well as unilateral property transfers. Any acquisition of property other
than through original appropriation or voluntary or contractual exchange
and transfer from a previous to a later owner is unjust and prohibited
by reason. (Of course, in addition to these normal property acquisition
rules, property can also be transferred from an aggressor to his victim
as rectification for a previous trespass committed.)</p>
<p>Drawing on the long, but in today’s world largely forgotten or
neglected, intellectual tradition of natural law and natural rights
theory with its three just briefly sketched principal components, then,
the most elaborate, systematic, rigorous and lucid presentation of a
theory of justice up until then had been developed in the course of the
second half of the 20th century by economist-philosopher Murray N.
Rothbard, culminating in his <em>Ethics of Liberty</em>, originally
published in 1982. Unfortunately, but not entirely surprisingly,
however, his work was typically either completely ignored or else
dismissed out of hand by the gatekeepers and high priests of academia.
The anarchist conclusions ultimately arrived at by Rothbard in his works
appeared simply outlandish in an ideological environment molded
overwhelmingly by tax-funded intellectuals and steeped to the hip in
statism or <em>étatisme</em>. Among academic big shots, only Harvard
philosopher Robert Nozick in his <em>Anarchy, State and Utopia</em>
acknowledged his intellectual debt to Rothbard and seriously tried to
refute his anarchist conclusions—but miserably failed.</p>
<p>While Rothbard’s work largely fell on deaf ears within academia,
then, it exerted considerable influence outside of it, in the public at
large. Indeed, through his work Rothbard became the founder of the
modern libertarian movement, attracting a sizable popular following far
exceeding that of any mainstream academic in numbers. As for the further
development of a natural-law and -rights based theory of justice,
however, this very success turned out to be a rather mixed blessing. On
the one hand, the movement inspired by Rothbard likely helped dampen and
slow down the popularity and growth of statism, but it manifestly failed
in halting or even reversing the long-run historical trend toward ever
increasing state power. On the other hand (and that may well be one of
the reasons for this failure), the larger the movement grew in numbers,
the greater also the confusion and the number of intellectual errors
spread and committed by its followers. The pure theory of justice as
presented by Rothbard was increasingly watered down, misunderstood,
misinterpreted or downright falsified, whether for short-run tactical
gains, out of ignorance or plain cowardice. As well, all too often sight
was lost of the fundamentally important distinction between the core,
the foundational principles of a theory on the one hand and its
application to various peripheral—often far-fetched or merely
fictional—practical problems on the other; and far too much effort and
time, then, has been spent on debating peripheral issues the solution of
which may well be arguable, but which is of minor importance in the
larger scheme of things and helps distract public attention and
concentration away from those questions and issues that truly matter and
count.</p>
<p>In this situation, then, more than 40 years after the first
publication of Rothbard’s <em>Ethics of Liberty</em> and characterized
by much practical disappointment and increasing theoretical confusion,
the publication of Stephan Kinsella’s present work must be considered a
most welcome sign of renewed hope and new, refreshing intellectual
inspiration.<br />
Indeed, with this work, that has been in the making for more than two
decades, Kinsella has produced no less than an intellectual landmark,
establishing himself as the leading legal theorist and the foremost
libertarian thinker of his generation. While following in Rothbard’s
footsteps, Kinsella’s work does not merely rehash what has been said or
written before. Rather, having absorbed as well all of the relevant
literature that has appeared during the last few decades since
Rothbard’s passing, Kinsella in the following offers some fresh
perspectives and an innovative approach to the age-old quest for
justice, and he adds several highly significant refinements and
improvements and some centrally important new insights to the theories
of personhood, property and contract, most famously some radical
criticism and rejection of the idea of “intellectual property” and
“intellectual property rights.”</p>
<p>Henceforth, then, all essential studies in the philosophy of law and
the field of legal theory will have to take full account of the theories
and criticisms expounded by Kinsella.</p>
<p>Hans-Hermann Hoppe</p>
<p>Istanbul, May 2023</p>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>The issue of what property rights we have, or should have, what laws
are just and proper, has long confronted mankind, and continues to be
the subject of debate today. This book seeks to address these issues,
with an approach that keeps in mind the nature and reality of human
life—that we are purposeful human actors living in a world of scarcity
and facing the possibility of interpersonal conflict—and the purpose of
law and property norms: to enable us to live together, in society,
peacefully and cooperatively. The goal is to vindicate the private law
as developed in the decentralized systems of the Roman and common law,
with an emphasis on consistency, principle, and the inviolable rights of
the individual. In short, to argue for a private law system informed by
libertarian principles.</p>
<p>Thus, in these pages, I try to explain what libertarianism
<em>is</em>, why individual self-ownership and property rights are
justified, how the law ought to deal with criminals and tortfeasors, how
property rights should be understood so that errors such as intellectual
property (IP), taxes, and the drug war can be exposed, and, finally why
a consistent libertarianism implies that a stateless society, sometimes
called anarchy, offers the best hope for a free and just social order. I
explore the nature of law and legislation, and subject various aspects
of positive law, as well as other theories of law, including that of
other libertarians, to criticism and appraisal.</p>
<p>These arguments are premised on the thesis that just law is anchored
in core principles of self-ownership plus ownership of external scarce
resources as governed by principles of original appropriation,
contractual title transfer, and rectification. The developed legal
system of an advanced, free society is the detailed working out of the
implications and applications of these basic principles to various
practical and recurring situations in human interactions. This book
looks from numerous angles at why these principles are important and how
adhering to them consistently can help us achieve a freer society and
adjudge the legitimacy of concrete laws and legal systems.</p>
<p>As to how this book came about: I’ve been intensely interested
in—some might say obsessed with—libertarian ideas for over forty years,
since high school. It has become a life passion and an avocation of
sorts. A calling, though not a career.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
After starting, as so many libertarians of my generation have, with the
ideas of Ayn Rand,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I soon discovered the work of
Austrian economists and anarcho-libertarians, such as Ludwig von Mises,
Murray Rothbard, and Hans-Hermann Hoppe, whose ideas are my greatest
influence.</p>
<p>I started publishing on matters of libertarian theory in 1992, fresh
out of law school.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I tried to use my knowledge of the
law—both the English common law and the Roman law, as embodied in the
civil law of most European countries and my own home state,
Louisiana—and Austrian economics and libertarian principles, to advance
libertarian theory where I thought I could contribute. I first wrote on
rights and punishment theory in the early 1990s (see chapters 5 and 22),
and then on related areas like legislation (chapter 13), contract and
inalienability theory (chapters 9 and 10), and so on. In 2001, I
published “Against Intellectual Property,”<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
which was controversial and influential, so I’ve become known by many
libertarians primarily for my IP arguments. As the essays in the current
volume illustrate, however, IP is not my sole area of interest. My
interest in and passion for libertarian ideas has always been driven by
my love of philosophy, truth, justice, logic, consistency, and
economics. This book includes several chapters on IP but also covers
other aspects of libertarian legal theory, such as rights theory and
others noted above.</p>
<p>By 2010 or so, most of the theory-laden articles that became the
chapters in this book had been published, so around that time I thought
of collecting some of these articles in a single book, since they
covered a large and complementary number of interrelated topics, such as
rights and punishment theory, contract theory, causation and
responsibility, intellectual property, anarchy, legislation, and so on.
But I kept putting the project off. I felt I was missing some material
that should be in such a book, such as a general overview of
libertarianism itself, and an update of the intellectual property
material I had initially published in 2001. I eventually wrote these
articles (now chapters 2, 14, and 15), so I felt it was time to finally
assemble and complete this book.</p>
<p>The twenty-five chapters are based on articles published over an
almost thirty-year period, from 1994 to 2022, with one chapter (15)
being formally published for the first time here (2023). I decided to
omit some articles I had published before, as they are a bit too focused
on American-specific issues like the US Constitution, federalism, and so
on, and also for space reasons.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I also did not include
any purely legal publications—those related to my vocation, not my
avocation—such as those found at my legal website www.KinsellaLaw.com. I
included only writing having to do with libertarian issues.</p>
<p>Most of these articles were published in scholarly journals or in
online publications. A few chapters are more conversational in tone, as
they were based on interviews or transcripts of speeches (e.g. chapters
17 and 23–25). Even with these, I have added extensive references and
cross-references where appropriate.</p>
<p>I divided the book into six sections. Part I—Libertarianism covers my
own introduction to libertarianism, an overview of libertarianism, and
my take on anarchism. Part II—Rights concerns arguments for
self-ownership, property rights, and punishment theory. Part
III—Libertarian Legal Theory has chapters building on the theory in
previous chapters to apply to various laws and libertarian issues, like
causation and responsibility (chapter 8), contract and inalienability
theory (chapters 9–11), and a long chapter on the pitfalls of
legislation as a way of making law (chapter 13) (I probably should have
turned this one into a PhD dissertation…).</p>
<p>Part IV—Intellectual Property contains a chapter presenting the basic
case against IP (chapter 14), basically a streamlined and somewhat
updated version of <em>AIP</em>, followed by chapter 15, which
summarizes other IP arguments and issues that I wrote and spoke on after
<em>AIP</em>. I also include some of my discussion with, and commentary
on the views of, my pro-IP libertarian friend, the late J. Neil
Schulman, and a piece on the nature of scarce and nonscarce goods, which
is relevant to the IP issue.</p>
<p>Part V—Reviews contains four book reviews or review essays providing
libertarian commentary on various books on law or political philosophy.
Finally, Part VI—Interviews &amp; Speeches is less formal and contains
two interviews and a speech assessing the last five or six decades of
the libertarian movement.</p>
<p>For those who want to skip the more extraneous material and focus on
the core libertarian theory chapters, I recommend chapters
<strong>2–12</strong>, <strong>14–15</strong>, and
<strong>18</strong>.</p>
<p>I have revised all the material in the book, which was required since
many of the original articles used different citation formats and also
because some of my thinking and terminology has changed over the years.
Several chapters are significantly revised or expanded, which in a few
cases led to very long footnotes, since it would have been too
disruptive to rewrite the article to integrate the extra commentary into
the text; in some cases I moved very long footnotes to an appendix.</p>
<p>Although the chapters were all written separately and at different
times over three decades, many of them build on (or anticipated) others.
For example, in chapter 10, originally published 1998–99, I outlined a
sketch of a view of contracts, inalienability, and so on (note 48), and
wrote “Elaboration of these ideas will have to await a subsequent
article.” I did so in 2003, in the article which became chapter 9. Thus,
I was able to piece together several articles in a fairly systematic
form since they either built on or anticipated each other and were
written to be consistent with each other and all flowing from the same
core principles and reasoning.</p>
<p>I have added extensive cross-references pointing to related
discussion in other chapters. There is a bit of redundancy in some of
the chapters since they were published independently. However, it is my
view that the repetition that does exist in some articles can help
reinforce a given argument or idea or show it from a different
angle.</p>
<p>In one case I now disagree with something I originally wrote; I
retained the original text and added an explanatory note (chapter 13,
Part III.C). And in chapter 9 (Part III.C), I note that, regarding my
earlier criticism of Rothbard’s argument for inalienability: “I now
think it is possible that his approach is more compatible with my own
than I originally realized.” But otherwise, I today still stand by most
of the original content of those articles, in terms of substance.
However, as noted several places in the text, I often now use
terminology somewhat differently, e.g., the term <em>state</em> instead
of <em>government</em>; <em>rivalrous</em> or <em>“conflictable”</em>
instead of <em>scarce</em>; using the word <em>property</em> to refer to
the relation between humans with respect to owned resources, instead of
referring to the owned resource itself, and so on. I have in some cases
updated the text to my current, preferred usage, but not always since it
would have been too drastic and tedious.</p>
<p>I have also included a table of contents for some of the chapters
where I thought it would be useful. And as noted above, in several
chapters I moved very long footnotes to an appendix.</p>
<p>I have tried to conform references to a more or less uniform citation
style of my own preference (a modified version of Chicago style),
although my main goal was to simply provide sufficient information for
the reader to locate the cited work, not to conform to some arbitrary
format (and also not to obsess over consistency). In this, I am
influenced by the citation policy of the second incarnation of the legal
journal <em>The Greenbag</em>: “Citations should be accurate, complete,
and unobtrusive. Familiar sources need no citation. Authors may use
whatever citation form they prefer; we will make changes only to keep
footnotes from looking like goulash.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>I have also included hyperlinks for online versions of cited material
where possible. If we lived in a copyright-free world, everything would
be online and readers could easily find any cited work with a search.
Alas. For my own work that I reference, since it is mostly available on
my own website, I provide an initial hyperlink in the title but do not
type out the URL in the text. Almost all of my work referenced in the
text can be found at www.StephanKinsella.com/publications,<br />
www.StephanKinsella.com/lffs, or www.c4sif.org. I have liberally used
permalinks via www.perma.cc in cases where I suspected future possible
linkrot or where the original URL is overlong.</p>
<p>I debated various titles for this work. Titles like <em>Freedom and
the Law</em> and <em>Liberty and Law</em> were already taken.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I considered at one time calling
this work <em>The Ethics of Action</em>, as an amalgamation and nod to
similar titles by other authors<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and to evoke a recurring
theme in my writing: an exploration of the ethics that guide action and
of ethics implied by certain classes of action (see the argumentation
ethics and estoppel theory of rights I advance in chapters 5 and 6). But
in the end, this seemed too inscrutable and only applicable to a small
part of this book’s content, so for years I planned on using the title
<em>Law in a Libertarian World: Legal Foundations of a Free
Society</em>. In the end, some trusted colleagues urged me to drop the
main title and use the subtitle instead. I have.</p>
<p>The length of the book turned out to be larger than expected, but I
have chosen to publish this book as one volume instead of breaking it
into two. I think this will be easier for the reader, given the
extensive cross-references between chapters, and should make for a lower
cost. My goal was never sales. It was only to help advance libertarian
theory by making these thoughts accessible to whoever might be
interested now or in the future. Thus, in addition to print (both hard
and softcover) and ebook versions for sale on major platforms, I am of
course posting<br />
a free digital version online at www.StephanKinsella.com/lffs, and with
a Creative Commons Zero license. Anyone is free to republish this work,
or translate it, or make audio versions, without asking my

<p>I have published in the past with various publishing houses, such as
the Mises Institute, Oceana Publications, Oxford University Press, and
so on, but for this book I have decided to self publish, under my own
imprint, Papinian Press (www.PapinianPress.com), for a variety of
reasons. First, my own procrastination has delayed this project for over
a decade, so I was reluctant to add yet another year to this project by
engaging a normal publisher. Second, I saw no benefit to using a
mainstream publisher. I do not need their delays or “helpful
suggestions,” which would no doubt urge me to water down my arguments or
make them more mainstream. No, thank you. And I have no career or
academic ambitions to burnish by using a prestigious press. Also, I
wanted freedom to release this book totally open source, free of any
copyright restrictions, and to post free online versions, which most
publishers would balk at. I’m frankly tired of the dinosaur legacy
publishing industry. Finally, I may use the Papinian Press imprint for
future book projects, so am glad to use this book to kick it off.</p>
<p>The imprint, by the way, is named after the third-century Roman
jurist Papinian (Aemilius Papinianus), who also adorned the
advertisement for my 2011 Mises Academy course on libertarian legal
theory.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The reason I admire Papinian, in
addition to his being a great jurist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Papinian is said to have been put to death for refusing to compose a
justification of Caracalla’s murder of his brother and co-Emperor, Geta,
declaring, so the story goes, that “it is easier to commit murder than
to justify it.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Papinian bravely chose death in the name of justice; and his
formulation <em>“it is easier to commit murder than to justify it”</em>
brilliantly encapsulates the distinction between <em>committing</em> an
action and normatively <em>justifying</em> the action. It emphasizes the
importance of justifying interpersonal violence, and the difference
between description and prescription, between fact and value, between is
and ought—insights which play a crucial role in my own defenses of
rights (see chapters 5–7).</p>
<p>Although this book is written in English, many of the articles from
which it derives have been translated into other languages, and some
have audio versions available. They are online at
www.StephanKinsella.com/translations and
www.StephanKinsella.com/media.</p>
<p>I refer readers to www.StephanKinsella.com/lffs for errata, links to
my own publications referenced in the book, and for supplementary
material.</p>
<p>It is my hope that readers and future scholars will benefit from the
arguments offered in these pages.</p>

<h1 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>As noted in the Preface, I’ve been intensely involved in
libertarianism for over forty years and, for almost thirty years, with
the Mises Institute. I’ve been fortunate to have learned from thinkers
from the past such as Rothbard, Mises, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman,
Frederic Bastiat, and many others,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> but also from
countless friends, mentors, colleagues, co-authors, acquaintances,
interlocutors, discussants, and so on over the last forty years. It
would be impossible to try to thank them all by name. Nonetheless I
would like to try to express my appreciation for some special people and
groups that have meant so much to me. I apologize in advance for those I
have inadvertently omitted.</p>
<p>First and foremost, to my wife of thirty years, Cindy, and to all my
close friends and family, for tolerating my libertarian obsessions and
libertarian macho flashes for decades, and for listening to me argue,
explain, and explore ideas.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> To my son Ethan, to
whom this book is dedicated, for inspiring me and enriching my life, and
for also loving liberty and goodness. And to my trainer and friend,
Stephanie Rakoczy, for letting me vent about all matters libertarian for
many years now in between squats and pushups. I am grateful to my birth
mother, Gail Doiron McGehee, for blessing me with my adoptive parents;
to my mom for taking me to the library as much as I wanted; to my dad
for driving me to school so far away in another parish for so many
years; and to Mrs. Reinhardt, a librarian at Catholic High School in
Baton Rouge, for recommending that I read <em>The Fountainhead</em>.</p>
<p>This book would not be possible without the understanding of property
rights I’ve arrived at, and this in turn would not be possible without
the work of Hans-Hermann Hoppe, whom I have also been fortunate to call
a close friend. His support, friendship, guidance, and example of
personal and intellectual integrity over the years mean more to me than
I can properly express. My life would not be the same, nor this book
possible, without him.</p>
<p>I’ve had a host of libertarian friends and friend groups that I’ve
learned and benefitted from, or had support from, over the years,
including my longtime friend Jack Criss, Jr.; the “Las Vegas
crew”—former students of Rothbard and Hoppe, and now my good friends:
Doug French (and Deanna Forbush), Jeff Barr, Lee Iglody, Jim Yohe, Joe
Becker; others such as Juan Fernando Carpio; Greg and Joy Morin; Konrad
Graf, Michael Conaghan, Jacob Huebert, Gene Healy, Gary Chartier, Gerard
Casey, Richard Storey, Tom Woods, Michael Malice, Bob Murphy, Roderick
Long, Jan Narveson, Frank van Dun, Robert Bradley, Jr.; Gil Guillory,
Paul Edwards, Jacob Lovell, Rob Wicks, Greg Rome, Brian Martinez, Dick
Clark, Isaac Bergman, Daniel Coleman, Timo Virkkala, and many others in
my “Libertarian Forum” crowd (you know who you are); James Cox and
Daniel Rothschild; many friends and scholars from the Property and
Freedom Society and from countless Mises Institute events and
conferences since 1995, including Lew Rockwell, David Gordon, Tom
DiLorenzo, Peter Klein, Jeff Herbener, Joe Salerno, Sean Gabb, and
others; correspondents from years ago such as Johan Ridenfeldt and Chris
Whitten; co-authors and friends such as Patrick Tinsley, Jeff Tucker,
and Walter Block, the first two of whom co-authored chapters with me in
this volume. Thanks also to Nelson Loftin, for nudging me over several
years to complete this book.</p>
<p>My dear friend Guido Hülsmann, whom I met on a bus from the Atlanta
airport to the Mises Institute in Auburn in 1995 when we were both going
there to meet Hans-Hermann Hoppe, has been an important friend and
influence, both personally and intellectually. My friend Wendy McElroy
has also been an inspiration and sounding board and helped me see the
light on IP.</p>
<p>The notes for various chapters in this book also thank various
commentators.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Randy Barnett, and several LSU law
professors, such as Saúl Litvinoff, Glenn Morris, William Hawkland,
Alain Levasseur, Robert Pascal, and John Devlin, for inspiration,
support, and guidance in my earlier years in law school and in the
beginning years of my legal practice and scholarly and educational
endeavors (Litvinoff and Pascal were not my professors but they became
friends and correspondents after law school). I learned a great deal at
the LSE about international law and legal scholarship from professor and
now Baroness Rosalyn Higgins, later President of the International Court
of Justice; she inspired and informed much of my subsequent legal
publications on international law.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to my intellectual adversaries, who have forced me
to hone, refine, and clarify my arguments to counter and explain the
errors in theirs.</p>
<p>P.J. Doland, a fellow libertarian and web-designer with
www.DancingMammoth.com, has graciously hosted and helped me run my own
websites and others I manage over the years, all in the service of
liberty, which were invaluable in collecting, publishing, and assembling
material used in the preparation of this book. Since I haltingly started
this book project about fifteen years ago, I’ve had the assistance of
several people, including Lisa Eldridge and Rosemary Denshaw
(transcriptions); Justina Clark, Harry David, Lauren Barlow, and Carly
Catt (copyediting); Susi Clark, of www.creativeblueprintdesign.com, for
cover design, typesetting and publishing assistance; and Susan Bruck
(proofreading, indexing, and bibliography).</p>
<p>The image on the back cover of the book is based on a painting by my
childhood friend John Wax, of www.JohnWaxArt.com, which itself was based
on photographs of a statue by H.C. Andersen.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
To get permission and arrange a private photographer at the Andersen
Musuem in Rome, I was fortunate to have the help of my Italian
libertarian friend and scholar, Roberta Modugno, and my Italian-speaking
Canadian libertarian attorney friend Daniel Roncari.</p>
<p>To all these, and many others not mentioned, I am grateful.</p>

Libertarian</h3>
<p>First published as part of the <em>LewRockwell.com</em> autobiography
series initiated by Walter Block, as “How I Became A Libertarian,”
<em>LewRockwell.com</em> (December 18, 2002). Later included as “Being a
Libertarian” in <em>I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary
Libertarians</em> (compiled by Walter Block; Mises Institute 2010).

www.stephankinsella.com/publications/#biographical.</p>
<p>Unlike many libertarians who dally with socialism before seeing the
light, I have never been attracted to leftism. Indeed, although I of
course welcome former pinkos to our ranks, I’m always a bit suspicious
of anyone who could ever be swayed by that bunk.</p>
<p>Born in 1965, I was reared in a small town near Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. My natural aversion to leftism stems from this upbringing.
The milieu—if South Louisiana can be said to have one—was nominally
Democratic, but relatively apolitical, culturally conservative, and
Catholic. I can’t recall ever meeting any open or hardcore leftists
until college.</p>
<p>There were other contributing factors that made me ripe for
libertarianism. For one, I have always been strongly individualistic and
merit-oriented. This is probably because I was adopted and thus have
always tended to cavalierly dismiss the importance of “blood ties” and
any inherited or “unearned” group characteristics. This made me an ideal
candidate to be enthralled by Ayn Rand’s master-of-universe “I don’t
need anything from you or owe you anything” themes.</p>
<p>Another factor is my strong sense of outrage at injustice, which
probably developed as a result of my hatred of bullies and bullying. I
was frequently attacked by them as a kid, because I was small for my
age, bookish, and a smartass. Not a good combination.</p>
<p>I attended Catholic elementary and high school in Baton Rouge. I had
a love-hate relationship with Mrs. Reinhardt, Catholic High School’s
librarian. When she was not expelling me and my cronies from the library
for pulling pranks, she would recommend books to me, as she knew I was
an avid reader of both fiction and nonfiction. One day she recommended
Ayn Rand’s <em>The Fountainhead</em> to me.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
(I believe this was in 1982, when I was a junior in high school—the same
year Rand died.)</p>
<p>“Read this. You’ll like it,” she told me. <em>Ex
nihilo</em>—something. Rand’s ruthless logic of justice appealed to me.
I was thrilled to see a more-or-less rigorous application of reason to
fields outside the natural sciences. I think this helped me to avoid
succumbing, in college, to the simplistic and naïve empiricism-scientism
that most of my fellow engineering classmates naturally absorbed.
Mises’s dualistic epistemology and criticism of
monism-positivism-empiricism, which I studied much later, also helped
shield me from scientism.</p>
<p>By my first year of college (1983), where I studied electrical
engineering, I was a fairly avid “Objectivist” style libertarian. I had
read Henry Hazlitt’s <em>Economics in One Lesson</em><a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
and some of Milton Friedman’s works, but I initially steered clear of
“libertarian” writing. Since Rand was so right on so many things, I at
first assumed she—and her disciples Peter Schwartz and Leonard
Peikoff—must be right in denouncing libertarianism as the enemy of
liberty.</p>
<p>And yet in my reading I kept coming across libertarians, whose views
seemed virtually identical to Rand’s “capitalist” politics. Finally, out
of exasperation at trying to reconcile Rand’s denunciation of
libertarians with their seemingly similar views, I read Rothbard’s
<em>For a New Liberty</em>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> and then several other
works, such as Nozick, the Tannehills, David Friedman, etc.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Before long I realized Rand’s
minarchism was flawed. Individual rights entail anarcho-capitalism; a
state, even a minarchist one, necessarily violates the individual rights
that Rand so passionately championed. Rand made a lot of sense on a lot
of issues, but her arguments in favor of government were strained.</p>
<p>I remember attending my only Objectivist conference, in Dallas, with
my good friend Jack Criss (a libertarian radio talk show host from
Jackson, Mississippi). Entitled “Meeting of the Minds,” the conference
showcased Objectivist stars David Kelley, John Ridpath, and Alan
Gotthelf. This was in March 1989, I believe, before David Kelley had
been purged from official Objectivist circles for daring to praise
Barbara Branden’s biography <em>The Passion of Ayn Rand</em>.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> I had corresponded with Kelley who
was gracious enough to take time to reply (this was before email) to my
questions. I have always admired and respected Kelley.</p>
<p>I had several stimulating conversations with him at the conference,
mostly on epistemology and philosophy. But I remember at a reception one
of the students telling how he had taken his copy of <em>The Passion of
Ayn Rand</em> and burned it in a private ceremony in his mom’s back yard
when he realized how “evil” it was. I think he sought to gain points
among his audience by relating this tale. I recall Jack and I looking at
each other with cocked eyebrows. “Book burning.” Yes. Well. That was the
last and only Objectivist conference I ever attended.</p>
<p>In the late-80s I started publishing columns in the LSU student
newspaper, <em>The Daily Reveille</em>, from an explicitly libertarian
perspective. As my interests became more sharply political and
philosophical, my girlfriend (later wife) and friends urged me to
consider law school. I was by this time in engineering grad school.
Unlike many attorneys, I was not one of those who had always wanted to
be a lawyer. In fact it never occurred to me until my girlfriend
suggested it over dinner, when I was wondering what degree I could
pursue next, so as to avoid having to enter the workforce. At the time I
thought one had to have a pre-law degree and many prerequisite courses
that engineers would lack; and I feared law school would be difficult. I
remember my girlfriend’s chemical engineer father laughing out loud at
my concern that law school might be more difficult than engineering. In
retrospect,<br />
I can say that law school is not easy, it is a lot of work—but it is not
that conceptually difficult. Lots of morons graduate from law
school.</p>
<p>By 1988 I was in law school and becoming a more well-rounded
libertarian, having read by this time Rothbard, Mises, Bastiat, the
Tannehills, and a non-trivial portion of the books offered in the
<em>Laissez-<br />
Faire Books</em> catalog. In that year there were two significant events
in my life, from a libertarian perspective. One was Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s
controversial and provocative article in <em>Liberty</em>, “The Ultimate
Justification of the Private Property Ethic.”<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
In this article Hoppe sets forth his “argumentation ethics,” which holds
that the libertarian<br />
private property ethic is implied in the very activity of
argumentation—because those engaged in argumentation already presuppose
the value of conflict-avoidance and the ability to control property and
thus, those arguing in favor of socialism contradict themselves.</p>
<p>The second thing was that I encountered the legal principle of
“estoppel” in my contracts class. This is the ubiquitous legal principle
that precludes someone from asserting a legal claim or position that is
inconsistent with earlier statements or behavior. I remember sitting in
contracts class, as Professor Morris lectured on this topic, thinking
“Eureka!” to myself, as I began to see that the concept of estoppel
meshed perfectly with libertarian logic (and also with Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics). The libertarian non-aggression principle holds
that force may only be used <em>in response</em> to (initiated) force.
There is a nice symmetry here. One may use force, if and only if it is
in response to initiated force (aggression).<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>I saw in class that day that the principle of estoppel could help
explain and justify the non-aggression rule. Force was justified against
an aggressor, because having used force himself he would be estopped
from objecting to retaliation. For him to assert that force is
wrong—which he must do in order to object to retaliation—would
contradict the “force is permissible” maxim underlying his own act of
aggression. He is “estopped” from asserting a claim inconsistent with
that underlying his earlier behavior.</p>
<p>My estoppel theory complements and draws on Hoppe’s argumentation
ethics. For years I believed that I first came up with my estoppel
theory and then read Hoppe’s work and linked the two together. Now I am
not so sure and think that I first read and absorbed Hoppe’s
argumentation ethic, which made me fixate on the similar logic of
estoppel when I coincidentally studied it in law school shortly
thereafter.</p>
<p>I was at King’s College London in 1991, pursuing a master’s degree in
law, when I produced the first draft of a paper arguing estoppel can
help justify libertarian rights. Somewhat naïvely, I submitted it to
King’s College Law School’s law review, whereupon it was summarily
rejected. Not daunted, I submitted an improved draft to Tibor Machan for
his journal <em>Reason Papers</em>. I had read many of Machan’s works,
including his <em>Human Rights and Human Liberties</em><a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
and <em>Individuals and Their Rights</em>,<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
and he had been kind enough to respond to several of my letters. I
remember speaking with him one night, about the submission, from a
students’ pay telephone at King’s College in London, and then getting
drinks at a pub with friends, none of them knowing or able to appreciate
that I had just spoken with a “famous” libertarian writer whose books I
had read. “Estoppel: A New Justification for Individual Rights” was
published in the Fall 1992 issue of <em>Reason Papers</em>.<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Another shift in my libertarian life occurred in 1994, when I first
met Lew Rockwell, Hans Hoppe, and Murray Rothbard. But let me back up.
After finally completing my nine years of higher education, I had to
earn a living. So in 1992 I started practicing law in Houston. When
Hoppe’s second English-language book, <em>The Economics and Ethics of
Private Property</em>, came out in 1993,<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> I
decided to do a review essay for a law review; the review was published
in 1994 in the <em>St. Mary’s Law Journal</em>.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> I
promptly sent it to Hoppe, who sent back a warm thank you note.</p>
<p>By mid-1994 I had moved to Philadelphia (I was there for three years,
until I returned to Houston in 1997, where I reside today), and resolved
to attend the John Randolph Club meeting in October 1994, near
Washington, D.C., which was a gathering of paleoconservatives from the
<em>Chronicles</em> crowd and several libertarians associated with the
Mises Institute, part of a short-lived attempt at yet another
libertarian-conservative “fusionism.”<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
My primary goal was to meet Hoppe, Rothbard, and Rockwell. I was
thrilled to meet them and other scholars associated with the Mises
Institute, and was able to get Murray to autograph my copy of <em>Man,
Economy, and State</em>,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> which he inscribed
“<em>To Stephan: For Man &amp; Economy, and against the state –Best
regards, Murray Rothbard.</em>” Well, I know the nicer one-volume
edition is out now, but just try to get me to part with my musty,
tattered two-volume copy. Rothbard unfortunately passed away in January
1995, just two months later, but I was happy that I was able to meet
him.</p>
<p>Since then I have attended many Mises Institute conferences,
including every one of the annual Austrian Scholars Conferences,
initiated, if I am not mistaken, in 1995. Over the years I gained more
appreciation for Mises and Austrian economics, and for the unparalleled
scope of Rothbard’s scholarly contributions to economics and political
philosophy, and related fields. I am now not only an
anarcho-libertarian, but a Misesian-Austrian. I have gained an
increasingly deeper respect for Lew Rockwell and the singular
achievement that is the Mises Institute. It has become my intellectual
home.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-what-libertarianism-is">Chapter 2: What Libertarianism
Is</h3>
<p>Originally published in <em>Property, Freedom, and Society: Essays in
Honor of Hans-Hermann Hoppe</em> (Guido Hülsmann &amp; Stephan Kinsella,
eds., Mises Institute, 2009). The original author’s note thanked “fellow
Hoppe aficionados Juan Fernando Carpio, Paul Edwards, Gil Guillory,
Manuel Lora, and Patrick Tinsley for helpful comments.”</p>
<h4 id="property-rights-and-liberty">Property, Rights, and Liberty</h4>
<p>Libertarians tend to agree on a wide array of policies and
principles. Nonetheless it is not easy to find consensus on what
libertarianism’s defining characteristic is, or on what distinguishes it
from other political theories and systems.</p>
<p>Various formulations abound. It is said that libertarianism is about:
individual rights; property rights;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> the free market;
capitalism; justice; the nonaggression principle. Not all these will do,
however. Capitalism and the free market describe the catallactic
conditions that arise or are permitted in a libertarian society, but do
not encompass other aspects of libertarianism. And individual rights,
justice, and aggression collapse into property rights. As Murray
Rothbard explained, individual rights <em>are</em> property rights.<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> And justice is just giving someone
his due—which, again, depends on what his rights are.<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The nonaggression principle is also dependent on property rights,
since what aggression is depends on what our (property) rights are. If
you hit me, it is aggression <em>because</em> I have a property right in
my body. If I take from you the apple you possess, this is trespass,
aggression, only <em>because</em> you own the apple. One cannot identify
an act of aggression without implicitly assigning a corresponding
property right to the victim.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>So, as descriptive terms for our political philosophy, capitalism and
the free market are too narrow, and justice, individual rights, and
aggression all boil down to, or are defined in terms of, property
rights.</p>
<p>What of property rights, then? Is this what differentiates
libertarianism from other political philosophies—that we favor property
rights, and all others do not? Surely such a claim is untenable. After
all, a property right is simply the <em>exclusive right to control a
scarce resource</em>—what I often refer to now as <em>conflictable</em>
resources.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Property rights specify which
persons own—have the right to control—various scarce resources in a
given region or jurisdiction. Yet everyone and every political theory
advances <em>some</em> theory of property. None of the various forms of
socialism deny property rights; each socialism will specify an owner for
every scarce resource.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> If the state nationalizes an
industry, it is asserting ownership of these means of production. If the
state taxes you, it is implicitly asserting ownership of the funds
taken. If my land is transferred to a private developer by eminent
domain statutes, the developer is now the owner. If the law allows a
recipient of racial discrimination to sue his employer for a sum of
money—he is the (new) owner of the money.<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
If the state conscripts someone, or imprisons them as the penalty for
refusing to serve in the military, or for failure to pay taxes, or for
using illegal narcotics, then the state is claiming legal ownership of
the person’s body.</p>
<p>Protection of and respect for property rights is thus not unique to
libertarianism. Every legal system defines and enforces some property
rights system. What is distinctive about libertarianism is its
<em>particular property assignment rules</em>—its view as to <em>who is
the owner</em> of each contestable, conflictable resource, and how to
determine this.</p>
<h4 id="libertarian-property-rights">LIBERTARIAN PROPERTY RIGHTS</h4>
<p>A system of property rights assigns a particular owner to every
scarce (conflictable) resource.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> These resources
obviously include natural resources such as land, fruits of trees, and
so on. Objects found in nature are not the only scarce resources,
however. Each human actor has, controls, and is identified and
associated with a unique human body, which is also a scarce resource.<a
href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Both human bodies and non-human
scarce resources are desired for use as means by actors in the pursuit
of various goals.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Accordingly, any political or legal system must assign ownership
rights in human bodies as well as in external things.</p>
<p>The libertarian view is that individual rights—property rights—are
assigned according to a few simple principles: <em>self-ownership,</em>
in the case of human bodies; and, in the case of previously-unowned
external things (conflictable resources), in accordance with principles
of <em>original</em> <em>appropriation</em>, <em>contractual title
transfer</em>, and <em>rectification</em>.<a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>
Let us discuss these in turn in the following sections. Note that in
this chapter I aim mostly to <em>describe</em> libertarian principles,
not necessarily to justify them; subsequent chapters provide further
arguments in support of these principles.</p>
<h4 id="property-in-bodies">Property IN BODIES</h4>
<p>Let us consider first the libertarian property assignment rules with
respect to human bodies, and the corresponding notion of aggression as
it pertains to bodies.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Libertarians often refer to the non-aggression principle, or NAP, as
their prime value. As Ayn Rand said, “So long as men desire to live
together, no man may <em>initiate</em>—do you hear me? No man may
<em>start</em>—the use of physical force against others.”<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
Or, as Rothbard put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The libertarian creed rests upon one central axiom: that no man or
group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else.
This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as
the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the
person or property of anyone else. Aggression is therefore synonymous
with invasion.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, libertarians maintain that the only way to violate
rights is by <em>initiating</em> force—that is, by committing
aggression. (Libertarianism also holds that, while the initiation of
force against another person’s body is impermissible, force used <em>in
response</em> to aggression—such as defensive, restitutive, or
retaliatory/punitive force—is justified.<a href="#fn43"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>)
Now in the case of the body, it is clear what aggression is: invading
the borders of someone’s body, commonly called battery, or, more
generally, <em>using the body of another without his or her
consent</em>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> The very notion of interpersonal
aggression presupposes property rights in bodies—more particularly, that
each person is, at least <em>prima facie</em>, the owner of his own
body.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Non-libertarian political philosophies have a different view. In
these systems, each person has some limited rights in his own body, but
not complete or exclusive rights. Society or the state, purporting to be
society’s agent, has certain rights in each citizen’s body, too. This
partial slavery is implicit in state actions and laws such as taxation,
conscription, and drug prohibitions.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> The libertarian says
that each person is the full owner of his body: he has the right to
control his body, to decide whether or not he ingests narcotics, joins
an army, pays taxes, and so on. Those various non-libertarians who
endorse any such state prohibitions, however, necessarily maintain that
the state, or society, is at least a partial owner of the body of those
subject to such laws—or even a complete owner in the case of
conscriptees or non-aggressor “criminals” incarcerated for life or
executed. Libertarians believe in <em>self</em>-ownership.
Non-libertarians—statists—of all stripes advocate some form of
slavery.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="self-ownership-and-conflict-avoidance">SELF-OWNERSHIP AND
CONFLICT AVOIDANCE</h4>
<p>Without property rights, there is always the possibility of conflict
over contestable resources. By assigning an owner to each resource,
legal systems make possible conflict-free use of resources by
establishing public, visible boundaries that non-owners can avoid.
Libertarianism does not endorse just any property assignment rule,
however.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> It favors <em>self</em>-ownership
over <em>other</em>-ownership (slavery).<a href="#fn49"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The libertarian seeks property assignment rules <em>because</em> he
values or accepts various <em>grundnorms</em> such as justice, peace,
prosperity, cooperation, conflict-avoidance, civilization.<a
href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> The libertarian view is that
self-ownership is the only property assignment rule compatible with
these <em>grundnorms</em>; it is implied by them. As Professor Hoppe has
shown, the assignment of ownership to a given resource must not be
random, arbitrary, particularistic, or biased if it is to actually be a
property norm that can serve the function of conflict-avoidance.<a
href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Property title has to be assigned
to one of competing claimants based on “the existence of an objective,
intersubjectively ascertainable link between owner and the” resource
claimed.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> In the case of one’s own body, it
is the unique relationship between a person and his body—<em>his direct
and immediate control</em> over his body, and the fact that, at least in
some sense, a body <em>is</em> a given person and vice versa—that
constitutes the objective link sufficient to give that person a claim to
his body superior to typical third party claimants.</p>
<p>Moreover, any outsider who claims another’s body cannot deny this
objective link and its special status, since the outsider also
necessarily presupposes this in his own case. This is so because in
seeking dominion over the other, in asserting ownership over the other’s
body, he has to presuppose his own ownership of his body, which
demonstrates he does place a certain significance on this link, at the
same time that he disregards the significance of the other’s link to his
own body.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Libertarianism realizes that only the self-ownership rule is
universalizable and compatible with the goals of peace, cooperation, and
conflict avoidance. We recognize that each person is <em>prima
facie</em> the owner of his own body because, by virtue of his unique
link to and connection with his own body—his direct and immediate
control over it—he has a better claim to it than anyone else.</p>
<h4 id="property-in-external-things">PROPERTY IN EXTERNAL THINGS</h4>
<p>Libertarians apply similar reasoning in the case of other scarce
resources—namely, external objects in the world that, unlike bodies,
were at one point <em>unowned</em>. In the case of bodies, the idea of
aggression being impermissible immediately implies self-ownership. In
the case of external objects, however, we must identify who the owner
<em>is</em> before we can determine what constitutes aggression.</p>
<p>As in the case with bodies, humans need to be able to use external
objects as means to achieve various ends. Because these things are
scarce, there is also the potential for conflict. And as in the case
with bodies, libertarians favor assigning property rights so as to
permit the peaceful, conflict-free, productive use of such resources. As
in the case with bodies, then, property is assigned to the person with
the best claim or link to a given scarce resource—with the “best claim”
standard based on the goals of permitting peaceful, conflict-free human
interaction and use of resources.</p>
<p>Unlike human bodies, however, external objects are not parts of one’s
identity, are not directly controlled by one’s will—and, significantly,
they are <em>initially unowned</em>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> Here, the libertarian
realizes that the relevant objective link is <em>original
appropriation</em>—the transformation or embordering of a previously
unowned resource, Lockean homesteading, the first use or possession of
the thing.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> Under this approach, the first
(prior) user of a previously unowned thing has a prima facie better
claim than a second (later) claimant solely by virtue of his being
earlier.</p>
<p>Why is appropriation the relevant link for determination of
ownership? First, keep in mind that the question with respect to such
scarce resources is: who is the resource’s <em>owner</em>? Recall that
ownership is the <em>right</em> to control, use, or possess,<a
href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> while possession is <em>actual</em>
control—“the <em>factual</em> <em>authority</em> that a person exercises
over a corporeal thing.”<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> The question is not
who has physical possession; it is who has ownership. Thus, asking who
is the owner of a resource presupposes <em>a distinction</em> between
ownership and possession—between the <em>right</em> to control (or
exclude) (ownership, or property rights), and <em>actual</em> control
(possession; economic dominion). And the answer has to take into account
the nature of previously-unowned things: to wit, that they must at some
point become owned by a first owner.</p>
<p>The answer must also take into account the presupposed goals of those
seeking this answer: rules that permit conflict-free use of resources.
For this reason, the answer cannot be whoever has the <em>resource or
whoever is able to take it</em> is its owner. To hold such a view is to
adopt a might makes right system where ownership collapses into
possession for want of a distinction.<a href="#fn58"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
Such a “system,” far from avoiding conflict, makes conflict
inevitable.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead of a might-makes-right approach, from the insights noted
above it is obvious that <em>ownership presupposes the prior-later
distinction</em>: whoever any given system specifies as the owner of a
resource <em>has a better claim than latecomers</em>.<a href="#fn60"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a>
If he does not, then he is not an owner, but merely the current user or
possessor, in a might-makes-right world in which there is no such thing
as ownership—which contradicts the presuppositions of the inquiry
itself. If the first owner does not have a better claim than latecomers,
then he is not an owner, but merely a possessor, and there is no such
thing as ownership. More generally, latecomers’ claims are inferior to
those of prior possessors or claimants, who either homesteaded the
resource or who can trace their title back to the homesteader or earlier
owner.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> The crucial importance of the
prior-later distinction to libertarian theory is why Professor Hoppe
repeatedly emphasizes it in his writing.<a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the libertarian position on property rights is that, in order
to permit conflict-free, productive use of scarce resources, property
titles to particular resources are assigned to particular owners. As
noted above, however, the title assignment must not be random,
arbitrary, or particularistic; instead, it has to be assigned based on
“the existence of an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable link
between owner and the” resource claimed.<a href="#fn63"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
As can be seen from the considerations presented above, the link is the
physical transformation or embordering of the original homesteader, or a
chain of title traceable by contract back to him.<a href="#fn64"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>As Hoppe summarizes self-ownership rights and property rights in
external resources based in original appropriation and contractual title
transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But who owns what scarce resource as his private property and who
does not? First: Each person owns his physical body that only he and no
one else controls <em>directly</em> (I can control your body only
in-directly, by first directly controlling my body, and vice versa) and
that only he directly controls also in particular when <em>discussing
and arguing</em> the question at hand. Otherwise, if body-ownership were
assigned to some indirect body-controller, conflict would become
unavoidable as the direct body-controller <em>cannot</em> give up his
direct control over his body as long as he is alive; and in particular,
otherwise it would be impossible that any two persons, as the contenders
in any property dispute, could ever <em>argue and debate</em> the
question whose will is to prevail, since arguing and debating
<em>presupposes</em> that both, the proponent and the opponent, have
exclusive control over their respective bodies and so come to the
correct judgment <em>on their own</em>, without a fight (in a
conflict-free form of interaction).</p>
<p>And second, as for scarce resources that can be controlled
<em>only</em> indirectly (that must be appropriated with our own
nature-given, i.e., un-appropriated, body): Exclusive control (property)
is acquired by and assigned to that person, who appropriated the
resource in question <em>first</em> or who acquired it through voluntary
(conflict-free) exchange from its <em>previous</em> owner. For only the
first appropriator of a resource (and all later owners connected to him
through a chain of voluntary exchanges) can possibly acquire and gain
control over it without conflict, i.e., peacefully. Otherwise, if
exclusive control is assigned instead to <em>latecomers</em>, conflict
is not avoided but contrary to the very purpose of norms made
unavoidable and permanent.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="consistency-and-principle">CONSISTENCY AND PRINCIPLE</h4>
<p>Not only libertarians are civilized. Most people give some weight to
some of the above considerations. In their eyes, a person is the owner
of his own body—usually. A homesteader owns the resource he
appropriates—unless the state takes it from him “by operation of law.”<a
href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> This is the principal distinction
between libertarians and non-libertarians: libertarians are consistently
opposed to aggression, defined in terms of invasion of property borders,
where property rights are understood to be assigned on the basis of
self-ownership, in the case of bodies, and on the basis of prior
possession or homesteading and contractual transfer of title, in the
case of other things (plus transfers for purposes of rectification).</p>
<p>This framework for rights is motivated by the libertarian’s
consistent and principled valuing of peaceful interaction and
cooperation—<br />
in short, of civilized behavior. A parallel to the Misesian view of
human action may be illuminating here. According to Mises, human action
is aimed at alleviating some felt uneasiness.<a href="#fn67"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>
Thus, means are employed, according to the actor’s understanding of
causal laws, to achieve various ends—ultimately, the removal of some
<em>felt uneasiness</em>.</p>
<p>Civilized man feels uneasy at the prospect of violent struggles with
others. On the one hand, he wants, for some practical reason, to control
a given scarce resource and to use violence against another person, if
necessary, to achieve this control. On the other hand, he also wants to
avoid a wrongful use of force. Civilized man, for some reason, feels
reluctance, uneasiness, at the prospect of violent interaction with his
fellow man. Perhaps he has reluctance to violently clash with others
over certain objects because he has empathy with them.<a href="#fn68"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>
Perhaps the instinct to cooperate is a result of social evolution. As
Mises noted,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are people whose only aim is to improve the condition of their
own ego. There are other people with whom awareness of the troubles of
their fellow men causes as much uneasiness as or even more uneasiness
than their own wants.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the reason, because of this uneasiness, when there is the
potential for violent conflict, the civilized man seeks justification
for the forceful control of a scarce resource which he desires but which
some other person opposes. Empathy—or whatever spurs man to adopt the
libertarian <em>grundnorms</em>—gives rise to a certain form of
uneasiness, which gives rise to <em>ethical action</em>. Civilized man
may be defined as he who seeks justification for the use of
interpersonal violence. When the inevitable need to engage in violence
arises—for defense of life or property—civilized man seeks
justification. Naturally, since this justification-seeking is done by
people who are inclined to reason and peace (justification is after all
a peaceful activity that necessarily takes place during discourse),<a
href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> what they seek are rules that are
fair, potentially acceptable to all, grounded in the nature of things,
and universalizable, and that permit conflict-free use of resources.
Libertarian property rights principles emerge as the only candidate that
satisfies these criteria. Thus, if civilized man is he who seeks
justification for the use of violence, the libertarian is he who is
<em>serious</em> about this endeavor. He has a deep, principled, innate
opposition to violence, and an equally deep commitment to peace and
cooperation.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, libertarianism may be said to be the
political philosophy that <em>consistently</em> favors social rules
aimed at promoting peace, prosperity, and cooperation.<a href="#fn71"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>
It recognizes that the only rules that satisfy the civilized
<em>grundnorms</em> are the self-ownership principle and the Lockean
homesteading principle, applied as consistently as possible.</p>
<p>And as I have argued elsewhere, because the state necessarily commits
aggression, the consistent libertarian, in opposing aggression, is also
an anarchist.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"

<h5 id="propertyconcept-and-terminology">“PROPERTY”—CONCEPT AND
TERMINOLOGY</h5>
<p>As noted above, the material here was originally intended to appear
in footnote 5, above. Due to its length, I include this material in this
appendix.</p>
<h5 id="concept-and-definition-of-property"><em>Concept and Definition
of “Property”</em></h5>
<p>As Professor Yiannopoulos explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Property</em> is a word with high emotional overtones and so many
meanings that it has defied attempts at accurate all-inclusive
definition. The English word <em>property</em> derives from the Latin
<em>proprietas</em>, a noun form of <em>proprius</em>, which means one’s
own. In the United States, the word <em>property</em> is frequently used
to denote indiscriminately either the <em>objects</em> of rights … or
the <em>rights</em> that persons have <em>with respect to things</em>.
Thus, lands, automobiles, and jewels are said to be property; and
rights, such as ownership, servitudes, and leases, are likewise said to
be property. This latent confusion between rights and their objects has
its roots in texts of Roman law and is also encountered in other legal
systems of the western world. <em>Accurate analysis should reserve the
use of the word property for the designation of rights that persons have
with respect to things.</em></p>
<p><em>Property</em> may be defined as an <em>exclusive right to control
an economic good</em>…; it is the name of a concept that refers to the
rights and obligations, privileges and restrictions that govern the
relations of man with respect to <em>things of value</em>. People
everywhere and at all times desire the possession of things that are
necessary for survival or valuable by cultural definition and which, as
a result of the demand placed upon them, <em>become scarce</em>. Laws
enforced by organized society control the competition for, and guarantee
the enjoyment of, these desired things. What is guaranteed to be one’s
own is property….</p>
<p>[Property rights] <em>confer a direct and immediate authority over a
thing.</em><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this book, I endeavor to use the term “property” to refer to
rights a person has with respect to a given thing or resource, instead
of to the thing itself, but on occasion (partly due to the fact that
many of these chapters are over 20 years old and I did not want to
rewrite everything completely), I will employ the more colloquial usage
where “property” refers to the object or resource or thing owned. It is
sometimes necessary to avoid the inconvenience of nonstandard language
in order to communicate (just as I use the term “intellectual property”
in discussing modern patent and copyright law, even though I dislike the
term,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> so that people understand what I’m
referring to).</p>
<h5 id="things"><em>“Things”</em></h5>
<p>As Yiannopoulos notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accurate definition of the word <em>things</em> is indispensable in
view of the fact that only things in the legal sense may be objects of
property rights…. In most legal systems, including common law
jurisdictions, Louisiana, and legal systems of the French family, the
word things applies both to physical objects and incorporeals
[intangibles]. In legal systems following the model of the German Civil
Code, however, the word things applies only to corporeal objects that
are susceptible of appropriation.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the concept of “thing” in the civil law (<em>res</em> under
Roman law; <em>bien</em> (good) and <em>chose</em> (corporeal thing)
under French law; <em>Sache</em> under German law) denotes certain
objects of rights in the law.</p>
<p>Things are also divided into different types, such as common, public,
and private; corporeals and incorporeals; and movables and immovables.<a
href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> Things are divided into other
types, as well, such as things in commerce and out of commerce,
consumable and non-consumable, and so on.<a href="#fn77"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>The civil law concept of things, especially private things, more or
less corresponds to the notion of economic goods, or appropriable
objects having a pecuniary value, which itself is close to the concept
of <em>conflictable</em> (contestable, rivalrous, scarce) resources I
use in this book to refer to the types of things that can be the subject
of property rights—that can be owned (see the section “Conflictable
vs. Scarce,” below). They are things that can be used by acting man as
means of action—possessed—and in society, that can be owned (property
rights).<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="property-as-a-right-to-exclude"><em>Property as a Right to
Exclude</em></h5>
<p>Technically speaking, a property right is not a right to
<em>control</em> a resource but a <em>right to exclude others from using
the resource</em>. Ironically, this is how patent rights work, although
most non-specialists have trouble understanding this; having a patent on
an invention does <em>not</em> allow the inventor to make or use it, but
only to <em>prevent others</em> from doing so.<a href="#fn79"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a><br />
I have explained elsewhere why property rights do not give the owner a
right to control or use the resource.<a href="#fn80"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>
However, for our purposes in this chapter, this distinction is not
particularly germane.</p>
<h5 id="property-as-a-right-between-people"><em>Property as a Right
between People</em></h5>
<p>Moreover, as noted in “A Libertarian Theory of Contract” (ch. 9),
n.1, property rights can be conceived of not as a right between a human
actor and an owned object, but rather as a right <em>as between human
actors</em>, but <em>with respect to particular (owned)
resources</em>.</p>
<p>As Judge Alex Kozinski writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what is property? That is not an easy question to answer. I
remember sitting in my first-year property course on the first day of
class when the professor … asked the fundamental question: What are
property rights? … I threw up my hand and without even waiting to be
called on I shouted out, “Property rights define the relationship
between people and their property.”</p>
<p>Professor Krier stopped dead in his tracks, spun around, and gave me
a long look. Finally he said: “That’s very peculiar, Mr. Kozinski. Have
you always had relations with inanimate objects? Most people I know have
relations with other people.”</p>
<p>That was certainly not the last time I said something really dumb in
class, but the lesson was not lost on me. Property rights are, of
course, a species of relationships between people. At the minimum, they
define the degree to which individuals may exclude other individuals
from the use and enjoyment of their goods and services….<a href="#fn81"

<p>As noted elsewhere, in recent years I tend to emphasize the rivalrous
or “conflictable” nature of ownable resources to avoid the inevitable
equivocation when the term “scarce” is used. When I refer to scarce
resources in this book it is to be understood as meaning conflictable
resources.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"

<h4 id="appendix-ii">**APPENDIX II**</h4>
<h5 id="mutualist-occupancy">MUTUALIST OCCUPANCY</h5>
<p>As noted above, the material here was originally intended to appear
in footnote 31, above. Due to its length, I include this material in
this appendix.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the text above, any workable and just legal system
must distinguish ownership from possession, and must recognize the
prior-later distinction. Instead of a might-makes-right approach, the
owner of a resource has a better claim than latecomers. If he does not,
then he is not an owner, but merely the current user or possessor, in a
might-makes-right world in which there is no such thing as
ownership.</p>
<p>I have observed that this is also the reason the mutualist
“occupancy” position on land ownership is unlibertarian and unjust.</p>
<p>Mutualist Kevin Carson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For mutualists, <em>occupancy and use</em> is the only legitimate
standard for establishing ownership of land, regardless of how many
times it has changed hands. An existing owner may transfer ownership by
sale or gift; but the new owner may establish legitimate title to the
land <em>only by his own occupancy and use</em>. A change in occupancy
will amount to a change in ownership…. The <em>actual occupant is
considered the owner of a tract of land</em>, and any attempt to collect
rent by a self-styled [“absentee”] landlord is regarded as a <em>violent
invasion of the possessor’s absolute right of property</em>.<a
href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, for mutualism, the “actual occupant” is the “owner”; the
“possessor” has the right of property. If a homesteader of land stops
personally using or occupying it, he loses his ownership. Carson
contends this is compatible with libertarianism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]ll property rights theories, including Lockean, make provision for
<em>adverse possession and constructive abandonment of property</em>.
They differ only in degree, rather than kind: in the “stickiness” of
property…. There is a large element of convention in any property rights
system—Georgist, mutualist, and both proviso and nonproviso
Lockeanism—in determining what constitutes transfer and abandonment.<a
href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Lockeanism, Georgism, and mutualism are all types of
libertarianism, differing <em>only in degree</em>. In Carson’s view, the
gray areas in issues like adverse possession and abandonment leave room
for mutualism’s “occupancy” requirement for maintaining land
ownership.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>But the concepts of adverse possession and abandonment cannot be
stretched to cover the mutualist occupancy requirement. The mutualist
occupancy view is essentially a <em>use</em> or <em>working</em>
requirement, which is distinct from doctrines of adverse possession and
abandonment. The doctrine of abandonment in positive law and in
libertarian theory is based on the idea that ownership <em>acquired</em>
by <em>intentionally</em> appropriating a previously unowned thing may
be lost when the owner’s intent to own terminates. Ownership is acquired
by a merger of possession and intent to own. Likewise, when the intent
to own ceases, ownership does too—this is the case with both abandonment
of ownership <em>and</em> transfer of title to another person, which is
basically an abandonment of property “in favor” of a particular new
owner.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>The legal system must therefore develop rules to determine when
property has been abandoned, including default rules that apply <em>in
the absence of clear evidence</em>. Acquisitive prescription is based on
an implicit presumption that the owner has abandoned his property claims
if he does not defend it within a reasonable time period against an
adverse possessor. But such rules apply to <em>adverse</em>
possessors—those who possess the property <em>with the intent to
own</em> and in a sufficiently public fashion that the owner knows or
should know of this.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> The “public” requirement means that
the possessor possesses the property openly as <em>owner</em>, adverse
or hostile to the owner’s ownership—which is <em>not</em> the case when,
for example, a lessee or employee uses an apartment or manufacturing
facility under color of title and <em>permission</em> from the owner.
Rules of abandonment and adverse possession are default rules that apply
when the owner has <em>not</em> made his intention sufficiently clear—by
neglect, apathy, death, absence, or other reason.</p>
<p>In fact, the very idea of abandonment rests on the distinction
between ownership and possession. Property is more than possession; it
is a right to possess, originating and sustained by the owner’s
<em>intention</em> to possess as owner. And abandonment occurs when the
intent to own terminates. This happens even when the (immediately
preceding) owner temporarily maintains possession but has lost
ownership, as when he gives or sells the thing to another party.<a
href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Clearly, default abandonment and adverse possession rules are
categorically different from a working requirement, whereby ownership is
lost in the <em>absence of use</em>.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> Ownership is not lost
by nonuse, however, and a working requirement is <em>not</em> implied by
default rules regarding abandonment and adverse possession. See, e.g.,
Louisiana Civil Code, art. 481 (emphasis added): “The ownership and the
possession of a thing are distinct…. Ownership exists independently of
any exercise of it and <em>may not be lost by nonuse</em>. Ownership is
lost when acquisitive prescription accrues in favor of an adverse
possessor.” Carson is wrong to imply that abandonment and adverse
possession rules can yield a working (or <em>use</em> or
<em>occupancy</em>) requirement for maintaining ownership. In fact,
these are distinct legal doctrines. Thus, when a factory owner
contractually allows workers to use it, or a landlord permits tenants to
live in an apartment, there is no question that the owner <em>does not
intend to abandon</em> the property, and there is no <em>adverse</em>
possession (and if there were, the owner could institute the appropriate
action to eject them and regain possession).<a href="#fn90"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a>
There is no need for “default” rules here to resolve an ambiguous
situation.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>A final note here: I cite positive law here not as an argument from
authority, but as an illustration that even the positive law carefully
distinguishes between possession and ownership—and also between a
<em>use</em> or <em>working</em> requirement to maintain ownership, and
the potential to lose title by abandonment or adverse possession—to
illustrate the flaws in Carson’s view that an occupancy requirement is
just one variant of adverse possession or default abandonment rules.
Furthermore, the civilian legal rules cited derive from legal principles
developed over the ages in largely decentralized fashion, and can thus
be useful in our own libertarian efforts to develop concrete
applications of abstract libertarian principles.<a href="#fn92"

What It Means To Be an Anarcho-Capitalist</h3>
<p>Originally published at <em>LewRockwell.com</em> (Jan. 20, 2004;
https://perma.cc/QAJ6-KHKN); reprinted in Keith Knight, ed., <em>The
Voluntaryist Handbook: A Collection of Essays, Excerpts, and Quotes</em>

of the Impossibility of Anarcho-Libertarianism,” <em>Mises Economics
Blog</em> (Aug. 20, 2009).</p>
<p>Butler Shaffer’s recent LRC article, “What is Anarchy?,”<a
href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a> prompted discussion on the
<em>Reason</em> blog and inspired me to set down a few ideas I’ve also
had along these lines.</p>
<p>Libertarian opponents of anarchy are attacking a straw man. Their
arguments are usually utilitarian in nature and amount to “but anarchy
won’t work” or “we need the (things provided by the) state.” But these
attacks are confused at best, if not disingenuous. To be an anarchist
does not mean you think anarchy will “work” (whatever that means), nor
that you predict it will or “can” be achieved. It is possible to be a
pessimistic anarchist, after all. To be an anarchist only means that you
believe that aggression is not justified, and that states necessarily
employ aggression. And, therefore, that states, and the aggression they
necessarily employ, are unjustified. It’s quite simple, really. It’s an
ethical view, so no surprise it confuses utilitarians.</p>
<p>Accordingly, anyone who is not an anarchist must maintain either: (a)
aggression is justified; or (b) states (in particular, minimal states)
do not necessarily employ aggression.</p>
<p>Proposition (b) is plainly false. States always tax their citizens,
which is a form of aggression. They always outlaw competing defense
agencies, which also amounts to aggression. (Not to mention the
countless victimless crime laws that they inevitably, and without a
single exception in history, enforce on the populace. Why minarchists
think minarchy is even possible boggles the mind.)</p>
<p>As for (a), well, socialists and criminals also feel aggression is
justified. This does not make it so. Criminals, socialists, and
anti-anarchists have yet to show how aggression—the initiation of force
against innocent victims—is justified. No surprise; it is not possible<a
href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> to show this.<a href="#fn95"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a>
But criminals don’t feel compelled to justify aggression; why should
advocates of the state feel compelled to do so?</p>
<p>Conservative and minarchist-libertarian criticism of anarchy on the
grounds that it won’t “work” or is not “practical” is just confused.
Anarchists don’t (necessarily) predict anarchy will be achieved—I for
one don’t think it will. But that does not mean states are
justified.</p>
<p>Consider an analogy. Conservatives and libertarians all agree that
private crime (murder, robbery, rape) is unjustified, and “should” not
occur. Yet no matter how good most men become, there will always be at
least some small element who will resort to crime. Crime will always be
with us. Yet we still condemn crime and work to reduce it.</p>
<p>Is it logically possible that there could be no crime? Sure. Everyone
could voluntarily choose to respect others’ rights. Then there would be
no crime. It’s easy to imagine. But given our experience with human
nature and interaction, it is safe to say that there will always be
crime. Nevertheless, we still proclaim crime to be evil and unjustified,
in the face of the inevitability of its recurrence. So to my claim that
crime is immoral, it would just be stupid and/or insincere to reply,
“but that’s an impractical view” or “but that won’t work,” “since there
will always be crime.” The fact that there will always be crime—that not
everyone will voluntarily respect others’ rights—does not mean that it’s
“impractical” to oppose it; nor does it mean that crime is justified. It
does not mean there is some “flaw” in the proposition that crime is
wrong.</p>
<p>Likewise, to my claim that the state and its aggression is
unjustified, it is disingenuous and/or confused to reply, “anarchy won’t
work” or is “impractical” or “unlikely to ever occur.”<a href="#fn96"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a>
The view that the state is unjustified is a normative or ethical
position. The fact that not enough people are willing to respect their
neighbors’ rights to allow anarchy to emerge, i.e., the fact that enough
people (erroneously) support the legitimacy of the state to permit it to
exist, does not mean that the state, and its aggression, are
justified.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Other utilitarian replies like “but we need a state” do not
contradict the claim that states employ aggression and that aggression
is unjustified. It simply means that the state-advocate does not mind
the initiation of force against innocent victims—i.e., he shares the
criminal/socialist mentality. The private criminal thinks his own need
is all that matters; he is willing to commit violence to satisfy his
needs; to hell with what is right and wrong. The advocate of the state
thinks that his opinion that “we” “need” things justifies committing or
condoning violence against innocent individuals. It is as plain as that.
Whatever this argument is, it is not libertarian. It is not opposed to
aggression. It is in favor of something else—making sure certain public
“needs” are met, despite the cost—but not peace and cooperation. The
criminal, gangster, socialist, welfare-statist, and even minarchist all
share this: they are willing to condone naked aggression, for some
reason. The details vary, but the result is the same—innocent lives are
trampled by physical assault. Some have the stomach for this; others are
more civilized—libertarian, one might say—and prefer peace over violent
struggle.</p>
<p>As there are criminals and socialists among us, it is no surprise
that there is a degree of criminal-mindedness in most people. After all,
the state rests upon the tacit consent of the masses, who have
erroneously accepted the notion that states are legitimate. But none of
that means the criminal enterprises condoned by the masses are
justified.</p>
<p>It’s time for libertarians to take a stand. Are you for aggression,
or against it?<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"

illustrating photo chosen by an editor at Mises.org for the original

<p>The primary social evil of our time is lack of respect for
self-ownership rights. It is what underlies both private crime and
institutionalized crime perpetrated by the state. State laws,
regulations, and actions are objectionable <em>just because</em> the
state is claiming the legal right to control how someone’s body is to be
used.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>When the state drafts a man or threatens him with imprisonment if he
violates its narcotics laws, for example, it is assuming partial control
of his body, contrary to his self-ownership rights. Moreover, laws such
as tax laws or fines for failure to comply with arbitrary state decrees
(e.g., economic regulations, anti-discrimination rules) also violate
self-ownership rights, to the extent they threaten to imprison or harm
the body of the person, and in any case violate the person’s derivative
property rights in the expropriated resources.</p>
<p>After all, although self-ownership is more fundamental than rights in
external resources—one must own oneself, one’s body, in order to own
other things—self-ownership is rendered meaningless if the right to own
private property in external resources is not also respected.<a
href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> This is why Murray Rothbard
insisted that all “human rights” are property rights: that is, ownership
rights in scarce resources, whether self-ownership rights in one’s body,
or property rights in external objects.<a href="#fn101"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Now as the examples above show, all political theories advocate some
form of property rights, since they specify certain owners of various
types of resources.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a> State policies that tax,
conscript, or imprison or fine individuals for failure to comply with
various regulations in effect assign partial ownership in the subjects’
bodies or other owned resources to the state. The state claims a partial
ownership right in these resources.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>All political systems assign owners to resources according to some
assignment rule. What sets libertarianism apart is its own unique
property-assignment rule: the rule that specifies that individuals, not
the state, are owners of their own bodies and other external scarce
resources.</p>
<h4 id="first-use-and-homesteading-of-unowned-resources">FIRST USE AND
HOMESTEADING OF UNOWNED RESOURCES</h4>
<p>It is, therefore, crucial that libertarian theory have a sound basis
for property rights and for its unique property assignment rules.</p>
<p>Relying on some version of the Lockean notion of
<em>homesteading</em> or <em>original</em> <em>appropriation</em>—an
individual <em>appropriating</em> something <em>unowned</em> from the
state of nature, thereby becoming the owner—libertarianism rightly
focuses on the concept of <em>first use</em> of a <em>previously</em>
<em>unowned scarce resource</em> as the key test for determining
ownership of it.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>One’s initial impression might be that first use is the bedrock
principle of libertarian property assignment, that is, that it decides
questions of ownership of <em>all</em> scarce resources, both human
bodies and external things. The owner of a plot of land is its first
user (or his descendent in title), just as the first user of a body is
its owner. This would mean that self-ownership rests on the first use
principle, or homesteading.</p>
<h4 id="parents-as-first-owners">PARENTS AS FIRST OWNERS</h4>
<p>And what is wrong with relying on first use as the basis for
self-ownership? To be sure, with respect to most claimants to one’s
body—a robber or state trying to conscript, say—one is indeed the “first
user,” or a prior user, and thus has a better claim to the body than the
outsider. <a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> But what about one’s parents? Is
one really the <em>first user</em> of one’s body? Was one’s body simply
lying around unowned, in state of nature, waiting for some occupant to
swoop down and appropriate it?</p>
<p>No, obviously not. One’s body was in the care of—and in a sense
produced by—one’s parents, in particular one’s mother. So if we maintain
that “first use” always determines the answer to the question “who owns
this resource?,” for any resource at all, then it would seem that
parents <em>do</em> own their children. The mother owns the physical
matter and bits of food and nourishment that assemble into the zygote,
embryo, fetus, and then baby, just as the owner of an apple tree owns
the apples that fall and the owner of a cow owns the calves it
produces.</p>
<p>So, when does the child become a self-owner? Or does he? The
libertarian seems to be faced with a dilemma.</p>
<h4 id="possible-solutions-to-the-dilemma">POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE
DILEMMA</h4>
<p>Several possible arguments might be put forward to avoid the
uncomfortable specter of children in bondage, slaves owned by their
parents. First, it could be noted that the main political issue in
society concerns third parties who want to dominate and control others.
Slaveowning parents do not seem to pose the most pressing danger. For
the typical case of conflict, the first-use principle suffices to prove
self-ownership of one’s body vis-à-vis the third party claimant. Still,
this leaves open the possibility of parents owning their children.</p>
<p>Second, it could be argued that even if the parent does own the
child, in <em>most</em> cases a decent parent would voluntarily manumit
the child at a suitable age. This is probably true, but the possibility
of a brutal parent selling his son or daughter into slavery is still
unsettling.</p>
<p>Third, it is not difficult to envision a scenario in which most lines
of descent, at some point, become permanently “liberated” or
“manumitted” by the benevolent actions of a key ancestor.
Great-great-great-Grand-dad manumits his child on the condition that he
free his issue, and so on. In this way, eventually all or most lines of
descent become freed by some distant act in the past of a benevolent
ancestor. But still, this leaves open the possibility that some might
not; and, in any event, it admits that at some points in time,
child-slavery exists and is permissible.</p>
<p>Finally, and to me most decisive: it could be argued that the parent
has various <em>positive obligations</em> to his or her children, such
as the obligation to feed, shelter, educate, etc. The idea here is that
libertarianism does not oppose “positive rights”; it simply insists that
they be <em>voluntarily incurred</em>. One way to do this is by
contract, or so some would argue;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a> another is by
trespassing against someone’s property. Now, if you pass by a drowning
man in a lake you have no enforceable (legal) obligation to try to
rescue him; but if you push someone in a lake you have a positive
obligation to try to rescue him, to mitigate the harm resulting from
your tort. If you don’t attempt the rescue, you could be liable for
homicide.</p>
<p>Likewise, if your voluntary actions bring into being an infant with
natural needs for shelter, food, care, and with human rights, it is akin
to throwing someone into a lake. In both cases you create a situation
where another human is in dire need of help and without which he will
perish. By creating this situation of need you incur an obligation to
provide for those needs. And surely this set of positive obligations to
one’s child would encompass the obligation to manumit the child at a
certain point. This last argument is, to my mind, the most attractive,
but it is also probably the least likely to be accepted by most
libertarians, who generally seem opposed to positive obligations, even
if they are incurred as the result of one’s actions. Rothbard, for
example, puts forward several objections to such an approach.<a
href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="objective-link-the-real-touchstone">OBJECTIVE LINK: THE REAL
TOUCHSTONE</h4>
<p>All this said, it turns out that these Herculean efforts are
unnecessary. The dilemma arises only if it is assumed that “first use”
determines ownership not only for homesteaded resources, but also for
bodies.</p>
<p>However, the “first use” rule is merely the result of the application
of the more general principle of <em>objective link</em> to the case of
objects that may be homesteaded from an unowned state. Recall that the
purpose of property rights is to permit conflicts over scarce
(rivalrous, conflictable) resources to be avoided.<a href="#fn108"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>
To fulfill this purpose, property titles to particular resources are
assigned to particular owners. The assignment must not, however, be
random, arbitrary, or biased, if it is to actually be a property norm
and possibly help conflict to be avoided. What this means is that title
has to be assigned to one of the competing claimants based on “the
existence of an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable link between
owner and the” resource claimed.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, it is the concept of <em>objective link</em> between claimants
and a claimed resource that determines property ownership. First use is
merely what constitutes the objective link in the case of previously
unowned resources. In this case, the only objective link to the thing is
that between the first user—the appropriator—and the thing. Any other
supposed link is not objective, and is merely based on verbal decree, or
on some type of formulation that violates the prior-later distinction.
But the prior-later distinction is crucial if property rights are to
actually establish rights and make conflict avoidable. Moreover,
ownership claims cannot be based on mere verbal decree, as this also
would not help to reduce conflict, since any number of people could
simply decree their ownership of the thing.<a href="#fn110"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>So for homesteaded things—previously unowned resources—the objective
link <em>is</em> first use. It has to be, by the nature of the
situation.</p>
<h4 id="human-bodies"><em>Human Bodies</em></h4>
<p>But for human bodies, matters are somewhat different. As noted above,
one is not really the “first user” of one’s body in the same sense as
one is the first user of a previously unowned thing that one
appropriates. It’s not as if the body was just lying, unoccupied and
unused, in the wild, waiting for an occupant to homestead it. And
moreover, as noted above, the occupant is not exactly the first user of
his body, with respect to his parents.</p>
<p>Additionally, to homestead an <em>unowned</em> resource
<em>presupposes one already has a body</em>, which one uses to
<em>act</em> in the world and to homestead such unowned things. But this
is not the case for “homesteading” one’s body. One has no body before
one gains rights to it.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="direct-control"><em>Direct Control</em></h4>
<p>If “first use” is not the ultimate test for the “objective link” in
the case of body ownership, what is? It is the unique relationship
between a person and “his” body—his <em>direct and immediate
control</em> over the body, and the fact that, at least in some sense, a
body <em>is</em> a given person and vice-versa (as it is impossible to
imagine a person that does not have a body, without accepting groundless
religious conceptions). This is what constitutes the objective link
sufficient to give that person better title to his body than any third
party claimant, even his parents.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a> (This link is only a
presumption, it is defeasible, as noted below, since it may be severed
or forfeited by a person committing an act of aggression that gives the
victim rights over the aggressor’s body, for purposes of self-defense,
restitution, or retribution.)</p>
<p>Moreover, any outsider who claims another’s body cannot deny this
objective link and its special status, since the outsider also
necessarily presupposes this in his own case. This is so because in
seeking dominion over the other, in asserting ownership over the other’s
body, he has to presuppose his own ownership of his body, which
demonstrates he does place a certain significance on this link, at the
same time that he disregards the significance of the other’s link to his
own body. (Notice that if a victim seeks dominion over the body of his
aggressor for purposes of self-defense or proportional punishment, his
claim of ownership over the aggressor’s body is not incompatible with a
claim of self-ownership, since the cases are different. It is not
inconsistent to claim that the special link between an innocent person
and his body gives him the best claim over that body, and to also claim
that this no longer holds for an aggressor because he has committed
aggression. This distinction is neither arbitrary nor particularizable;
it is grounded in the nature of things.)<a href="#fn113"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>The basic point about the primacy of the “direct” link over an
“indirect” link (<em>ceteris paribus</em>—see the point above about
punishment of criminals) was first suggested to me by Hoppe. As might be
apparent to those familiar with Hoppe’s argumentation ethics,<a
href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a> the Hoppean theory implies the
logical priority of direct versus indirect control over one’s body. In
fact, the argument made above (that any outsider who claims another’s
body cannot deny the objective link between person and body) is merely
an application of Hoppe’s argumentation ethics approach. It turns out
Hoppe made a similar argument in a German publication in 1987:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer to the question what makes my body “mine” lies in the
obvious fact that this is not merely an assertion but that, for everyone
to see, this <em>is</em> indeed the case. Why do we say “This is my
body”? For this, a twofold requirement exists. On the one hand it must
be the case that the body called “mine” must indeed (in an
intersubjectively ascertainable way) express or “objectify” my will.
Proof of this, as far as my body is concerned, is easy enough to
demonstrate: When I announce that I will now lift my arm, turn my head,
relax in my chair (or whatever else) and these announcements then become
true (are fulfilled), then this shows that the body which does this has
been indeed appropriated by my will. If, to the contrary, my
announcements showed no systematic relation to my body’s actual
behavior, then the proposition “this is my body” would have to be
considered as an empty, objectively unfounded assertion; and likewise
this proposition would be rejected as incorrect if following my
announcement not my arm would rise but always that of Müller, Meier, or
Schulze (in which case one would more likely be inclined to consider
Müller’s, Meier’s, or Schulze’s body “mine”). On the other hand, apart
from demonstrating that my will has been “objectified” in the body
called “mine,” it must be demonstrated that my appropriation has
<em>priority</em> as compared to the possible appropriation of the same
body by another person.</p>
<p>As far as bodies are concerned, it is also easy to prove this. We
demonstrate it by showing that it is under my <em>direct</em> control,
while every other person can objectify (express) itself in my body only
<em>indirectly</em>, i.e., by means of their own bodies, and direct
control must obviously have logical-temporal priority (precedence) as
compared to any indirect control. The latter simply follows from the
fact that any indirect control of a good by a person presupposes the
direct control of this person regarding his own body; thus, in order for
a scarce good to become justifiably appropriated, the appropriation of
one’s directly controlled “own” body must already be
<em>presupposed</em> as justified. It thus follows: If the justice of an
appropriation by means of direct control must be presupposed by any
further-reaching indirect appropriation, and if only I have direct
control of my body, then no one except me can ever justifiably own my
body (or, put differently, then property in/of my body cannot be
transferred onto another person), and every attempt of an indirect
control of my body by another person must, unless I have explicitly
agreed to it, be regarded as unjust(ified).<a href="#fn115"

<p>And as Hoppe adds in the Foreword, “if body-ownership were assigned
to some indirect body-controller, <em>conflict would become
unavoidable</em> as the direct body-controller cannot give up the direct
control over his body as long as he is alive” (emphasis added). In other
words, direct control has logical-temporal priority as compared to any
indirect<br />
control, since otherwise conflict is unavoidable, contrary to the very
purpose of property norms.</p>
<h4 id="summary"><em>Summary</em></h4>
<p>Perhaps it is time to summarize the (interrelated) reasons why direct
control is the relevant link for determining ownership of human bodies,
and why self-ownership is thus justified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.<br />
First, it is intuitively obvious; it’s the “natural” position. Who
better to own my body than me? (See Hoppe’s discussion of this in <em>A
Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</em>, at p. 21 <em>et seq.</em>) As
Locke wrote, “every man has a property in his own person: this no body
has any right to but himself.”<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>2.<br />
The arguments made by both Rothard and Hoppe, in the Appendix, below,
rejecting the only two possible alternatives to self-ownership: the
“communist” alternative of Universal and Equal Other-ownership, which is
unworkable and would lead to the death of the human race; and
other-ownership (slavery, domination), which is not universalizable.</p>
<p>3.<br />
The prior-later distinction, noted above (see notes 6, 7): It is
difficult to deny that a person has a claim to self-ownership based on
his direct control of his body. This is the objective link <em>par
excellence</em>. As Hoppe writes, “While I can cite in favor of my
property claim regarding my body the objective fact that I was the
body’s first occupant—its first user—anyone else who claims to have the
right to control this body can cite nothing of the sort.” (note 7,
above) Anyone claiming a right to enslave this person via indirect
control always comes along later. Indirect control of a person is
impossible unless he is a person. When he becomes a person, his direct
control makes him the first owner of his body. The would-be enslaver is
thus a latecomer, in violation of the prior-later distinction. Thus, a
property norm assigning property rights in a latecoming-<br />
indirect controller cannot be justifiable since it would, like any
property norm violating the prior-later distinction, generate rather
than reduce conflict.</p>
<p>4.<br />
Related to the universalizability points made in point 2 above: human
actors who seek to own external resources presuppose they already own
their own bodies. This right did not come from homesteading, but is
based on some other reason (e.g., direct control). Thus, when the slaver
attempts to dominate and own another person, he must claim
self-ownership rights in himself—on <em>some</em> basis. Whatever the
basis for the would-be enslaver’s claim to self-ownership, he cannot
deny that similarly situated other persons do not have this same
right.</p>
<p>5.<br />
Perhaps most decisively, as Hoppe argues in previous work (quote at note
17, above), and as he emphasizes in a related comment in the Foreword:
“if body-ownership were assigned to some indirect body-controller,
<em>conflict would become unavoidable</em> as the direct body-controller
cannot give up the direct control over his body as long as he is alive.”
As I discuss also in chapter 7 (note 35, text following note 36), what
Hoppe is pointing out here is that assigning ownership over a person
(the direct body-controller) to an enslaver (the indirect
body-controller), <em>necessarily generates conflict</em> because the
enslaved person maintains his direct control over his body—as Rothbard
points out, his will remains “inalienable” (see chapter 9, Part III.C).
In other words, direct control has priority as compared to any indirect
control, since otherwise conflict is unavoidable, contrary to the
<em>very purpose</em> of property norms. A norm that generates conflict
cannot be considered a property norm aimed at reducing conflict, and
thus cannot be justified. For this reason, direct control has
logical-temporal precedence over indirect control, and the only
justified property norm is self-ownership.<a href="#fn117"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="returning-to-the-child"><em>Returning to the Child</em></h4>
<p>So, who owns a child’s body? We may say that initially, before the
child has rights (say, as a very early stage fetus), the mother owns the
growing fetus that is part of her body and that was produced by her
body.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a> Once the child is recognized as
having rights, the child owns his own body because of his direct control
over it, but the parents serve as presumptive guardians who can make
decisions on the child’s behalf. (The presumption can be overcome if the
parents are abusive, meaning some other adults would be selected as the
guardians/parents.) When the child reaches a sufficient level of
maturity, he or she becomes an adult, so to speak, and the parents’
guardianship ends. <a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoppe recognized this basic conclusion in his 1989 treatise, where he
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is worth mentioning that <em>the ownership right stemming from
production finds its natural limitation only when, as in the case of
children, the thing produced is itself another actor-producer. According
to the natural theory of property, a child, once born, is just as much
the owner of his own body as anyone else.</em> Hence, not only can a
child expect not to be physically aggressed against but as the owner of
his body a child has the right, in particular, to abandon his parents
once he is physically able to run away from them and say “no” to their
possible attempts to recapture him. Parents only have special rights
regarding their child—stemming from their unique status as the child’s
producers—insofar as they (and no one else) can rightfully claim to be
the child’s trustee as long as the child is physically unable to run
away and say “no.”<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Hoppe adopts the Rothbardian approach, which uses the child’s
capacity to run away and say “no” as a sort of rule of thumb for
indicating when a child fully appropriates his body.<a href="#fn121"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a>
But a more general conception of body-appropriation may be developed by
considering the following. First, as Hoppe emphasizes, to appropriate
means to <em>bring under control</em>.<a href="#fn122"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoppe also argues that rights are held by <em>rational
agents</em>—those who are “capable of communicating, discussing,
arguing, and in particular, [who are] <em>able to engage in an
argumentation of normative problems</em>.”<a href="#fn123"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a>
This implies that a person reaches adulthood, or “appropriates” his body
and gains full ownership rights to it, when he reaches the point where
he is a rational agent in this sense. (The act of gaining full
self-ownership rights may be regarded as a type of homesteading or
appropriation of one’s body—reaching adulthood, so to speak—so long as
it is kept in mind that it is a special type of homesteading: not
homesteading <em>by</em> a body-owner <em>of</em> an <em>unowned</em>
(non-agent) resource, but the establishment of an objective link
constituted by direct and immediate control of the body by a rational
agent. The child becomes a full self-owner or body-owner, when he
reaches sufficient rational agency to be rights-bearing and independent,
<em>because</em> he has direct control over his body. It is the union of
these two characteristics that gives him a proprietary right over his
body: rational agency + direct control. Animals also have direct control
over their bodies but can be owned because they have no rational agency,
that is, no rights. Both characteristics are needed for the young human
to become a self-owning adult, so to speak.)</p>
<p>Obviously, there are other issues that could be explored here: when
and exactly how does a child homestead himself, or reach adulthood; and
exceptions to the <em>prima facie</em> case, such as where a person
commits a crime which in some sense severs his objective link or
transfers it to his victim (creating a “superior” link on behalf of the
victim), so that the victim has the right to retaliate. But it should be
clear that what distinguishes libertarianism from all competing
political theories is its scrupulous adherence—informed by sound, i.e.,
Austrian, economics—to the idea that property rights in scarce resources
must be assigned to the person with the best objective link to the
resource in question; and that, in the case of bodies, the link is the
natural connection to and relationship between the occupant and the
body, while for all other resources, the objective link is first use and
contractual transfer.</p>
<h4
id="appendix-direct-control-and-objective-links"><strong>APPENDIX</strong>
DIRECT CONTROL AND OBJECTIVE LINKS</h4>
<p>As noted above, the material here was originally intended to appear
in footnote 14, above. Due to its length, I include this material in
this appendix.</p>
<p>In the text above, I noted that “first use” is not the ultimate test
for the “objective link” in the case of body ownership, but that rather
it is a person’s <em>direct and immediate control</em> over his body.
See also, on this, Rothbard, who argues in favor of self-ownership
because the only logical alternatives are “(1) the ‘communist’ one of
Universal and Equal Other-ownership, or (2) Partial Ownership of One
Group by Another—a system of rule by one class over another.”<a
href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a> However, Alternative (2) cannot be
universal, as it is partial and arbitrary; and Alternative (1) either
breaks down in practice and reduces to Alternative (2), or, if actually
implemented, would result in the death of the human race. As Rothbard
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we picture a world in which <em>no</em> man is free to take
<em>any</em> action whatsoever without prior approval by <em>everyone
else</em> in society? Clearly no man would be able to do anything, and
the human race would quickly perish. But if a world of zero or near-zero
self-ownership spells death for the human race, then any steps in that
direction also contravene the law of what is best for man and his life
on earth.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe also writes on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a person A were <em>not</em> the owner of his own body and the
places and goods originally appropriated and/or produced with this body
as well as of the goods voluntarily (contractually) acquired from
another previous owner, then only two alternatives exist. Either
<em>another</em> person B must be recognized as the owner of A’s body as
well as the places and goods appropriated, produced or acquired by A, or
else <em>all</em> persons, A and B, must be considered equal co-owners
of all bodies, places and goods.</p>
<p>In the first case, A would be reduced to the rank of B’s slave and
object of exploitation…. such a ruling must be discarded as a human
ethic equally applicable to everyone qua human being (rational animal).
From the very outset, any such ruling can be recognized as not
universally acceptable and thus cannot claim to represent law. For a
rule to aspire to the rank of a law—a <em>just</em> rule—it is necessary
that such a rule apply equally and universally to everyone.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in the second case of universal and equal
co-ownership, the requirement of equal law for everyone is fulfilled.
However, this alternative suffers from another even more severe
deficiency, for if it were applied, all of mankind would instantly
perish. (And since every human ethic must permit the survival of
mankind, this alternative must be rejected.)</p>
<p>… This insight into the praxeological impossibility of “universal
communism,” as Rothbard referred to this proposal, brings us immediately
to an alternative way of demonstrating the idea of original
appropriation and private property as the only correct solution to the
problem of social order.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in another work, Hoppe adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is wrong with this idea of dropping the prior-later distinction
as morally irrelevant? First, if the late-comers, i.e., those who did
not in fact do something with some scarce goods, had indeed as much of a
right to them as the first-comers, i.e., those who did do something with
the scarce goods, then literally no one would be allowed to do anything
with anything, as one would have to have all of the late-comers’ consent
prior to doing whatever one wanted to do. Indeed, as posterity would
include one’s children’s children—people, that is, who come so late that
one could never possibly ask them—advocating a legal system that does
not make use of the prior-later distinction as part of its underlying
property theory is simply absurd in that it implies <em>advocating
death</em> but must presuppose life to advocate anything. Neither we,
our forefathers, nor our progeny could, do, or will survive and say or
argue anything if one were to follow this rule. In order for any
person—past, present, or future—to argue anything it <em>must be
possible to survive now</em>. Nobody can wait and suspend acting until
everyone of an indeterminate class of late-comers happens to appear and
agree to what one wants to do. Rather, insofar as a person finds himself
alone, he must be able to act, to use, produce, consume goods
straightaway, prior to any agreement with people who are simply not
around yet (and perhaps never will be).<a href="#fn127"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marxist philosopher G.A. Cohen acknowledges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>people can do (virtually) nothing without using parts of the external
world. If, then, they require the leave of the community to use it,
then, effectively…, they do not own themselves, since they can do
nothing without communal authorization.<a href="#fn128"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding this remark by Cohen, libertarian philosopher Jan Narveson
comments: “It is testimony to the strength of our position that even
someone so ideologically opposed gives it clear recognition as an
argument that must be confronted.”<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>John Locke also rejected the idea that people can only use unowned
resources by getting the consent of everyone else as absurd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By making an explicit consent of every commoner, necessary to any
one’s appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common,
children or servants could not cut the meat, which their father or
master had provided for them in common, without assigning to every one
his peculiar part.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a point related to those mentioned above, see Hoppe, in the
Foreword:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[It is] clear what a human ethic or a theory of justice worth its
salt must accomplish. It must give an answer to the question of what am
I and what is every other person permitted (or not permitted) to do,
right now and right here, wherever a person may find himself and
whatever his external surroundings of men and materials may be.</p>

<h4 id="i.-introduction">I. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Punishment serves many purposes. It can deter crime and prevent the
offender from committing further crimes. It can even rehabilitate some
criminals—except, of course, if it is capital punishment. It can satisfy
a victim’s longing for revenge or a relative’s desire to avenge.
Punishment can also be used as a lever to obtain restitution or
rectification for some of the damage caused by the crime. For these
reasons, the issue of punishment is and always has been a vital concern
to civilized people. They want to know the effects of punishment and
effective ways of carrying it out.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>Civilized people are also concerned about <em>justifying</em>
punishment. They want to punish, but they also want to know that such
punishment is justified. They want to be able to punish
legitimately—hence the interest in punishment theories.<a href="#fn133"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a>
As pointed out by Murray Rothbard in his short but insightful discussion
of punishment and proportionality, however, the theory of punishment has
not been adequately developed, even by libertarians.<a href="#fn134"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>In conventional theories of punishment, concepts of restitution,
deterrence,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> retribution, and rehabilitation
are often forwarded as justifications for punishment, even though they
are really the effects or purposes of punishment.<a href="#fn136"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a>
This reversal of logic is not surprising given the consequentialist,
result-oriented type of thinking that is so prevalent nowadays.
Nevertheless, the effects of punishment or the uses to which it might be
put do not justify punishment.</p>
<p>Take the analogous case of free speech rights as an example.
Modern-day liberals and other consequentialists typically seek to
justify the First Amendment right to free speech on the grounds that
free speech promotes political discourse.<a href="#fn137"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a>
But, as libertarians—the most systematic and coherent school of modern
political philosophy and the contemporary heirs of the classical liberal
Founding Fathers—have explained, there is a right to free speech simply
because it does not involve aggression against others, not because it
“promotes political discussion.”<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>This analogy highlights the fact that the purpose to which a right
holder might put the right is not necessarily what justifies the right
in the first place. Turning back to punishment, if individuals have a
right to punish, the purpose for which a person exercises this right—for
example, for revenge, for restitution, or for deterrence—and the
consequences that flow from it may well be irrelevant to the question of
whether the right claimed can be justified.<a href="#fn139"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>In this chapter I will attempt to explain how and why punishment can
be justified. The right to punish discussed herein applies to property
crimes such as theft and trespass as well as to bodily-invasive crimes
such as assault, rape, and murder. I will develop a retributionist, or
<em>lex talionis</em>, theory of punishment, including related
principles of proportionality. This theory of punishment is largely
consistent with the libertarian-based <em>lex talionis</em> approach of
Murray Rothbard.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a> I will not follow the approach of
some theorists who derive principles of punishment from a theory of
rights or from some other ethical or utilitarian theory. Instead, I will
follow the opposite approach in which justifying punishment itself
defines and justifies our rights.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="ii.-punishment-and-consent">II. PUNISHMENT AND CONSENT</h4>
<p>What does it mean to punish? Dictionary definitions are easy to come
by, but in the sense that interests those of us who want to punish,
punishment is the infliction of physical force on a person in response
to something that the person has done or has failed to do.<a
href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a> Thus, punishment comprises
physical violence committed against a person’s body, against any
property (resource) that a person legitimately owns, or against any
rights that a person has.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> It is a <em>use
of</em> someone’s body or owned resource without their
currently-expressed consent, that is, over their expressed objection.
Punishment is distinct from aggression, in that it is <em>for</em>, or
<em>in response to</em>, some action, inaction, feature, or status of
the person punished; otherwise, it is simply random violence or
aggression, unconnected with some previous action or inaction of the one
punished.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a> Naked aggression against an
innocent victim is not punishment; it is simply aggression. When we
punish a person, it is because we consider that person to be a wrongdoer
of some sort. We typically want to teach that person or others a lesson
or exact vengeance or restitution for what that person has done.</p>
<p>If wrongdoers always consented to the infliction of punishment in
response to the perpetration of a crime or tort, we would not need to
justify punishment. It would be justified by the very consent of the
purported wrongdoer. As the Roman jurist Ulpian summarized this
commonsense insight centuries ago, “there is no affront [or injustice]
where the victim consents.”<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> The need to justify
punishment only arises when a person resists and refuses to consent to
being punished. As philosopher John Hospers notes, the very thing that
is troublesome about punishment “is that in punishing someone, we are
forcibly <em>imposing</em> on him something against his will, and of
which he may not approve.”<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>I will thus seek to justify punishment exactly where it needs to be
justified: the point at which we attempt to inflict punishment upon
people who oppose it. In short, I will argue that society may justly
punish those who have initiated force, in a manner proportionate to
their initiation of force and to the consequences thereof, because they
cannot coherently object to such punishment. In brief, it makes no sense
for them to object to punishment because this requires that they
maintain that the infliction of force is unjustified, which is
contradictory because they intentionally initiated force themselves.
Thus, they are dialogically <em>estopped</em>, to use related legal
terminology, or precluded, from denying the legitimacy of their being
punished and from withholding their consent.<a href="#fn147"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a>
As argued below, this reasoning may be used to develop a theory of
punishment and rights.</p>
<h4 id="iii.-punishment-and-estoppel">III. PUNISHMENT AND ESTOPPEL</h4>
<h5 id="a.-legal-estoppel">A. Legal Estoppel</h5>
<p>Estoppel is a well-known common law principle that prevents or
precludes someone from making a legal claim that is inconsistent with
prior conduct if some other person has changed position detrimentally in
reliance on the prior conduct (referred to as “detrimental reliance”).<a
href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a> Estoppel thus denies a party the
ability to assert a fact or right that the party otherwise could.
Estoppel is a widely applicable legal principle that has countless
manifestations.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> Roman law and its modern heir, the
civil law, contain the similar doctrine “<em>venire contra proprium
factum</em>,” or “no one can contradict his own act.”<a href="#fn150"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a>
Under this principle, “no one is allowed to ignore or deny his own acts,
or the consequences thereof, and claim a right in opposition to such
acts or consequences.”<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a> Estoppel may even be
applied if a person’s silent acquiescence in the face of a duty to speak
amounts to a representation.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> The principle behind
estoppel can also be seen in common sayings such as “actions speak
louder than words,” “practice what you preach,” and “put your money
where your mouth is,” all of which embody the idea that actions and
assertions should be consistent.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a> As Lord Coke stated,
the word “estoppel” is used “because a man’s own act or acceptance
stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth.”<a
href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"

<p>For legal estoppel to operate, there usually must have been
detrimental reliance by the person seeking to estop another.<a
href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a> Proof of detrimental reliance is
required because until a person has relied on another’s prior action or
representation, the action or representation has not caused any harm,
and thus, there is no reason to estop the actor from asserting the truth
or from rejecting the prior conduct.<a href="#fn156"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>As an example, in the recent case <em>Zimmerman v. Zimmerman</em>, a
daughter sued her father for tuition fee debts she had incurred during
her second and third years at college.<a href="#fn157"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a>
In this case, when the daughter was a senior in high school, the father
promised to pay her tuition fees and related expenses if she attended a
local college (Adelphi University). However, the promise was a “mere”
promise, because it was not accompanied by the requisite legal
formalities such as consideration, and therefore did not constitute a
normally binding contract. Nevertheless, during her first year at
college, her father paid her tuition for her, as he had promised.
However, he failed to pay her tuition during the second and third years,
although he repeatedly assured her during this time that he would pay
the tuition fees when he had the money. This resulted in the daughter’s
legal obligation to pay approximately $6,700 to Adelphi. In this case,
although the promise itself did not give rise to an enforceable contract
(because of lack of legal formalities such as consideration), it was
found that the father should have reasonably expected that his daughter
would rely on his promise, and that she did in fact rely on the promise,
taking substantial action to her detriment or disadvantage (namely,
incurring a debt to Adelphi). Therefore, the daughter was awarded an
amount sufficient to cover the unpaid tuition. The father was, in
effect, estopped from denying that a contract was formed, even though
one was not.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"

<h5 id="b.-dialogical-estoppel">B. Dialogical Estoppel</h5>
<p>As can be seen, the heart of the idea behind legal estoppel is
consistency. A similar concept, “dialogical estoppel,” can be used to
justify the libertarian conception of rights because of the reciprocity
inherent in the libertarian tenet that force is legitimate only in
response to force and because of the consistency that must apply to
aggressors trying to argue why they should not be punished.<a
href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a> The basic insight behind this
theory of rights is that people who initiate force cannot consistently
object to being punished. They are dialogically, so to speak, “estopped”
from asserting the impropriety of the force used to punish them because
of their own coercive behavior. This theory also establishes the
validity of the libertarian conception of rights as being strictly
negative rights against aggression.</p>
<p>The point at which punishment needs to be justified is when we
attempt to inflict punishment upon a person who opposes it. Thus, using
a philosophical, generalized version of dialogical estoppel, I want to
justify punishment in just this situation by showing that an aggressor
is estopped from objecting to punishment. Under the principle of
dialogical estoppel, or simply “estoppel,” a person is estopped from
making certain claims during discourse if these claims are inconsistent
and contradictory. To say that a person is estopped from making certain
claims means that the claims cannot possibly be right because they are
contradictory. It is to recognize that his assertion is simply wrong
because it is contradictory.</p>
<p>Applying estoppel in this manner perfectly complements the purpose of
dialogue. Dialogue, discourse, or argument—terms that are used
interchangeably herein—is by its nature an activity aimed at finding
truth. Anyone engaged in argument is necessarily endeavoring to discern
the truth about some particular subject; otherwise, there is no dialogue
occurring but mere babbling or even physical fighting. This cannot be
denied. Any person arguing long enough to deny that truth is the goal of
discourse contradicts this denial because that person is asserting or
challenging the truth of a given proposition. Thus, asserting that
something is true that cannot be true is incompatible with the purpose
of discourse. Anything that clearly cannot be true is contrary to the
truth-finding purpose of discourse and, consequently, is impermissible
within the bounds of the discourse.</p>
<p>Contradictions are certainly the archetype of propositions that
cannot be true. A and not-A cannot both be true simultaneously and in
the same respect.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> This is why participants in
discourse must be consistent. If an arguer does not need to be
consistent, truth-finding cannot occur. And just as the traditional
legal theory of estoppel mandates a sort of consistency in a legal
context, the more general use of estoppel can be used to require
consistency in discourse. The theory of estoppel that<br />
I propose is nothing more than a convenient way to apply the requirement
of consistency to arguers—those engaged in discourse, dialogue, debate,
discussion, or argumentation. Because discourse is a truth-finding
activity, any such contradictory claims should be disregarded since they
cannot possibly be true. Dialogical estoppel is thus a rule of discourse
that rejects any inconsistent, mutually contradictory claims because
they are contrary to the very goal of discourse. This rule is based
solely on the recognition that discourse is a truth-seeking activity and
that contradictions, which are necessarily untrue, are incompatible with
discourse and thus should not be allowed.<a href="#fn161"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a>
The validity of this rule is undeniable because it is necessarily
presupposed by any participant in discourse.</p>
<p>There are various ways that contradictions can arise in discourse.
First, an arguer’s position might be explicitly inconsistent. For
example, if a person states that A is true and that not-A is also true,
there is no doubt that the person is incorrect. After all, as Ayn Rand
repeatedly emphasized, A is A; the law of identity is indeed valid and
unchallengeable.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a> It is impossible for him<a
href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a> to coherently and intelligibly
assert that two contradictory statements are true; it is impossible for
these claims to both be true. Thus, he is estopped from asserting them
and is not heard to utter them because they cannot tend to establish the
truth, which is the goal of all argumentation.<a href="#fn164"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a>
As Wittgenstein noted, “What we cannot speak about we must pass over in
silence.”<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>An arguer’s position can also be inconsistent without explicitly
maintaining that A and not-A are true. Indeed, rarely will an arguer
assert both A and not-A explicitly. However, whenever an arguer states
that A is true, and also necessarily holds that not-A is true, the
inconsistency is still there, and he is still estopped from explicitly
claiming that A is true and implicitly claiming that not-A is true. The
reason is the same as above: he cannot possibly be right that explicit A
and implicit not-A are both true. Now he might, in some cases, be able
to remove the inconsistency by dropping one of the claims. For example,
suppose he asserts that the concept of gross national product is
meaningful and a minute later states the exact opposite, apparently
contradicting the earlier assertion. To avoid inconsistency, he can
disclaim the earlier statement, thereby necessarily maintaining that the
previous statement was incorrect. But it is not always possible to drop
one of the assertions if it is unavoidably presupposed as true by the
arguer. For example, the speaker might argue that he never argues.
However, since he is currently arguing, he must necessarily, at least
implicitly, hold or recognize that he sometimes argues. We would not
recognize the contradictory claims as permissible in the argument
because contradictions are untrue. The speaker would be estopped from
maintaining these two contradictory claims, one explicit and one
implicit, and he could not drop the second claim—that he sometimes
argues—for he cannot help but hold this view while engaged in
argumentation itself. To maintain an arguable—that is, possibly
true—position, he would have to renounce the first claim that he never
argues.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if this person was so incoherent as to argue that he
somehow does not believe or recognize that arguing is possible, despite
engaging in it, he would still be estopped from asserting that
argumentation is impossible. For even if he does not actually
<em>realize</em> that argumentation is possible—or, what is more likely,
does not actually admit it—it still cannot be the case that
argumentation is impossible if someone is indeed arguing.</p>
<p>We know this to be true whether or not others admit or recognize
this. Thus, if someone asserts that argumentation is impossible, this
assertion contradicts the undeniable presupposition of
argumentation—that argumentation <em>is</em> possible. This person’s
proposition is facially untrue. Again, the person would be estopped from
asserting such a claim since it is not even possibly true; the assertion
flies in the face of undeniably true facts of reality.</p>
<p>Thus, because dialogue is a truth-finding activity, participants are
estopped from making explicitly contradictory assertions since they
subvert the goal of truth-seeking by being necessarily false. For the
same reason, arguers are estopped from asserting one thing if (1) it
contradicts something else that they necessarily maintain to be true;
(2) it contradicts something that is necessarily true because it is a
presupposition of discourse; or (3) it is necessarily true as an
undeniable feature of reality or human existence. Further, no one can
disagree with these general conclusions without self-contradiction, for
anyone disagreeing with anything is a participant in discourse and,
therefore, necessarily values truth-finding and consistency.</p>
<h5 id="c.-punishing-aggressive-behavior">C. Punishing Aggressive
Behavior</h5>
<p>The conduct of individuals can be divided into two types: (1)
coercive or aggressive—that is, the initiation of force—and (2)
noncoercive or nonaggressive. This division is purely descriptive and
does not presume that aggression is invalid, immoral, or unjustifiable.
It only assumes that at least some human action can be objectively
classified as either aggressive or nonaggressive.<a href="#fn166"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a>
Thus, there are two types of behavior for which we might attempt to
punish a person: aggressive and nonaggressive.<a href="#fn167"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a>
I will examine each in turn to show that punishment of aggressive
behavior is legitimate while punishment of nonaggressive behavior is
illegitimate.</p>
<p>The clearest and most severe instance of aggression is murder, so let
us take this as an example. In what follows I will assume that the
victim <em>B</em>, or <em>B</em>’s agent, <em>C</em>, attempts to punish
a purported wrongdoer <em>A</em>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a> Suppose that
<em>A</em> murders <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em> convicts and imprisons
<em>A</em>. In order for <em>A</em> to object to his punishment,
<em>A</em> must claim that <em>C</em> should not and must not treat him
this way; that he has a <em>right</em><a href="#fn169"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>169</sup></a>
to not be punished or, at least, that the use of force is <em>wrong</em>
so that <em>C</em> should, therefore, not punish him.<a href="#fn170"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a>
However, such a claim is blatantly inconsistent with what must be
<em>A</em>’s other position: because <em>A</em> murdered <em>B</em>,
which is clearly an act of aggression, his actions have indicated that
he also holds the view that “aggression is <em>not</em> wrong.”</p>
<p>Thus, because of his earlier actions, <em>A</em> is estopped from
claiming that aggression is wrong.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref171" role="doc-noteref"><sup>171</sup></a> He cannot assert
contradictory claims and is estopped from doing so. The only way for
<em>A</em> to maintain consistency is to drop one of his claims. If
<em>A</em> retains only the claim “aggression is proper,” then he is
failing to object to his imprisonment; thus, the question of justifying
the punishment does not arise. By claiming that aggression is proper,
<em>A</em> consents to his punishment. If, on the other hand, <em>A</em>
drops his claim that “aggression is proper” and retains only his claim
that “aggression is wrong,” he indeed could object to his imprisonment.
As we shall see below, it is impossible for him to drop the claim that
“aggression is proper” just as it would be impossible for him to avoid
maintaining that he exists or that he can argue.</p>
<p>To restate, <em>A</em> cannot consistently claim that murder is
wrong, for it contradicts his view that murder is <em>not</em> wrong,
evidenced by or made manifest in his previous act of murder. <em>A</em>
is estopped from asserting such inconsistent claims. Therefore, if
<em>C</em> attempts to kill <em>A</em>, <em>A</em> has no grounds for
objecting since he cannot now say that such a killing by <em>C</em> is
“wrong,” “immoral,” or “improper” or that it would violate his “rights.”
And if <em>A</em> cannot complain if <em>C</em> proposes to kill him,
then, <em>a fortiori</em>, he surely cannot complain if <em>C</em>
merely imprisons him.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a> Thus, we can legitimately apply
force to—punish—a murderer in response to the crime. (And of course, if
an aggressor may be punished after the fact, force used in self-defense
is, <em>a fortiori</em>, obviously justified.)<a href="#fn173"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the essence of rights is their legitimate enforceability,
this establishes a right to life—that is, to not be murdered. It is easy
to see how this example may be extended to less severe forms of
aggression, such as assault and battery, kidnapping, and rape.<a
href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="d.-potential-defenses-by-the-aggressor">D. Potential Defenses by
the Aggressor</h5>
<p><em>A</em> might assert several possible objections to this whole
procedure. None of them bear scrutiny, however.</p>
<h6 id="the-concept-of-aggression">1. The Concept of Aggression</h6>
<p>First, <em>A</em> might claim that the classification of actions as
either aggressive or not aggressive is invalid. We might be smuggling in
a norm or value judgment just by describing murder as “aggressive”
rather than merely describing the murder without evaluative overtones.
This smuggled norm might be what apparently justifies the legitimacy of
punishing <em>A</em>, thus making the justification circular and,
therefore, faulty. However, in order to object to our punishment of him,
<em>A</em> must admit the validity of describing some actions as
forceful—namely, his imminent punishment. If he denies that any actions
can be objectively described as being coercive, he has no grounds to
object to imprisonment, for he cannot even be certain what constitutes
punishment, and we may proceed to punish him. The moment he objects to
this use of force, he cannot help admitting that at least some actions
can be objectively classified as involving force. Thus, he is estopped
from objecting on these grounds.</p>
<h6 id="universalizability">2. Universalizability</h6>
<p>It could also be objected that the estoppel principle is being
improperly applied and that <em>A</em> is not, in fact, asserting
inconsistent claims. Instead of having the contradictory views that
“aggression is proper” and “aggression is improper,” <em>A</em> could
claim to hold the consistent positions that “<em>aggression by me</em>
is proper” and “aggression by others against me is improper.” However,
we must recall that <em>A</em>, in objecting to <em>C</em>’s
imprisonment of him, is engaging in argument. He is arguing that
<em>C</em> <em>should not</em>—for some good reason—imprison him, and so
he is making normative assertions. But as Professor Hans-Hermann Hoppe
points out:</p>
<p>Quite commonly it has been observed that argumentation implies that a
proposition claims <em>universal</em> acceptability, or, should it be a
norm proposal, that it is “universalizable.” Applied to norm proposals,
this is the idea, as formulated in the Golden Rule of ethics or in the
Kantian Categorical Imperative, that only those norms can be justified
that can be formulated as general principles which are valid for
everyone without exception.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref175" role="doc-noteref"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<p>This is so because propositions made during argumentation claim
universal acceptability. “[I]t is implied in argumentation that everyone
who can understand an argument must in principle be able to be convinced
by it simply because of its argumentative force…”<a href="#fn176"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176" role="doc-noteref"><sup>176</sup></a>
Thus, universalizability is a presupposition of normative discourse, and
any arguer violating the principle of universalizability is maintaining
inconsistent positions—that universalizability is required and that it
is not—and is thus estopped from doing so. Only universalizable
normative propositions are consistent with the principle of
universalizability necessarily presupposed by the arguer in entering the
discourse. As Hare points out:</p>
<p>Offenses against the thesis of universalizability are logical, not
moral. If a person says ‘I ought to act in a certain way, but nobody
else ought to act in that way in relevantly similar circumstances’, then
... he is abusing the word ‘ought’ he is implicitly contradicting
himself.… [A]ll [the thesis of universalizability] does is to force
people to choose between judgements which cannot both be asserted
without self-contradiction.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref177" role="doc-noteref"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<p>The proper way, then, to select the norm that the arguer is asserting
is to ensure that it is universalizable. The view that “aggression
<em>by me</em> is proper” and “aggression by the state against me is
improper” clearly does not pass this test. The view that “aggression is
or is not proper” is, by contrast, perfectly universalizable and is thus
the proper form for a norm. An arguer cannot escape the application of
estoppel by arbitrarily specializing otherwise inconsistent views with
liberally sprinkled “for me only’s.”<a href="#fn178"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>178</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, even if <em>A</em> denies the validity of the principle
of universalizability and maintains that he can particularize norms, he
cannot object if <em>C</em> does the same. If <em>A</em> admits that
norms may be particularized, <em>C</em> may simply act on the particular
norm that “It is permissible to punish <em>A</em>.”</p>
<h6 id="time">3. Time</h6>
<p><em>A</em> could also attempt to rebut this application of estoppel
by claiming that he, in fact, <em>does</em> currently maintain that
aggression is improper and that he has changed his mind since the time
when <em>B</em> was murdered. Thus, there is no inconsistency or
contradiction because he does not simultaneously hold both contradictory
ideas and is not estopped from objecting to imprisonment.<a
href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>But this is a simple matter to overcome. First, <em>A</em> is
implicitly claiming that the passage of time should be taken into
account when determining what actions to impute to him. But then, if
this is true, all <em>C</em> needs to do is administer the punishment
and afterwards assert that all is in the past and that <em>C</em>, like
<em>A</em>, now condemns its prior action. Since the impermissible
action is “in the past,” it can no longer be imputed to <em>C</em>.
Indeed, if such an absurd simultaneity requirement is operative, at
every successive moment of the punishment, any objection or defensive
action by <em>A</em> is directed at actions in the immediate past and
thus become immediately irrelevant and past-directed. Therefore, the
irrelevance of the mere passage of time cannot be denied by
<em>A</em>,<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>180</sup></a> for in order to effectively object
to being punished, <em>A</em> must presume that the passage of time does
not make a difference to imputing responsibility-incurring actions to
individuals.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, in objecting to punishment in the present, <em>A</em>
necessarily maintains that force must not and should not occur. Even if
he really does no longer believe that murder is proper, by his own
current view, the earlier murder was still improper. He necessarily
denounces his earlier actions and is estopped from objecting to his
punishment imposed on that murderer—namely, himself. To maintain that a
murderer should not be punished is inconsistent with a claim that murder
should not and must not occur.</p>
<p>Third, even if <em>A</em> argues that he never held the view that
“murder is not wrong” and that he murdered despite holding it to be
wrong,<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a> he still admits that murder is
wrong and that he, in fact, did murder <em>B</em> and still ends up
denouncing his earlier action. Thus, <em>A</em> is again estopped from
objecting to the punishment as in the situation where he claims to have
changed his mind. Finally, if <em>A</em> maintains that it is possible
to administer force while simultaneously holding it to be wrong, the
same applies to <em>C</em>. So even if <em>C</em> is convinced by
<em>A</em>’s argument that it would be wrong to punish <em>A</em>,
<em>C</em> may go ahead and do so despite this realization, just as
<em>A</em> himself claims to have done.<a href="#fn183"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183" role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a>
Thus, whether <em>A</em> currently holds both views, or only one of
them, he is still estopped from objecting to the imprisonment.</p>
<p>Thus, we can see that applying the principle of estoppel would not
hinder the prevention and punishment of violent crimes. The above murder
analysis can be applied to any sort of coercive, violent crime. All the
classical violent crimes would still be as preventable under the
proposed scheme as they are today. All forms of aggression—rape, theft,
murder, assault, trespass—would still be legitimately punishable crimes.
A rapist, for example, could only complain about being imprisoned by
saying that his rights are being violated by the aggressive
imprisonment, but he would be estopped from saying that aggression is
wrong. In general, any aggressive act—one involving the initiation of
violence—would cause an inconsistency with the actor later claiming that
he should not be imprisoned or punished in some manner.</p>
<h5 id="e.-punishing-nonaggressive-behavior">E. Punishing Nonaggressive
Behavior</h5>
<p>As seen above, punishment of aggression can be justified because the
use of force in response to force cannot sensibly be condemned as a
violation of the rights of the original aggressor. Is it ever legitimate
to punish someone for <em>non</em>aggressive behavior? If not, then this
means that rights can only be negative rights against the initiation of
force. As argued below, no such punishment is ever justified because
punishment is the application of force to which a person is not estopped
from objecting unless that person has initiated force. Otherwise, there
is no inconsistency. Thus, nonaggressive force, consented-to force, and
actions not involving force may not be punished.</p>
<p>First, a nonaggressive use of force, such as retaliation against
aggression, cannot be justly punished. If someone were to attempt to
punish <em>B</em> for retaliating against aggressor <em>A</em>,
<em>B</em> is <em>not</em> estopped from objecting. There is nothing
inconsistent or nonuniversalizable about maintaining both that (1) the
use of retaliatory force in response to the initiation of force is
proper—the implicit claim involved in retaliation against <em>A</em>—and
(2) the use of force not in response to the initiation of force is
improper—the basis for <em>B</em>’s objection to his own punishment. In
short, the initiation of force is different from retaliatory force;
retaliation is not aggression. <em>B</em> can easily show that the maxim
of his action is “the use of force against an aggressor is legitimate,”
which does not contradict “the use of force against nonaggressors is
illegitimate.” Rather than being a particularizable claim that does not
pass the universalizability test, <em>B</em>’s position is tailored to
the actual nature of his prior action. The universalizability principle
prevents only arbitrary, biased statements not grounded in the nature of
things.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>184</sup></a> Thus, the mere use of force is not
enough to estop someone from complaining about being punished for the
use of force. It is only aggression, that is, <em>initiated</em> force,
that estops a person from complaining about force used against that
person.</p>
<p>Similarly, if <em>A</em> uses force against <em>B</em> with
<em>B</em>’s permission, <em>A</em> is not an aggressor and thus may not
be punished. <em>A</em> may consistently assert that “using force
against someone is permissible if they have consented” and that “using
force against someone is impermissible if they have not consented.” For
example, suppose that <em>A</em> slaps <em>B</em> after <em>B</em> has
given consent. Is <em>A</em> estopped from objecting if <em>B</em>
attempts to slap him back? Obviously, <em>A</em> is not estopped because
he may consistently assert that “slapping someone is permissible if they
have consented” and that “slapping someone is impermissible if they have
not consented.” These are not inconsistent statements, and neither is
barred by the universalizability principle because it rests on the
recognition that the nature of a consented-to act is different than one
objected to. Thus, although uninvited physical force estops the
initiator thereof from complaining of punishment, invited or
consented-to physical force does not.</p>
<p>Other actions do not involve force or aggression at all, so there is
no ground for punishing this behavior either. Suppose publisher
<em>P</em> publishes a patently pornographic magazine, and some entity,
such as the state, punishes him for this by conviction and imprisonment.
Clearly, the state has committed naked aggression against him. Following
the analysis of Part III.C, unless <em>P</em> is estopped from
complaining about the punishment, the state itself may be punished,
demonstrating that it has violated his rights. <a href="#fn185"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p><em>P</em> has only published pornography, which is not aggression;
he has not engaged in any activity nor necessarily made any claim that
would be inconsistent with claiming that aggression is wrong. Thus, it
is not inconsistent to simultaneously maintain that (1) it is legitimate
to publish pornography and (2) it is illegitimate to aggress against a
person. <em>P</em> is not estopped from complaining about his
confinement.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike the case of retaliation against aggression, however, the state
has not administered force in response to <em>P</em>’s initiation of
force and is estopped from objecting to the proposed use of force
against it. The state’s punishment of <em>P</em> is, therefore, not
legitimate. Thus, it can be seen that punishment of any nonaggressive
behavior is illegitimate and unjustified, as are laws prohibiting such
behavior, since laws are themselves backed by and manifestations of
force.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="f.-property-rights">F. Property Rights</h5>
<p>So far, the right to punish actors who initiate invasions of victims’
bodies has been established, which corresponds to a right in one’s own
body, or self-ownership. Although there is not space here to provide a
detailed justification for rights in scarce resources outside one’s
body—property rights—I will briefly outline such a justification in this
section. Because rights in one’s own body have been established,
property rights may be established by building on this base. This may be
done by pointing out that rights in one’s body are meaningless without
property rights and vice versa.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref188" role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, imagine that a thief admits that there are rights to
self-ownership but that there is no right to property. If this is true,
we can easily punish him simply by depriving him of external property,
namely food, air, or space in which to exist or move. Clearly, the
denial of his property through the use of force can physically harm his
body just as direct invasion of the borders of his body can. The
physical, bodily damage can be done fairly directly, for example, by
snatching every piece of food out of his hands until he dies—why not, if
there are no property rights? Or it can be done somewhat more indirectly
by infringing upon his ability to control and use the external world,
which is essential to his survival. Such property deprivation could
continue until his body is severely damaged—implying, since this is
tantamount to physical retaliation in its effect on him, that physical
retaliation in response to a property crime is permissible—or until he
objected to such treatment, thereby granting the validity of property
rights. Just as one can commit an act of aggression against another with
one’s body—for example, one’s fist—or with external property—a club,
gun, bomb, poison—so one’s self-ownership rights can be aggressed
against in a limitless variety of ways by affecting one’s property and
external environment.</p>
<p>Professor Hoppe’s “argumentation ethics” defense of individual rights
also shows that the right to homestead is implied in the right to
self-ownership. First, Hoppe establishes self-ownership by focusing on
propositions that cannot be denied in discourse in general.<a
href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a> Anyone engaging in argumentation
implicitly accepts the presupposed right of self-ownership of all
listeners and even potential listeners. Otherwise, the listener would
not be able to consider freely and accept or reject the proposed
argument.</p>
<p>Second, because participants in argumentation indisputably need to
use and control the scarce resources in the world to survive, and
because their scarcity makes conflict over their use possible, norms are
needed to determine the proper owner of these goods so as to avoid
conflict. This necessity for norms to avoid conflicts in the use of
scarce resources is itself undeniable by those engaged in
argumentation—which is to say, undeniable—because anyone who is alive in
the world and participating in the practical activity of argumentation
cannot deny the value of being able to control scarce resources or the
value of avoiding conflicts over such scarce resources. But there are
only two fundamental alternatives for acquiring rights in unowned
property: (1) by doing something with the property which no one else had
ever done before, such as the mixing of labor or homesteading; or (2) by
mere verbal declaration or decree. The second alternative is arbitrary
and cannot serve to avoid conflicts. Only the first alternative, that of
Lockean homesteading, establishes an objective link between a particular
person and a particular scarce resource; thus, no one can deny the
Lockean right to homestead unowned resources.</p>
<p>As Hoppe points out, since one’s body is itself a scarce resource, it
is “the <em>prototype</em> of a scarce good for the use of which
property rights, i.e. rights of exclusive ownership, somehow have to be
established, in order to avoid clashes.”<a href="#fn190"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190" role="doc-noteref"><sup>190</sup></a>
Thus, the right to homestead external scarce resources is implied in the
fact of self-ownership since “the specifications of the nonaggression
principle, conceived of as a special property norm referring to a
specific kind of good, must in fact already contain those of a
<em>general</em> theory of property.”<a href="#fn191"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191" role="doc-noteref"><sup>191</sup></a>
For these reasons, whether self-ownership is established by Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics or by the estoppel theory—both theories that focus
on the dynamics of discourse—such rights imply the Lockean right to
homestead, which no aggressor could deny any more than he could deny
that self-ownership rights are justified.</p>
<p>I will, for the remainder of this chapter, place property rights and
rights in one’s body on the same level, both warranting punishment for
their invasion. Thus, under the estoppel theory one who aggresses
against another’s body or against another’s external property is an
aggressor, plain and simple, who may be treated as such.</p>
<h4 id="iv.-types-of-punishments-and-the-burden-of-proof">IV. TYPES OF
PUNISHMENTS AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF</h4>
<h5 id="a.-proportional-punishment">A. Proportional Punishment</h5>
<p>Just because aggressors can legitimately be punished does not
necessarily mean that all concerns about proportionality may be dropped.
At first blush, if we focus only on the initiation of force itself, it
would seem that a victim could make a prima facie case that since the
aggressor initiated force—no matter how trivial—the victim is entitled
to use force against the aggressor, even including execution of the
aggressor. Suppose <em>A</em> uninvitedly slaps <em>B</em> lightly on
the cheek in response to a rude remark by <em>B</em>. Is <em>B</em>
entitled to execute <em>A</em> in return? <em>A</em>, it is true, has
initiated force, so how can he complain if force is to be used against
him? But <em>A</em> is not estopped from objecting to being killed.
<em>A</em> may, perfectly consistently, object to being killed since he
may maintain that it is wrong to kill. This in itself is not
inconsistent with <em>A</em>’s implicit view that it is legitimate to
lightly slap others. By sanctioning slapping, <em>A</em> does not
necessarily claim that killing is proper because usually—as in this
example—there is nothing about slapping that rises to the level of
killing.</p>
<p>It is proper to focus on the consequences of aggression in
determining to what extent an aggressor is estopped because the very
reason people object to aggression, or wish to punish aggressors for it,
is just because it has certain consequences.<a href="#fn192"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a>
Aggressive action, by physically interfering with the victim’s person,
is undesirable because, among other reasons, it can (1) cause pain or
injury; (2) interfere with the pursuit of goals in life; or (3) simply
create a risky, dangerous situation in which pain, injury, or violence
are more likely to result. Aggression interferes with one’s physical
control over one’s life, that is, over one’s own body and external
property.</p>
<p>Killing someone obviously brings about the most undesirable level of
these consequences. Merely slapping someone, by contrast, does not in
normal circumstances. A slap has relatively insignificant consequences
in all these respects. Thus, <em>A</em> does not necessarily claim that
aggressive killing is proper just because he slaps <em>B</em>. The
universalization requirement does not prevent him from reasonably
narrowing his implicit claim from the more severe “aggression is not
wrong” to the less severe “minor aggression, such as slapping someone,
is not wrong.” Thus, <em>B</em> would be justified in slapping
<em>A</em> back but not in killing <em>A</em>. I do not mean that
<em>B</em> is justified <em>only</em> in slapping <em>A</em> and no
more, but certainly <em>B</em> is justified at least in slapping
<em>A</em>, and is not justified in killing him; this would be murder.
These outside boundaries, at least, we know.</p>
<p>In general, while the universalization principle prevents arbitrary
particularization of claims—for example, adding “for me only’s”—it does
not rule out an objective, reasonable statement of the implicit claims
of the aggressor tailored to the actual nature of the aggression and its
necessary consequences and implications. For example, while it is true
that <em>A</em> has slapped <em>B</em>, he has not attempted to take
<em>B</em>’s life; thus, he has never necessarily claimed that “murder
is not wrong,” so he is not estopped from asserting that murder is
wrong.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>193</sup></a> Since a mere slapper is not
estopped from complaining about his imminent execution, he can
consistently object to being executed, which implies that <em>B</em>
would become a murderer if he were to kill <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>In this way, we can see a requirement of proportionality—or, more
properly, of reciprocity along the lines of the <em>lex talionis</em> or
the law of retaliation<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref194" role="doc-noteref"><sup>194</sup></a>—accompanies any
legitimate punishment of an aggressor. “As the injury inflicted, so must
be the injury suffered.”<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref195" role="doc-noteref"><sup>195</sup></a> There are, thus,
limitations to the amount of punishment the victim may administer to the
aggressor, related to the extent of the aggression committed by the
aggressor, because it is the nature of the particular act of aggression
that determines the extent of the estoppel working against the
aggressor. The more serious the aggression and the consequences that
flow from it, the more the aggressor is estopped from objecting to
punishment. Consequently, a greater level of punishment may legitimately
be applied.</p>
<h5 id="b.-the-victims-options">B. The Victim’s Options</h5>
<p>At this point, we have established the basic right to one’s body and
to property homesteaded or acquired from a homesteader, as well as the
contours of the basic requirement of proportionality in punishment. This
chapter now presents a further consideration of the various types of
punishment that can be justly administered.</p>
<p>As has been shown, a victim of aggression may inflict on the
aggressor at least the same level or type of aggression previously
inflicted by the aggressor. In determining the maximum amount and type
of punishment that may be applied, the distinction between victim and
victimizer must be kept in mind, and we must recognize that, for most
victims—those who are not masochists or sadists—punishing the wrongdoer
does not genuinely make the victim whole and does not directly benefit
the victim very much, if at all. A victim who has been shot in the arm
by a robber and who consequently loses his arm is clearly entitled, if
he wishes, to amputate the robber’s own arm. But this, of course, does
not restore the victim’s arm; it does not make him whole. Perfect
restitution is always an unreachable goal, for crimes cannot be
undone.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the right to punish is therefore useless, but
we must recognize that the victim remains a victim even after
retaliating against the wrongdoer. No punishment can undo the harm done.
For this reason, the victim’s range of punishment options should not be
artificially or easily restricted. This would further victimize him. The
victim did not choose to be made a victim and did not choose to be
placed in a situation where he has only one narrow punishment
option—namely, eye-for-an-eye retaliation. On the contrary, the
responsibility for this situation is entirely that of the aggressor who
by his action has damaged the victim. Because the aggressor has placed
the victim in a no-win situation where being restricted to one narrow
type of remedy may recompense the victim even less than other remedies,
the aggressor is estopped from complaining if the victim chooses among
varying types of punishment, subject to the proportionality
requirement.</p>
<p>In practice this means that, for example, the victim of assault and
battery need not be restricted to only having the aggressor beaten—or
even killed. The victim may abhor violence, and might choose to forego
any punishment at all if his only option was to either beat or punish
the aggressor. The victim may prefer, instead, to simply be compensated
monetarily out of any—current or future—property of the wrongdoer. Or,
if the victim believes he will gain more satisfaction from using force
against the aggressor in a way different than the manner in which the
aggressor violated the victim’s rights—for example, taking property of
an aggressor who has beaten the victim—the aggressor is estopped from
complaining about this as long as proportionality is satisfied.</p>
<p>The nonequivalence of most violent crimes makes this conclusion
clearer. Suppose that <em>A</em>, a man, rapes <em>B</em>, a woman.
<em>B</em> would be entitled to rape <em>A</em> in retaliation or to
have <em>A</em> raped by a professional, private punishing company. But
the last thing in the world that a rape victim might want is to be
involved in further sexual violence, and this alone would give her a
right to insist on other forms of punishment. To limit her remedy to
having <em>A</em> raped would be to inflict further damage on her.
<em>B</em> can never be made whole, but at least her best remedy—in her
opinion—of a variety of imperfect remedies need not be denied her. She
has done nothing to justify denying her such options.</p>
<p>And in this case there simply is no equivalent. The only remotely
similar equivalent is the forcible anal rape of <em>A</em>, but even
this is vastly different from the rape of a woman. If nothing else, a
woman might reasonably consider rape much more of a violation than would
a man “similarly” treated, for these acts give rise to different
consequences for the victim, a point that we need not belabor. Thus, if
there is no possibility of exact “eye-for-an-eye” style retaliation for
a given act of aggression, such as is the case with rape, then our
conclusion must be either that (1) <em>B</em> may not punish <em>A</em>,
or (2) <em>B</em> may punish <em>A</em> in another manner. Clearly, the
latter alternative is the correct one, for a rapist is estopped from
denying the right of his victim to punish him and is also estopped from
claiming a benefit because there is no equivalent punishment.
Furthermore, the absence of an equivalent punishment is a direct result
of <em>A</em>’s aggression. If <em>B</em> acts to mitigate the damage
done to her by <em>A</em>—which includes not only the rape, but placing
<em>B</em> in a situation where her remedies will all be inadequate and
where there is not even an equivalent punishment possible—<em>A</em> is
estopped from objecting. Thus, for example, <em>B</em> may choose,
instead, to have <em>A</em>’s penis amputated or even his arm or leg. Or
<em>B</em> may choose instead to have <em>A</em> publicly flogged,
displayed, and imprisoned for some length of time or even enslaved for a
time and put to work earning money for <em>B</em>. Alternatively,
<em>B</em> may threaten <em>A</em> with the most severe punishment she
has the right to inflict and allow <em>A</em> to buy his way out of the
punishment—or reduce its severity—with as much money as he is able or
willing to offer.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>Further, even if such rape of a man is somewhat equivalent to the
rape of a woman, the rape of an <em>innocent</em> person, <em>B</em>, is
typically much more of an offense than is a similar violation of a
criminal, <em>A</em>, who evidently does not abhor aggression as much.
<em>A</em>, the rapist, may even be a masochist and enjoy being beaten
or sodomized, so a more or less equal amount of physical punishment of
<em>A</em> would not really damage or truly punish <em>A</em> as badly
as <em>A</em> has damaged <em>B</em>. Because <em>A</em> is a criminal,
he is also likely accustomed to a lifestyle where force is used more
routinely so that “equal” punishment of <em>A</em> would not damage
<em>A</em> to the extent it would damage <em>B</em>, who is unused to
such violence. For these reasons, <em>B</em> is entitled to inflict a
greater amount of punishment on <em>A</em> than <em>A</em> inflicted on
<em>B</em>, if only to more or less equalize the actual level of damage
inflicted.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a> Thus, if <em>A</em> permanently
damages <em>B</em>’s arm, <em>B</em> may be entitled to damage both of
<em>A</em>’s arms or even all of <em>A</em>’s limbs.<a href="#fn198"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<p>Alternatively, a victim is entitled to take by force a certain amount
or portion of the aggressor’s property if this type of response to
aggression would better satisfy the victim or if the victim prefers this
remedy for any reason at all, including greed, malice, or sadism—the
victim’s motivation is not the aggressor’s rightful concern. Of course,
a mixture would be permissible as well. A woman might, in response to
being raped by a man, seize all of the ravisher’s $10,000 estate and
have him publicly beaten and enslaved for some number of years until his
forced labor earns her $100,000 more—assuming that this overall level of
punishment is roughly equivalent to the rape.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, a property aggressor, such as a thief, may be
dealt with any number of ways. The victim may satisfy himself solely out
of the aggressor’s property, if this is possible, or through corporal
punishment of the aggressor, if this better satisfies the victim—as
discussed in further detail below. In short, any rights or combinations
of rights of an aggressor may be ignored by a victim in punishing the
aggressor—implying that the aggressor actually does not have these
purported “rights”—as long as general bounds of proportionality are
considered.</p>
<h5 id="c.-enhancing-punishment-due-to-other-factors">C. Enhancing
Punishment Due to Other Factors</h5>
<p>Other factors may be considered that increase the amount of
punishment that may be inflicted on the aggressor over and above the
type of damage initially inflicted by the aggressor. As explained above
with regard to rape, aggression against an innocent, peaceful person may
cause more psychic damage to the victim than would an equivalent action
against the aggressor. Also, as Rothbard explains, a criminal, such as
thief <em>A</em>, has not only stolen something from victim <em>B</em>,
but he has “also put <em>B</em> into a state of fear and uncertainty, of
uncertainty as to the extent that <em>B</em>’s deprivation would go. But
the penalty levied on <em>A</em> is fixed and certain in advance, thus
putting <em>A</em> in far better shape than was his original victim.”<a
href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a> The criminal has also imposed
other damages, such as interest, and even general costs of crime
prevention—for who can such costs be blamed on and recouped from if not
criminals when they are caught? As Kant observed, “whoever steals
anything makes the property of all insecure.”<a href="#fn200"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>General bounds of proportionality are also satisfied when the
consequences and potential consequences to the victim that are caused by
the aggression are taken into account. Thus, some crimes may be punished
capitally if their consequences are serious enough—for example, stealing
a man’s horse when his survival depends on it, which was capitally
punished in the frontier West for the same reason.<a href="#fn201"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a>
(This is one point on which I disagree with Rothbard, however, who
argues that “it should be quite clear that, under libertarian law,
capital punishment would have to be confined strictly to the crime of
murder. For a criminal would only lose his right to life if he had first
deprived some victim of that same right. It would not be permissible,
then, for a merchant whose bubble-gum had been stolen, to execute the
convicted bubble-gum thief.”<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a> For one could
imagine rare situations where theft of bubble-gum could legitimately be
punished by execution, if the theft somehow endangered the life of its
owner.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a>)</p>
<h5 id="d.-graduated-scale-of-punishment">D. Graduated Scale of
Punishment</h5>
<p>Some would object to the use of the severe penalty of capital
punishment for crimes other than the most serious or heinous, such as
murder, mass-murder, or genocide. Many thus favor a scale of punishment
having more severe punishments for the most serious crimes with capital
punishment reserved for murderers or serial-killers and the like.<a
href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a> Perhaps some feel that a mass
murderer, serial killer, child killer, or cop killer should be punished
more harshly than a more typical murderer of one adult and that if
capital punishment is “wasted” on more mundane murderers or criminals,
there will be nothing more severe left to impose on the really bad guys;
there will be no deterrent effect left to deter extra acts of aggression
committed by those who have already placed themselves in the category of
deserving the death penalty. Of course, even if such a scale with
gradations of punishment would provide a “better” deterrent effect, this
does not mean that one does not have the right to punish a given
criminal in a certain way. Such utilitarian reasoning is beside the
point. If we had to save the more severe punishments for, say, mass
murderers, this in effect incorrectly attributes a right to life to
other murderers who simply do not have such a right.</p>
<p>Also, it should be realized that punishment of murderers is always an
imperfect remedy since the victim remains murdered, so that whether the
murderer remains underpunished even after being executed—like a regular
murderer—or <em>very</em> underpunished—like a mass murderer—this is an
unfortunate but simply irrelevant and inescapable fact. Furthermore,
punishment actually <em>can</em> be made more and more severe,
practically without limit, for greater and greater crimes. Death after
torture is worse punishment than mere death, and a longer period or
greater amount of physical pain being inflicted is more severe
punishment than a shorter period or lesser amount. The severity of
punishment can be varied, then, by varying the length of imprisonment,
by inflicting more or less physical pain, and by many other methods. For
example, for prison inmates, the severity of punishment can be adjusted
by varying the size of the prison cell, temperature, and quality of
food.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="e.-property-crimes">E. Property Crimes</h5>
<p>Aggression can also take the form of a property crime. For example,
where <em>A</em> has stolen $10,000 from <em>B</em>, <em>B</em> is
entitled to recoup $10,000 of <em>A</em>’s property. However, the
recapture of $10,000 is not punishment of <em>A</em> but merely the
recapture by <em>B</em> of his own property. <em>B</em> then has the
right to take another $10,000 of <em>A</em>’s property, or even a higher
amount if the $10,000 stolen from <em>B</em> was worth much more to
<em>B</em> than to <em>A</em>—for example, if <em>A</em> has a higher
time preference or less significant plans to use the money than
<em>B</em>, which is likely, or if <em>A</em> has more money than
<em>B</em>, which is unlikely.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a> This amount may also
be enhanced to take into account other damages, such as interest,
general costs of crime prevention, and compensation for putting the
victim into a state of fear and uncertainty.<a href="#fn207"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207" role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a>
It may also be enhanced to account for the uncertainty as to what the
exact amount of retaliation or restitution ought to be, as this
uncertainty is <em>A</em>’s fault, not <em>B</em>’s. Alternatively, at
the victim’s option, corporal punishment may be administered by
<em>B</em> <em>instead</em> of taking back his own $10,000—indeed, this
may be the only option where the thief is penniless or the stolen
property is spent or destroyed.</p>
<h5 id="f.-why-assault-threats-and-attempts-are-aggression">F. Why
Assault, Threats, and Attempts Are Aggression</h5>
<p>This method of analyzing whether a proposed punishment is proper also
makes it clear just why the threat of violence or assault is properly
treated as an aggressive crime. Assault is defined (in some legal
systems) as putting someone in fear of receiving a battery—a physical
beating—or an attempted battery.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref208" role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a> Suppose <em>A</em>
assaults <em>B</em>, such as by pointing a gun at him or threatening to
beat him. Clearly <em>B</em> is entitled to do to <em>A</em> what
<em>A</em> has done to <em>B</em>—<em>A</em> is estopped from objecting
to the propriety of being threatened or assaulted. But what does this
mean? To assault is to manifest an intent to cause harm and to apprise
<em>B</em> of this so that he <em>believes</em> <em>A</em> will inflict
this harm—otherwise it is something like a joke or acting, and
<em>B</em> is not actually in apprehension of being coerced. Now
<em>A</em> was able to actually put <em>B</em> in a state of fear—of
receiving a battery—by threatening <em>B</em>. But because of the nature
of assault, the only way <em>B</em> can really make <em>A</em> fear a
retaliatory act by <em>B</em> is if <em>B</em> <em>really means it</em>
and is able to convince <em>A</em> of this fact. Thus, <em>B</em> must
actually be—or be capable of being—willing to carry out the threatened
coercion of <em>A</em>, not just mouth the words, otherwise <em>A</em>
will know <em>B</em> is merely engaged in idle threats, merely bluffing.
Indeed, <em>B</em> can legitimately go forward with the threatened
action if only to make <em>A</em> believe it. Although <em>A</em> need
not actually use force to assault <em>B</em>, because of the nature of
retaliation, there is simply no way for <em>B</em> to assault <em>A</em>
in return without actually having the right to use force against
<em>A</em>. Because the very situation is caused by <em>A</em>’s action,
he is estopped from objecting to the necessity of <em>B</em> using force
against him.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>209</sup></a> Likewise, if <em>A</em> attempts
to harm <em>B</em> but fails, then <em>B</em> is entitled to “attempt”
to harm <em>A</em>; for the attempt to be a real attempt, it must be
possible for <em>B</em> to succeed. And so on.</p>
<h5 id="g.-the-burden-of-proof">G. The Burden of Proof</h5>
<p>As seen in the preceding discussion, the victim of a violent crime
has the right to select different mixtures and types of punishments. The
actual extent or severity of punishment that may be permissibly
inflicted, consistent with principles of proportionality and the burden
of proof in this regard, is discussed in this section.</p>
<p>Theories of punishment are concerned with justifying punishment, with
offering decent people who are reluctant to act immorally a reason why
they may punish others. This is useful, of course, for offering moral
people guidance and assurance that they may properly deal with those who
seek to harm them. We have established so far a prima facie case for the
right to proportionately punish an aggressor in response to acts of
violence, actions which invade the borders of others’ bodies or
legitimately acquired property. Once this burden is carried, however, it
is just to place the burden of proof on the aggressor to show why a
proposed punishment of him is disproportionate or otherwise unjustified.
The justice of this point is again implied by the logic of estoppel. The
aggressor was not put in the position of justifying how much force he
could use against the victim before he used such force; similarly, the
victim should not be put in the position of justifying how much force is
the appropriate level of retaliatory force to use against the aggressor
before retaliating.</p>
<p>As pointed out above, because it is the aggressor who has put the
victim into a situation where the victim has a limited variety and range
of remedies, the aggressor is estopped from complaining if the victim
uses a type of force against the aggressor that is different from the
aggressor’s use of force. The burden of proof and argument is therefore
on the aggressor to show why any proposed, creative punishment is
<em>not</em> justified by the aggressor’s aggression. Otherwise, an
additional burden is being placed on the victim in addition to the harm
already done him. If the victim wants to avoid shouldering this
additional burden, the aggressor is estopped from objecting because it
was the aggressor who placed the victim in the position of having the
burden in the first place. If there is a gray area, the aggressor ought
not be allowed to throw his hands up in mock perplexity and escape
liability; rather, the line ought to come down on the side of the gray
that most favors the victim unless the aggressor can further narrow the
gray area with convincing theories and arguments, for the aggressor is
the one who brings the gray into existence.</p>
<p>This is similar to the issue of proportionality itself. Although
proportionality or reciprocity is a requirement in general, if a prima
facie case for punishment can be established—as it can be whenever force
is initiated—the burden of proof lies with the aggressor to demonstrate
that <em>any</em> proposed use of force, even including execution,
mutilation, or enslavement, exceeds bounds of proportionality. As
mentioned above, in practice there are several clear areas: murder
justifies execution; minor, nonarmed, nonviolent theft does not.<a
href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a> Exceeding known appropriate levels
of retaliation makes the retaliator an aggressor to the extent of the
excess amount of force used. But there are indeed gray areas in which it
is difficult, if not impossible, to precisely delimit the exact amount
of maximum permissible punishment. However, this uncertain situation,
this grayness, is caused by the aggressor. The victim is placed in a
quandary and might underpunish, or underutilize his right to punish, if
he has to justify how much force he can use. Or he might have to expend
extra resources in terms of time or money—for example, to hire a
philosopher or lawyer to figure out exactly how much punishment is
warranted—which would impermissibly increase the total harm done to the
victim.</p>
<p>It is indeed difficult to determine the bounds of proportionality in
many cases. But we do know one thing: force has been initiated against
the victim, and thus force, in general, may be used against the
victimizer. Other than for easy or established cases, any ambiguity or
doubt must be resolved in favor of the victim unless the aggressor bears
his burden of argument to explain why the proposed punishment exceeds
his own initial aggression.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a> Unless the maximum
permissible level of retaliation is clearly established or persuasively
argued by the aggressor, there should be no limitations on the victim’s
right to retaliate. Further, suppose the aggressor is not able to show
why the victim may not execute him, even for a nonkilling act of
aggression, and thus the aggressor is executed. If the aggressor’s heirs
should later successfully show that the type of aggression perpetrated
by the aggressor did not, in fact, warrant capital punishment, still the
victim has committed no aggression. To so hold would be to require
victims to err on the side of underpunishing in cases of doubt in order
to avoid potential liability in the future if it turns out that the
aggressor could have made a better defensive argument. For the fact that
there is a doubtful question is the aggressor’s fault, and if he does
not resolve it—either because of laziness, incompetence, bad luck, or
tactics designed to make the victim unsure of how much he may punish—the
victim should not be further harmed by this fact, which he would be if
he were forced to take the risk that he might underpunish when punishing
in the gray area.</p>
<p>Thus, several factors may be taken into account in coming up with an
appropriate punishment. Suppose that an aggressor kidnaps and cuts off
the hand of the victim. The victim is clearly entitled to do the same to
the aggressor. But if the victim wishes to cut off the aggressor’s foot
instead—for some reason—he is, prima facie, entitled to do this. The
victim would also be entitled to cut off both of the aggressor’s hands
unless the aggressor could explain why this is a higher amount of
coercion than his own.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a> Merely cutting off
one of the aggressor’s hands might actually not be as extreme as was the
aggressor’s own action. For example, the victim may have been a painter.
Thus, the consequence of the aggressive violence might be that, in
addition to endangering the victim’s very life and causing pain, the
victim suffers a huge amount of mental and financial damage. It might
take cutting off all four of the aggressor’s limbs or even decapitating
him to inflict that much damage on him. We know that it is permissible
to employ violence against an aggressor. How much? Let the aggressor
bear the burden of figuring this out.</p>
<p>As mentioned above with respect to rape, the victim may be squeamish
about violence itself and thus recoil at the idea of eye-for-an-eye. If
that is the victim’s nature, the victim should not be penalized further
by being forced to administer <em>lex talionis</em>. The aggressor must
take his victim as he finds him<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref213" role="doc-noteref"><sup>213</sup></a> and is estopped from
complaining because he placed the victim in the situation where the
victim’s special preferences can only be satisfied by a nonreciprocal
punishment. Thus, the victim may instead choose to seize a certain
portion of the aggressor’s property. The amount of the award that is
“equal” to the damage done is of course difficult to determine, but, if
nothing else, similar principles could be used as are used in today’s
tort and criminal justice system. If the amount of damages is uncertain
or seems “too high,” it must be recalled that the aggressor himself
originated this state of uncertainty, and thus he cannot now be heard to
complain about it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a more objective damage award could be determined by
the victim bargaining away his right to inflict corporal punishment
against the aggressor in return for some or all of the aggressor’s
property.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>214</sup></a> This might be an especially
attractive—or the least unattractive—alternative for a person victimized
by a very rich aggressor. The established award for chopping someone’s
hand off might normally be, say, $1 million. However, this would mean
that a billionaire could commit such crimes with impunity. Under the
estoppel view of punishment, the victim, instead of taking $1 million of
the aggressor’s money, could kidnap the aggressor and threaten to
exercise his right to, say, chop off both of the aggressor’s arms,
slowly, and with pain. A billionaire may be willing to trade half, or
even all, his wealth to escape this punishment.</p>
<p>For poor aggressors, there is no property to take as restitution, and
the mere infliction of pain on the aggressor may not satisfy some
victims. They would be entitled to enslave the aggressor or sell him
into slavery or for medical testing to yield the best profit possible.<a

<h4 id="v.-conclusion">V. CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>The ways in which punishment can be administered are rich and
various, but all the typically-cited goals of punishment could be
accommodated under the view of punishment set forth above. Criminals
could be incapacitated and deterred, even rehabilitated, perhaps,
according to the victim’s choice. Restitution could be obtained in a
variety of ways, or, if the victim so chooses, retribution or revenge.
Though it is difficult to precisely determine the boundaries of
proportionality, justice requires that the aggressor be held responsible
for the dilemma he has created as well as for the aggression he has
committed.</p>

id="appendix-the-justice-of-responsive-force"><strong>APPENDIX</strong>
THE JUSTICE OF RESPONSIVE FORCE</h4>
<p>In Part III.C above, I discussed the legitimacy of punishing
aggressors, that is, the justice of <em>responsive</em> force—force that
is <em>in response to</em> aggression, or initiated force. As noted
above, the material here was originally intended to appear in footnote
44, above. Due to its length, I include this material in this
appendix.</p>
<p>As noted in “Dialogical Arguments for Libertarian Rights” (ch. 6),
“Defending Argumentation Ethics” (ch. 7), and “The Undeniable Morality
of Capitalism” (ch. 22), Hans-Hermann Hoppe has defended the right to
self-defense and retaliatory force in his argumentation ethics. For a
recent book-length treatment of ideas related to Hoppe’s argumentation
ethics and my estoppel approach advanced in this chapter, see Pavel
Slutskiy, <em>Communication and Libertarianism</em> (Springer, 2021),
and further references in these chapters.</p>
<p>Others have previously recognized the justice of using force against
one who has used force. Law professor Lawrence Crocker writes:</p>
<p>Suppose … that A and B are shipwrecked on a deserted island. A makes
use of the only firearm salvaged from the wreck to force B to build him
a shelter. If B gains control of the gun, it will not be unfair for B to
use it to force A to return the favor.<a href="#fn216"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>Libertarian philosopher John Hospers opined that when an aggressor
initiates force, “the victim is entitled to respond according to the
rule (‘<em>The use of force is permissible</em>’) that the <em>aggressor
himself</em> has implicitly laid down.”<a href="#fn217"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>217</sup></a>
According to Herbert Morris:</p>
<p>If I say the magic words “take the watch for a couple of days” or “go
ahead and slap me,” have I waived my right not to have my property taken
or a right not to be struck or have I, rather, in saying what I have,
simply stepped into a relation in which the rights no longer apply with
respect to a specified other person? These observations find support in
the following considerations. The right is that which gives rise, when
infringed, to a legitimate claim against another person. What this
suggests is that the right is that sphere interference with which
<em>entitles us to complain</em> or gives us a right to complain. From
this it seems to follow that a right to bodily security should be more
precisely described as “a right that others not interfere <em>without
permission</em>.” And there is the corresponding duty not to interfere
unless provided permission. Thus when we talk of waiving our rights or
“giving up our rights” in such cases we are not waiving or giving up our
right to property nor our right to bodily security, for we still, of
course, possess the right not to have our watch taken without
permission. <em>We have rather placed ourselves in a position where we
do not possess the capacity</em>, sometimes called a right, <em>to
complain</em> if the person takes the watch or slaps us.<a href="#fn218"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
<p>Or as Hegel wrote:</p>
<p>The injury [the penalty] which falls on the criminal is not merely
<em>implicitly</em> just—as just, it is <em>eo ipso</em> his implicit
will, an embodiment of his freedom, his right; on the contrary, it is
also a right <em>established</em> within the criminal himself, i.e., in
his objectively embodied will, in his action. The reason for this is
that <em>his action</em> is the action of a rational being and this
implies that <em>it is something universal</em> and that <em>by doing it
the criminal has laid down a law which he has explicitly recognized in
his action</em> and under which in consequence he should be brought as
under his right.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>219</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, under Hegel’s philosophy, “when a criminal steals another
person’s property, he is not only denying that person’s right to own
that piece of property, he is denying the right to property in
<em>itself</em>.”<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
<p>Charles King, discussing the moral acceptability of using force
against force, states that when another initiates force,</p>
<p>[w]ith him we are returned to the first-stage state of nature and may
use force against him. In so doing we do not violate his rights or in
any other way violate the principle of right, because he has broken the
<em>reciprocity</em> required for us to view such a principle [of
rights] as binding. In this we find the philosophic grounding for the
moral legitimacy of the practice of punishment. Punishment is just that
practice which raises the price of violation of the principle of right
so as to give us all good reason to accept that principle.<a
href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<p>Or as Locke writes:</p>
<p>In transgressing the law of nature, the offender declares himself to
live by another rule than that of reason and common equity ... and so he
becomes dangerous to mankind, ... every man ... by the right he hath to
preserve mankind in general, may restrain, or where it is necessary,
destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one,
who hath transgressed that law, as may make him repent the doing of it.
... [A] criminal, who having renounced reason, the common rule and
measure God hath given to mankind, hath, by the unjust violence and
slaughter he hath committed upon one, declared war against all mankind,
and therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tiger, one of those wild
savage beasts, with whom men can have no society nor security.<a

<p><sup>**</sup> The term “dialogical” in my title refers to discourse,
or dialogue, which features in many of the theories discussed here,
including Hoppe’s discourse or argumentation ethics and many others
mentioned in this chapter. As noted in “Defending Argumentation Ethics”
(ch. 7) and “The Undeniable Morality of Capitalism” (ch. 22), Hoppe’s
discourse ethics was influenced by the discourse ethics of Jürgen
Habermas, Hoppe’s PhD advisor, and Karl-Otto Apel. Interestingly,
although Rawls says, of his own “original position,” “[l]ike Habermas’s
ideal discourse situation, it is a dialogue; indeed, an omnilogue, …
Habermas sometimes says that the original position is monological and
not dialogical; that is because all the parties have, in effect, the
same reasons and so they elect the same principles.” John Rawls,
<em>Political Liberalism</em>, expanded ed. (New York: Columbia
University Press, 2005), p. 383. For our purposes, I think the term
dialogue or dialogical suffices.</p>
<p>Classical liberals and libertarians believe that individuals have
rights, even if there is debate about just why we have them or how this
can be proved. Robert Nozick opened his book <em>Anarchy, State, and
Utopia</em> with the assertion: “Individuals have rights, and there are
things no person or group may do to them (without violating their
rights).”<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>227</sup></a> Yet, he did not offer a proof of
this assertion, for which he has drawn criticism. It is commonly assumed
that Nozick’s argument is not <em>complete</em> until a proof of rights
is offered.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>228</sup></a> Other theorists have offered, over
the years, various reasons—utilitarian, natural law, pragmatic, and the
like—why we should respect others’ rights, why we should recognize that
individuals have certain rights.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<p>For instance, an economic case can be made for respecting the liberty
of others. Given that you are a decent person and generally value your
fellow man and wish everyone to live a satisfying life, you will tend to
be in favor of the free market and liberty, at least if you understand
basic economic principles.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>230</sup></a> But the success of
arguments such as these depends on other people accepting particular
premises, such as valuing the general well-being of others, without
which the argument is incomplete. Skeptics can always deny the validity
of the premises even if they cannot refute free-market economics.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that a rigorous argument for individual rights
would be useful. In recent years, interest has been increasing in
rationalist, dialectical, or dialogical rights theories or related
theories, some of which promise to provide fruitful and unassailable
defenses of individual rights. These arguments typically examine the
implicit claims that are necessarily presupposed by action or discourse.
They then proceed deductively or conventionally from these core
premises, or axioms, to establish certain apodictically true
conclusions. Several such arguments are surveyed below.</p>
<h4 id="argumentation-ethics">ARGUMENTATION ETHICS</h4>
<p>Let us first discuss Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s pathbreaking “argumentation
ethics” defense of libertarian rights.<a href="#fn231"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231" role="doc-noteref"><sup>231</sup></a>
Hoppe shows that basic rights are implied in the activity of
argumentation itself, so that anyone asserting any claim about anything
necessarily presupposes the validity of rights. Hoppe first notes that
any truth at all (including norms such as individual rights to life,
liberty, and property) that one would wish to discuss, deny, or affirm
will be brought up in the course of an argumentation, that is to say,
will be brought up in dialogue. If participants in argumentation
necessarily accept particular truths, including norms, in order to
engage in argumentation, they could never challenge these norms in an
argument without thereby engaging in a performative contradiction. This
would establish these norms as literally incontestable truths.</p>
<p>Hoppe establishes self-ownership by pointing out that argumentation,
as a form of action, implies the use of the scarce resources of one’s
body. One must have control over, or own, this scarce resource in order
to engage in meaningful discourse. This is because argumentation is, by
its very nature, a <em>conflict-free</em> way of interacting, since it
is an attempt to find what the truth <em>is</em>, to establish truth, to
persuade or be persuaded by the force of words alone. If one is
threatened into accepting the statements or truth-claims of another,
this does not tend to get at the truth, which is undeniably a goal of
argumentation or discourse. Thus, anyone engaging in argumentation
implicitly presupposes the right of self-ownership of other participants
in the argument, for otherwise the other would not be able to consider
freely and accept or reject the proposed argument. Only as long as there
is at least an implicit recognition of each individual’s property right
in his or her own body can true argumentation take place. When this
right is not recognized, the activity is no longer argumentation, but
threat, mere naked aggression, or plain physical fighting. Thus, anyone
who denies that rights exist contradicts himself since, by his very
engaging in the cooperative and conflict-free activity of argumentation,
he necessarily recognizes the right of his listener to be free to
listen, think, and decide. That is, any participant in discourse
presupposes the non-aggression principle, the libertarian view that one
may not initiate force against others. Thus, according to Hoppe, anyone
who would ever deny the ethics underlying the free market is already, by
his very engaging in the civilized activity of discourse, presupposing
the very ethic that he is challenging. This is a powerful argument
because, instead of seeking to persuade someone to accept a new
position, it points out to him a position that he already maintains, a
position that he <em>necessarily</em> maintains. Opponents of liberty
undercut their own position as soon as they begin to state it.</p>
<p>Hoppe then extends his case for self-ownership to external resources,
to show that property rights in external scarce resources, in addition
to self-ownership rights, are also presupposed by discourse. As he
argues, “one’s body is indeed the <em>prototype</em> of a scarce good
for the use of which property rights, that is, rights of exclusive
ownership, somehow have to be established, in order to avoid clashes.”<a
href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>232</sup></a> As Hoppe explains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The compatibility of this principle with that of nonaggression can be
demonstrated by means of an argumentum a contrario. First, it should be
noted that if no one had the right to acquire and control anything
except his own body … then we would all cease to exist and the problem
of the justification of normative statements … simply would not exist.
The existence of this problem is only possible because we are alive, and
our existence is due to the fact that we do not, indeed cannot,
accept<br />
a norm outlawing property in other scarce goods next and in addition to
that of one’s physical body. Hence, the right to acquire such goods must
be assumed to exist.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, Hoppe argues that the only ownership rule that is compatible
with self-ownership and the presuppositions of discourse is the Lockean
original-appropriation rule.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref234" role="doc-noteref"><sup>234</sup></a> Hoppe’s basic point
here is that self-ownership rights are established just because one’s
body is itself a scarce (conflictable) resource, so other scarce
resources must be similarly ownable.<a href="#fn235"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>235</sup></a></p>
<p>Looked at from another angle, participants in argumentation
indisputably need to use and control the scarce resources in the world
to survive; otherwise, they would perish. But because their scarcity
makes conflict over the uses of resources possible, only norms that
determine the proper ownership can avoid conflict over these scarce
goods. That such norms are valuable cannot be denied, because anyone who
is alive in the world and participating in the practical activity of
argumentation cannot deny the value of being able to control scarce
resources and the value of avoiding conflicts over such scarce (i.e.,
conflictable) resources.</p>
<p>So no one could ever deny that norms for determining the ownership of
scarce goods are useful for allowing conflict-free exploitation of such
resources. But, as Hoppe points out, there are only two fundamental
alternatives for acquiring rights in unowned property: (1) by doing
something with things with which no one else had ever done anything
before, that is, the Lockean concept of mixing of labor, or
homesteading; or (2) simply by verbal declaration or decree. However, a
rule that allows property to be owned by mere verbal declaration cannot
serve to avoid conflicts, since any number of people could at any time
assert conflicting claims of ownership over any particular scarce
resource. Only the first alternative, that of Lockean homesteading,
establishes an objective (or, as Hoppe sometimes calls it,
intersubjectively ascertainable) link between a particular person and a
particular scarce resource, and thus no one can deny the Lockean right
to homestead unowned resources.</p>
<h4 id="argumentation-ethics-and-natural-rights"><em>Argumentation
Ethics and Natural Rights</em></h4>
<p>Before closing this section let me emphasize that Hoppe offered his
theory as an improvement on traditional natural rights arguments. For
one, by focusing on argumentation instead of action,<a href="#fn236"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236" role="doc-noteref"><sup>236</sup></a>
he seeks to avoid one weakness of previous arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been a common quarrel with the natural rights position, even
on the part of sympathetic readers, that the concept of human nature is
far “too diffuse and varied to provide a determinate set of contents of
natural law.”<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe is also critical of classical natural rights reasoning insofar
as it violates the is-ought gap. As he writes: “[O]ne can readily
subscribe to the almost generally accepted view that the gulf between
‘ought’ and ‘is’ is logically unbridgeable.”<a href="#fn238"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238" role="doc-noteref"><sup>238</sup></a>
Argumentation ethics attempts to sidestep this issue by remaining in the
realm of is-statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here the praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of
offering a completely value-free justification of private property. It
remains entirely in the realm of is-statements, and nowhere tries to
derive an ought from an is. The structure of the argument is this: (a)
justification is propositional justification—a priori true is-statement;
(b) argumentation presupposes property in one’s body and the
homesteading principle—a priori true is-statement; and (c) then, no
deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified—a priori true
is-statement.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, as Hoppe writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relationship between our approach and a “natural rights” approach
can now be described in some detail, too. The natural law or natural
rights tradition of philosophic thought holds that universally valid
norms can be discerned by means of reason as grounded in the very nature
of man. It has been a common quarrel with this position, even on the
part of sympathetic readers, that the concept of human nature is far
“too diffuse and varied to provide a determinate set of contents of
natural law.” … Furthermore, its description of rationality is equally
ambiguous in that it does not seem to distinguish between the role of
reason in establishing empirical laws of nature on the one hand, and
normative laws of human conduct on the other….</p>
<p>In recognizing the narrower concept of argumentation (instead of the
wider one of human nature) as the necessary starting point in deriving
an ethic, and in assigning to moral reasoning the status of a priori
reasoning, clearly to be distinguished from the role of reason performed
in empirical research, our approach not only claims to avoid these
difficulties from the outset, but claims thereby to be at once more
straightforward and rigorous. Still, to thus dissociate myself from the
natural rights tradition is not to say that I could not agree with its
critical assessment of most of contemporary ethical theory; indeed I do
agree with H. Veatch’s complementary refutation of all desire
(teleological, utilitarian) ethics as well as all duty (deontological)
ethics…. Nor do I claim that it is impossible to interpret my approach
as falling in a “rightly conceived” natural rights tradition after all.
What I claim, though, is that the following approach is clearly out of
line with what the natural rights approach has actually come to be, and
that it owes nothing to this tradition as it stands.<a href="#fn240"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>240</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this, perhaps, part of the reason why Rothbard gave a
wholehearted endorsement to Hoppe’s argumentation ethics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and
for libertarianism in particular, he [Hoppe] has managed to transcend
the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy
since the days of the scholastics, and that had brought modern
libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock. Not only that: Hans Hoppe has
managed to establish the case for anarcho-capitalist, Lockean rights in
an unprecedentedly hard-core manner, one that makes my own natural
law/natural rights position seem almost wimpy in comparison.<a
href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="estoppel">ESTOPPEL</h4>
<p>Another rationalist-oriented justification of rights is an argument I
developed based on the common-law concept of estoppel.<a href="#fn242"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242" role="doc-noteref"><sup>242</sup></a>
As one legal treatise explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word <em>estoppel</em> means “not permitted to deny.” If A makes
a statement of fact that B relies on in some substantial way, A will not
be permitted to deny it (that is, A will be estopped), if the effect of
A’s denial would be to injure the party who relies on it.<a
href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>243</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, under the traditional <em>legal</em> principle of estoppel, a
person may be prevented, or estopped, from maintaining something (for
example in court) inconsistent with his previous conduct or statements.
For instance, if a father promises his daughter that he will pay her
college tuition for her, and the daughter relies on this promise to her
detriment, for example by enrolling in college and becoming obligated to
the college for her tuition, then she may be able to recover some of her
expenses from her father, even if his original promise is not
enforceable as a normal contract (for example, because there was no
consideration).<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>244</sup></a> The father would be estopped from
denying that a contract was formed, even though, technically, one was
not.</p>
<p>Drawing on this legal terminology and concept, the approach I advance
may be termed “dialogical” estoppel, or simply estoppel. The estoppel
principle shows that an aggressor contradicts himself if he objects to
others’ enforcement of their rights. Thus, unlike Hoppe’s argumentation
ethics approach, which focuses on presuppositions of discourse in
general, and which shows that any participant in discourse contradicts
himself if he denies these presuppositions, the estoppel theory focuses
on the discourse between an aggressor and his victim about punishment of
the aggressor and seeks to show that the aggressor contradicts himself
if he objects to his punishment.</p>
<p>What would it mean to have a right? Whatever else rights might be,
certainly it is the case that rights are legitimately enforceable; that
is, one who is physically able to enforce his right <em>may</em>
<em>not</em> be prevented from doing so. In short, having a right allows
one to legitimately punish the violator of the right or to legitimately
use force to prevent another from violating the right. The only way one
could be said <em>not</em> to have a right would be if the attempt to
punish a violator of the right is for some reason unjustifiable. But
clearly this problem itself can arise only when the alleged criminal
<em>objects</em> to being punished, for if criminals consented to
punishment, we would not face the problem of justifying punishing
them.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>The estoppel argument contends that we have rights just because no
aggressor could ever meaningfully object to being punished. Thus, if the
only potential obstacle to having a legitimately enforceable right is
the unconsenting criminal, and if he is estopped from objecting to his
punishment, then the right may be said to exist, or be justified, since,
in effect, the criminal cannot deny this.</p>
<p>So why is this the case? Why is a criminal estopped in this manner?
Consider: if <em>B</em> is a violent aggressor, such as a murderer or
rapist, how could he <em>not</em> consent to any punishment that
<em>A</em>, the victim (or the victim’s agent), attempts to inflict? To
object to his punishment, <em>B</em> must engage in discourse with
<em>A</em>; he must at least temporarily adopt the stance of a peaceful,
civilized person trying to persuade <em>A</em>, through the use of
reason and consistent, universalizable principles, to provide reasons as
to why <em>A</em> should not punish him. But to do this, <em>B</em> must
in essence claim that <em>A</em> should not use force against him
(<em>B</em>), and to do this, <em>B</em> must claim that it is wrong, or
unjustifiable, to use force. But since he <em>has</em> initiated force,
he has admitted that (he believes that) it is proper to use force, and
<em>B</em> would contradict himself if he were to claim the opposite.
Since contradictions are always false<a href="#fn246"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246" role="doc-noteref"><sup>246</sup></a>
and since an undeniable goal of discourse is to establish truth, such
contradictions are ruled out of bounds in discourse, since they cannot
tend to establish truth. Thus, <em>B</em> is estopped from making this
contradictory assertion, and is therefore unable to object to his
punishment.</p>
<p>Under the estoppel theory, then, we may enforce our rights against
violent aggressors, since they cannot object to the enforcement of
rights without self-contradiction.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref247" role="doc-noteref"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="rights-skepticism">RIGHTS-SKEPTICISM</h4>
<p>A third type of rights argument concerns the very nature of rights
themselves and shows how any rights-skeptic contradicts himself whenever
he denies that rights exist. It is similar to the estoppel approach
outlined above, although the discourse under examination need not
involve an aggressor. Instead, this argument focuses on rights-skeptics
who deny the existence of rights, rather than on actual criminals who
object to being punished in particular instances for a given crime.</p>
<p>If any right at all exists, it is a right of <em>A</em> to have or do
<em>X</em> without <em>B</em>’s preventing it; and, therefore,
<em>A</em> can legitimately use force against <em>B</em> to
en<em>force</em> the right.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref248" role="doc-noteref"><sup>248</sup></a> <em>A</em> is
concerned with the enforceability of his right to <em>X</em>, and this
enforceability is all that <em>A</em> requires in order to be secure in
his right to <em>X</em>. For a rights-skeptic meaningfully to challenge
<em>A</em>’s asserted right, the skeptic must challenge the
<em>enforceability</em> of the right, instead of merely challenging the
existence of the right. Nothing less will do. If the skeptic does not
deny that <em>A</em>’s proposed enforcement of his purported right is
legitimate, then the skeptic has not denied <em>A</em>’s right to
<em>X</em>, because what it <em>means</em> to have a right is to be able
to legitimately enforce it. If the skeptic maintains, then, that
<em>A</em> has no right to <em>X</em>, indeed, no rights at all since
there are no rights, the skeptic must also maintain that <em>A</em>’s
enforcement of his purported right to <em>X</em> is not justified.</p>
<p>But the problem faced by the skeptic here is that he assumes that
enforcement—that is, the use of force—<em>requires</em> justification.
<em>A</em>, however, cares not that the rights-skeptic merely challenges
<em>A</em>’s use of force against <em>B</em>. The rights-skeptic must do
more than express his <em>preference</em> that <em>A</em> not enforce
his right against <em>B</em>, for such an expression does not attack the
legitimacy of <em>A</em>’s enforcing his right against <em>B</em>. The
only way for the skeptic meaningfully to challenge <em>A</em>’s
enforcement action is to acknowledge that <em>B</em> may use force to
prevent <em>A</em>’s (illegitimate) enforcement action. And here the
rights-skeptic (perversely) undercuts his own position, because by
recognizing the legitimacy of <em>B</em>’s use of force against
<em>A</em>, the rights-skeptic effectively attributes rights to
<em>B</em> himself, the right not to have unjustifiable force used
against him. In short, for anyone to meaningfully maintain that
<em>A</em> has no rights against <em>B</em> on the grounds that no
rights exist, he must effectively attribute rights to <em>B</em> so that
<em>B</em> may defend himself against <em>A</em>’s purportedly
unwarranted enforcement action.</p>
<p>More common-sensically, this demonstration points out the
inconsistency on the part of a rights-skeptic who engages in discourse
about the propriety of rights at all. If there are no rights, then there
is no such thing as the justifiable or legitimate use of force, but
neither is there such a thing as the unjust use of force. But if there
is no unjust use of force, what is it, exactly, that a rights-skeptic is
concerned about? If individuals delude themselves into thinking that
they have natural rights, and, acting on this assumption, go about
enforcing these rights as if they are true, the skeptic has no grounds
to complain. To the extent the skeptic complains about people enforcing
these illusory rights, he begins to attribute rights to those having
force used against them. Any rights-skeptic can only shut up, because he
contradicts himself the moment he objects to others’ acting as if they
have rights.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"

<h4 id="other-rationalist-related-theories">OTHER RATIONALIST-RELATED
THEORIES</h4>
<p>In addition to the three approaches discussed above, other arguments,
which also point out the inherent presuppositions of discourse or
action, are briefly discussed below.</p>
<h5
id="g.b.-madison-and-argumentation-ethics-related-theorists"><em>G.B.
Madison and Argumentation Ethics-Related Theorists</em></h5>
<p>One approach that is similar to Hoppe’s argumentation ethics is that
of philosopher G.B. Madison. Madison argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the various values defended by liberalism are not arbitrary, a matter
of mere personal preference, nor do they derive from some natural law. …
Rather, they are nothing less and nothing more than what could be called
the <em>operative presuppositions</em> or intrinsic features and demands
of communicative rationality itself. In other words, they are values
that are implicitly recognized and affirmed by everyone by the very fact
of their engaging in communicative reason. This amounts to saying that
no one can rationally deny them without at the same time denying reason,
without self-contradiction, without in fact abandoning all attempts to
persuade the other and to reach agreement.<a href="#fn250"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These implicitly recognized values include a renunciation of the
legitimacy of violence. Thus, “it is absolutely impossible for anyone
who claims to be rational, which is to say human, outrightly to defend
violence.” <a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<p>Madison continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Paul] Ricoeur writes: “… <em>violence is the opposite of
discourse</em>…. Violence is always the interruption of discourse:
discourse is always the interruption of violence.” That violence is the
opposite of discourse means that it can never justify itself—and is
therefore not justifiable—for only through discourse can anything be
justified. As the theory of rational argumentation and discussion,
liberalism amounts, therefore, to a rejection of power politics.<a
href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madison, like Hoppe, argues that the fact-value gap can be bridged by
an appeal to the nature of discourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the notion of <em>universal human rights and liberties</em> is not an
… arbitrary value, a matter of mere personal preference…. On the
contrary, it is nothing less and nothing more than the operative
presupposition or intrinsic feature and demand of communicative
rationality itself.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>253</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a sense, notes Madison, Thomas Jefferson was not so far off in
calling our rights “self-evident.”</p>
<p>The general thrust of Madison’s argument seems sound, although it is
not as consistent or fully developed as Hoppe’s argumentation ethics.
While Hoppe shows that the nonaggression principle (i.e., self-ownership
plus the right to homestead external resources) itself is directly
implied by any discourse or argumentation, Madison’s train of logic
seems more muddled. For instance, he argues that, because discourse has
“priority” over violence, this validates the Kantian claim that people
ought to be treated as ends rather than means, which is the principle of
human dignity. The principle of freedom from coercion then follows from
the principle of human dignity. Madison does not specify in any more
detail than this the libertarian principles that can be derived from
such an approach,<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>254</sup></a> although, to be fair, Madison
stresses that his remarks are intended only “to indicate the way in
which liberalism must seek to” defend the values it advocates.<a
href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
<p>Frank van Dun similarly suggests that part of “the ethics of
dialogue” is that we ought to respect the “dialogical rights of
others—their right to speak or not to speak, to listen or not to listen,
to use their own judgment.”<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref256" role="doc-noteref"><sup>256</sup></a> Van Dun argues that
“principles of private property and uncoerced exchange” are also
presupposed by participants in discourse and later defended Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>257</sup></a> Jeremy Shearmur also proposes<a
href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>258</sup></a> that a Habermasian argument may be
developed to justify individual property rights and other classical
liberal principles, although this argument is different in approach from
that of Hoppe, Madison, and Van Dun, and is, in my view, much weaker
than Hoppe’s approach.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref259" role="doc-noteref"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
<p>Other theories that are briefly worth mentioning here include Paul
Chevigny’s theory that the nature of discourse may be used to defend the
right to free speech<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a> and Tibor Machan’s view that
discourse in general and political dialogue in particular rest on
individualist prerequisites or presuppositions.<a href="#fn261"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a></p>
<p>Murray Rothbard, who was very enthusiastic about Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics, was also hopeful that Hoppe’s argumentation ethics
or axiomatic approach could be further extended. As Rothbard stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A future research program for Hoppe and other libertarian
philosophers would be (a) to see how far axiomatics can be extended into
other spheres of ethics, or (b) to see if and how this axiomatic could
be integrated into the standard natural law approach.<a href="#fn262"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The various perspectives of Hoppe, Madison, Van Dun, and others on a
similar theme indicate that Rothbard may indeed be correct that this
type of rationalist thinking can be further extended in libertarian or
ethical theory.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>263</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="crockers-moral-estoppel-theory"><em>Crocker’s Moral Estoppel
Theory</em></h5>
<p>In a theory bearing some resemblance to the estoppel theory discussed
above, law professor Lawrence Crocker proposes the use of “moral
estoppel” in preventing a criminal from asserting the unfairness of
being punished in certain situations. Crocker’s theory, while
interesting, is not rigorous, and Crocker does not seem to realize the
implications of estoppel for justifying only the <em>libertarian</em>
conception of rights. Rather than focusing on the reciprocity between
the force used in punishment and the force of an aggressive act by a
wrongdoer, Crocker claims that a person who has “treated another person
or the society at large in a fashion that the criminal law prohibits” is
“morally estopped” from asserting that his punishment would be unfair.<a
href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>264</sup></a> However, Crocker’s use of estoppel
is too vague and imprecise, and relies on a legal positivist conception
of law, for just because one has violated a criminal law does not mean
that one has committed the aggression that is necessary to estop him
from complaining about punishment. A breached law must first be
legitimate (just) for Crocker’s assumption to hold, but as the estoppel
theory indicates, a law is legitimate only if it prohibits aggression.
Crocker’s theory seems to assume that any law is valid, even those that
do not prohibit the initiation of force.</p>
<h5
id="pilon-and-gewirth-on-the-principle-of-generic-consistency"><em>Pilon
and Gewirth on the Principle of Generic Consistency</em></h5>
<p>Another rights theory that bears mention here is that of Roger Pilon.
Pilon has developed a libertarian version of the theory propounded by
his teacher Alan Gewirth.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref265" role="doc-noteref"><sup>265</sup></a> Although he
disagrees with the non-libertarian conclusions that Gewirth draws from
his own rights theory, Pilon builds “upon much of the justificatory
groundwork he [Gewirth] has established, for I believe he has located,
drawn together, and solved some of the most basic problems in the theory
of rights.”<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<p>To determine what rights we have, Pilon (following Gewirth) focuses
on “what it is we necessarily claim about ourselves, if only implicitly,
when we act.”<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a> Pilon argues that all action is
<em>conative</em>, that is, an agent acts voluntarily and for purposes
which seem good to him. Pilon argues that the prerequisites of
successful action are “voluntariness and purposiveness,” the so-called
generic features that characterize all action. Thus, an agent cannot
help valuing these generic features and even making a rights-claim to
them, according to Pilon/Gewirth. From this conclusion, it is argued
that all agents also necessarily claim rights against coercion and harm.
And since it would be inconsistent to maintain that one has rights for
these reasons without also admitting that others have these rights too
(since the reasoning concerning the nature of action applies equally to
all purposive actors), such rights-claims must be universalizable.<a
href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a> As Gewirth writes, the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>voluntariness and purposiveness which every agent necessarily has in
acting, and which he necessarily claims as rights for himself on the
ground that he is a prospective agent who wants to fulfill his purposes,
he must also, on pain of self-contradiction, admit to be rights of his
recipient.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, an agent in any action makes a rights-claim to be free from
coercion and harm, since such rights are necessary to provide for the
generic features of action, which an agent also necessarily values, and
the agent also necessarily grants these rights to others because of the
universalizability requirement.</p>
<p>From this point, Pilon/Gewirth develops a sort of modern categorical
imperative, which is called the “Principle of Generic Consistency”
(PGC). The PGC is: “Act in accord with the generic rights of your
recipients as well as of yourself,” and “Recipients are those who stand
opposite agents, who are ‘affected by’ or ‘recipients of’ their
actions.”<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>270</sup></a> Under Pilon’s libertarian working
of the PGC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he PGC does not require anyone to <em>do</em> anything. It is
addressed to agents, but it does not require anyone to be an agent who
has recipients. An individual can “do nothing” if he chooses, spending
his life in idle contemplation. Provided there are no recipients of this
behavior, he is at perfect liberty to perform it. And if there are
recipients, the PGC requires only that he act in accord with the generic
rights of those recipients, <em>i.e.</em>, that he not coerce or harm
them.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pilon extends his reasoning and works the PGC to flesh out more fully
just what (primarily libertarian) rights we do have.</p>
<p>All this is well done, except for one crucial error. As Hoppe points
out, it is <em>argumentation</em>, not action, that is the appropriate
starting point for such an analysis, because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[F]rom the correctly stated fact that in action an agent must, by
necessity, presuppose the existence of certain values or goods, it does
not follow that such goods then are universalizable and hence should be
respected by others as the agent’s goods by right…. Rather, the idea of
truth, or of universalizable rights or goods only emerges with
argumentation as a special subclass of actions, but not with action as
such, as is clearly revealed by the fact that Gewirth, too, is not
engaged simply in action, but more specifically in argumentation when he
wants to convince us of the necessary truth of his ethical system.<a
href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>272</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that, despite this error, much of Pilon’s work is
salvageable by, in effect, moving it to an argumentation context, such
as is done in the estoppel approach where an aggressor must engage in
argumentation to object to his punishment and is therefore subject to
the unique constraints of argumentation. In other words, the weak link
in Pilon’s PGC chain may be able to be repaired by considering claims
made <em>about</em> prior actions when the agent later objects to
punishment, for an objection to being punished requires the agent to
enter into the special subclass action of argumentation, to which
criteria such as universalizability do apply.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>Under the three theories outlined above—argumentation ethics,
estoppel theory, and the self-contradictions of rights-skeptics—we can
see that the relevant participant in discourse cannot deny the validity
of individual rights. These rationalist-oriented theories offer very
good defenses of individual rights, defenses that are more powerful than
many other approaches, because they show that the opponent of individual
rights, whether criminal, skeptic, or socialist, presupposes that they
are true. Critics must enter the cathedral of libertarianism even to
deny that it exists. This makes criticism of libertarian beliefs hollow:
for if someone asks why we believe in individual rights, we can tell
them to look in the mirror and find the answer there.</p>

<p>I intend here to provide a short guide to the relevant literature
followed by a limited response to MC’s critique of Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics.</p>
<h4 id="background">BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>Hoppe published several pieces expounding his “argumentation ethics”
defense of libertarian rights, including “The Ultimate Justification of
the Private Property Ethic” in <em>Liberty</em> magazine in 1988,<a
href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>273</sup></a> which resulted in a large number
of commentaries from several libertarian thinkers.<a href="#fn274"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274" role="doc-noteref"><sup>274</sup></a>
Over the next few years, Hoppe’s theory was intensely debated and
commented on by several libertarians. Several replies and reviews, for
example, were published in <em>Liberty</em> and elsewhere, by
libertarians such as Murray Rothbard, David Gordon, Tibor Machan, David
Friedman, Loren Lomasky, David Osterfeld, Sheldon Richman, Leland
Yeager, David Ramsay Steele, Douglas Rasmussen, David Conway, and
others. Hoppe responded to many of these pieces at length.<a
href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>275</sup></a></p>
<p>Several of the replies to Hoppe were unusually nasty and unfair. Some
were shocked anyone would argue for “untrammeled anarchism” and others
were turned off by the idea that libertarian rights could be rigorously
proved.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>276</sup></a> Others badly misconstrued Hoppe’s
argument. Still others, like Rothbard, recognized that Hoppe’s theory
was a revolutionary advance in libertarian theory, as have a growing
number of adherents over the years. As Rothbard wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and
for libertarianism in particular, he [Hoppe] has managed to transcend
the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy
since the days of the scholastics, and that had brought modern
libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock. Not only that: Hans Hoppe has
managed to establish the case for anarcho-capitalist, Lockean rights in
an unprecedentedly hard-core manner, one that makes my own natural
law/natural rights position seem almost wimpy in comparison.<a
href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the original article upon which this chapter is based was
published, there have been many more contributions expanding on and
defending Hoppe’s argumentation ethics. In the years since Hoppe’s
theory was first published, several scholars have worked to defend,
clarify and extend it.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref278" role="doc-noteref"><sup>278</sup></a> I have also
commented and built on Hoppe’s work in my own writing.<a href="#fn279"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>279</sup></a></p>
<p>To fully appreciate Hoppe’s argument and to fairly evaluate MC’s
critique, I suggest reading Hoppe’s own work<a href="#fn280"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280" role="doc-noteref"><sup>280</sup></a>
and various secondary sources.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref281" role="doc-noteref"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="libertarian-rights">LIBERTARIAN RIGHTS</h4>
<p>The central question here is: does Hoppe’s theory establish that
there are libertarian rights?</p>
<p>Scarce (conflictable) resources are those things over which there can
be conflict; two or more individuals may want to use or control a given
scarce resource at the same time, but only one of them can, because use
by one excludes use by the other. Thus, as Hoppe explains, a theory of
interpersonal ethics must be a theory of property rights, “a theory of
the assignment of rights of exclusive control over scarce means.”<a
href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>282</sup></a> The purpose of rights is to
specify which individual has the right to control a given scarce
resource, so that conflicts may be avoided. The person who has the right
to control a given scarce resource—its owner—is the person who is
<em>justified</em> in using the resource, in excluding others, and in
enforcing this exclusion against non-owners who would act in disregard
of the owner’s property rights.</p>
<p>Everyone has at least an implicit view of rights. An aggressor—or at
least one who would try to justify his aggression—maintains that he is
entitled to a given scarce resource “because” he is strong enough to
take it. Others, such as socialists, believe that the state is entitled
to the means of production “because”—well, because they are the state,
“because” capitalists “exploit” workers, and so on. Mainstream
liberal-democratic types believe that, for example, the poor are
entitled to property formerly owned by the not-poor, “because” the
property is transferred from the latter to the former by means of a
democratic process, which is “legitimate.” Everyone assigns each
disputed scarce resource to <em>some</em> owner—whether to a thief, the
state, or a relatively-poor “needy” person—for <em>some</em> reason.</p>
<p>The libertarian view is that each person presumptively owns his own
body, and for other, previously-unowned resources, the owner is
determined in accordance with the principles of original appropriation
and contractual title transfer. Thus, under libertarianism, an
individual has (a) a right to the exclusive control of the scarce
resource of his body, sometimes called “self-ownership”; and (b) a right
to the exclusive control of other, previously-unowned scarce resources
that are originally appropriated by the individual or by his
ancestor-in-title.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
<p>So the question is, does Hoppe’s theory establish that the
libertarian view of rights, as opposed to competing views, is the
correct one?</p>
<h4 id="hoppes-theory-lets-try-again">HOPPE’S THEORY: LET’S TRY
AGAIN</h4>
<p>I do not intend here to restate Hoppe’s entire argument, as I believe
it has been adequately explicated and defended already by Hoppe in the
literature referenced above. And he has already replied to numerous
criticisms, including arguments similar to those leveled by MC.<a
href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>284</sup></a> Instead, I will try to show, as
simply as possible, why Hoppe succeeds. I’ll then address, in view of
this, a few of MC’s concrete critiques, but it should be clear by this
point why I think their criticism is off base.</p>
<p>Hoppe starts by noting that if any proposed theory of rights is going
to be justified, it has to be justified in the course of an argument
(discourse). As Hoppe writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not persons have any rights and, if so, which ones, can
only be decided in the course of argumentation (propositional exchange).
Justification—proof, conjecture, refutation—is <em>argumentative</em>
justification. Anyone who denied this proposition would become involved
in a performative contradiction because his denial would itself
constitute an argument. Even an ethical relativist must accept this
first proposition, which has been referred to as the <em>a priori of
argumentation</em>.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fail to see how MC can disagree with this without falling into
contradiction. It follows that if any norms, ethics, facts, or rules of
discourse are <em>necessarily presupposed</em> by participants in
argumentation simply by virtue of arguing, then no theory that
contradicts these presupposed facts or norms could ever be justified. By
contrast, any proposed theory that is consistent with, indeed implied
by, these presuppositions, would have to be seen as irrefutably
justified. This type of reasoning is called the “apriori of
communication and argumentation,” and was pioneered by German
philosophers Jürgen Habermas (Hoppe’s PhD advisor) and Karl-Otto Apel,
although, unlike Hoppe’s approach, this method was applied by them to
reach non-libertarian (social-democratic) results.</p>
<p>And there certainly are norms presupposed by argumentative
justification as such. As Hoppe writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]rguing never just consists of free-floating propositions claiming
to be true. Rather, argumentation is always an activity, too. But given
that truth claims are raised and decided upon in argumentation and that
argumentation, aside from whatever is said in its course, is a practical
affair, it follows that intersubjectively meaningful norms must
exist—precisely those which make some action an argumentation—which have
special cognitive status in that they are the practical preconditions of
objectivity and truth.</p>
<p>Hence, one reaches the conclusion that norms must indeed be assumed
to be justifiable as valid. It is simply impossible to argue otherwise,
because the ability to argue so would in fact presuppose the validity of
those norms which underlie any argumentation whatsoever. <a
href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>286</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, I fail to see how MC can disagree with any of this, in
general. Rather, the disagreement is over what norms are actually
implicit in the activity of argumention—that is, over what participants
in discourse <em>must presuppose to be true</em> in order to participate
in argumentation. Whatever these presuppositions are, they rule out of
court any proposed norms inconsistent with them. And, any such normative
presuppositions, or norms deduced from these presuppositions, would have
to be considered to be ultimately and irrefutably justified, as their
validity could never be coherently denied.</p>
<h4 id="universalizability-1">UNIVERSALIZABILITY</h4>
<p>So let’s see what Hoppe contends. First, any norm proposed in
argumentation is presumed to be <em>universalizable</em>. Writes
Hoppe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quite commonly it has been observed that argumentation implies that a
proposition claims <em>universal</em> acceptability, or, should it be a
norm proposal, that it is “universalizable.” Applied to norm proposals,
this is the idea, as formulated in the Golden Rule of ethics or in the
Kantian Categorical Imperative, that only those norms can be justified
that can be formulated as general principles which are valid for
everyone without exception.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref287" role="doc-noteref"><sup>287</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, any proposed norm—that is, an attempted justification
for a given action—is not justified if it is not universalizable. This
rule is presupposed by the very attempt to argumentatively justify
something, because “argumentation implies that everyone who can
understand an argument must in principle be able to be convinced of it
<em>simply because of its argumentative force</em>.” Because the
universalizability principle is an inherent feature of argumentation in
general, “the universalization principle of ethics can now be understood
and explained as grounded in the wider ‘apriori of communication and
argumentation.’”<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>288</sup></a> I.e., no one can deny that only
universalizable norms can be justified.<a href="#fn289"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>289</sup></a></p>
<p>So, we have our first presupposition: that only universalizable
ethics can be possible candidates for being justified.<a href="#fn290"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290" role="doc-noteref"><sup>290</sup></a>
By the same token, so-called “particularizable” norms are not
justifiable. However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he universalization principle only provides a purely formal
criterion for morality. To be sure, checked against this criterion all
proposals for valid norms which would specify different rules for
different classes of people could be shown to have no legitimate claim
of being universally acceptable as fair norms, unless the distinction
between different classes of people were such that it implied no
discrimination, but could instead be accepted as founded in the nature
of things again by everyone. But while some norms might not pass the
test of universalization, if enough attention were paid to their
formulation, the most ridiculous norms, and what is of course even more
relevant, even openly incompatible norms could easily and equally well
pass it. For example, “everybody must get drunk on Sundays or be fined”
or “anyone who drinks alcohol will be punished” are both rules that do
not allow discrimination among groups of people and thus could both
claim to satisfy the condition of universalization.</p>
<p>Clearly then, the universalization principle alone would not provide
one with any positive set of norms that could be demonstrated to be
justified.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>291</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even though universalizability is merely a formal requirement, it
does eliminate many proposed norms, such as those underlying most
versions of socialism which amount to “I can hit you but you cannot hit
me” particularizable rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he property theory implicit in socialism does not normally pass
even the first decisive test (the necessary if not sufficient condition)
required of rules of human conduct which claim to be morally justified
or justifiable. This test, as formulated in the so-called golden rule
or, similarly, in the Kantian categorical imperative, requires that in
order to be just, a rule must be a <em>general</em> one applicable to
every single person in the same way. The rule cannot specify different
rights or obligations for different categories of people (one for the
red-headed, and one for others, or one for women and a different one for
men), as such a “particularistic” rule, naturally, could never, not even
in principle, be accepted as a fair rule by everyone. Particularistic
rules, however, of the type “I can hit you, but you are not allowed to
hit me,” are … at the very base of all practiced forms of socialism.<a
href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>292</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus universalizability acts as a first-level “filter” that weeds out
all particularistic norms. This reduces the universe of possibly
justified normative claims but does not finish the job since many
incompatible and unethical norms could be reworded in universalizable
ways.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that Hoppe next examines other, more
substantive, presuppositions inherent in argument itself. These are then
used in a second filtering process to reject additional proposed norms,
those that are universalizable but incompatible with the other
presuppositions of discourse. And, because some of these presuppositions
turn out to be presupposed <em>norms</em>, Hoppe then shows that the
libertarian conception of rights can be deduced from these presupposed
norms and facts.</p>
<h4
id="substantive-facts-and-norms-presupposed-in-argumentation">SUBSTANTIVE
FACTS AND NORMS PRESUPPOSED IN ARGUMENTATION</h4>
<p>The universalization principle filters out many possible norms, but
many possible, mutually incompatible, and nonlibertarian candidates
remain (“anyone who drinks alcohol will be punished”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there are other positive norms implied in argumentation
aside from the universalization principle. In order to recognize them,
it is only necessary to call three interrelated facts to attention.
First, that argumentation is not only a cognitive but also a
<em>practical affair</em>. Second, that argumentation, as a form of
action, implies the use of the <em>scarce resource</em> of one’s body.
And third, that argumentation is a <em>conflict-free</em> way of
interacting.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>293</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants in discourse cannot deny the existence of scarcity
(discourse is a form of action, after all, and action implies scarce
resources, in one’s body and in external objects or means of action) nor
the possibility of conflict over these scarce resources. They also value
the ability to participate in argument (they are engaging in it, after
all) and thus its <em>practical preconditions</em>, namely the ability
to actually use scarce resources in order to survive (for argumentation
is not possible without survival). And because argumentation/discourse
is a cooperative, civilized, peaceful activity, and because “justifying
<em>means</em> justifying without having to rely on coercion,”<a
href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>294</sup></a> participants in discourse
necessarily value being able to use scarce resources in a conflict-free
way. One adopting a civilized, peaceful stance and trying to justify a
norm cannot coherently advocate non-peaceful norms. In fact, the very
attempt to justify a resource allocation norm is an <em>attempt to
settle conflicts</em> with regard to the use of that resource. Thus, a
participant in discourse could never justify the proposition that there
is no value to being able to use resources, or that conflict should not
be avoided, or that cooperation and peacefulness are bad things. Valuing
the avoidance of conflicts also presupposes the value of attempting to
find rules that make conflict avoidance possible. I.e., property
rules.</p>
<p>Accordingly, participants in discourse, in particular those seeking
to justify proposed norms, implicitly recognize the value and legitimacy
of assigning specified property owners to specified scarce resources—for
reasons that are universalizable and that make conflict-avoidance
possible. However, property rights make conflict avoidance possible by
establishing perceivable boundaries to resources indicating the
resource’s borders and who the owner is, and by basing the assignment on
universalizable rules that could be accepted as fair by all potential
participants in discourse, in argumentative justification. For this
reason, the assignment of property rights has to be based on some
<em>objective link</em> between the claimant and a particular
resource.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>295</sup></a></p>
<p>What all this means is that anyone ever attempting to
(argumentatively) justify any norm is already presupposing a host of
norms and argumentative rules. The substantive presupposed norms rule
out many proposed norms, even if they are universalizable. For example,
a rule such as “no one should ever be able to use any scarce resource”
could never be justified. It is incompatible with the speaker’s evident
value for the ability to use scarce resources, because he has to (be
able to) use the scarce resource of his body in order to engage in any
activity, including argumentation. And he, or someone, had to be able to
use other scarce resources such as food, shelter, etc., so that the
arguers are alive and able to argue (remember, discourse is a practical
affair, and requires the speakers to be alive, to have control of their
bodies and their standing room, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, a rule specifying that all resources, or even some
resources, should have no owner at all, simply does not allocate
ownership in the scarce resources at issue, i.e., it does not fulfill
its function of conflict-avoidance. Unless property rights are allocated
to someone, conflict over each scarce resource is possible; that is the
nature of scarcity. (As a practical matter, most such rules also imply
that if a given resource should not be “owned,” then some person or
agency is authorized to <em>prevent</em> others from using the thing. In
which case the rule is, in reality, assigning ownership to the agency
with control and would need to be justified. For example, the public
forests are said (by some libertarians) to be “unowned,” but the federal
government prevents homesteaders from moving in. Clearly here the
federal government is asserting ownership. The necessity of justifying
this cannot be avoided by the fiction that the property is not
owned.)</p>
<p>There is no way any norm can be justified that does not seek to
assign ownership of every scarce resource to particular owners, based on
an objective link between the owner and the owned resource. No rule
could ever be justified if it refrains from deciding who owns a
particular resource or if it specifies that no one owns a resource. And
any justification offered has to be universalizable. The reasons for all
these requirements should be clear by now, as discussed above.
Particular owners must be assigned to each and every scarce
resource—this is what any theory of property—any ethic—has to do. There
must be an objective link between the owner and the resource, so that
conflicts can be avoided, and also to comply with universalizability.
“Every” scarce resource must be owned by someone, for conflict-avoidance
and other reasons given above.</p>
<p>To this point the case is fairly general, and only establishes the
framework for examining various competing norms. The libertarian
insistence on objective links between resources and owners, and its
particular view of what constitutes such objective links, is what
completes the case.</p>
<h4
id="objective-links-first-use-verbal-claims-and-the-prior-later-distinction">OBJECTIVE
LINKS: FIRST USE, VERBAL CLAIMS, AND THE PRIOR-LATER DISTINCTION</h4>
<p>So now we come to libertarianism. It turns out that libertarianism is
the only theory of rights that satisfies the presuppositions of
discourse, because only it advocates assigning ownership by means of
objective links between the owner and the resource in question.</p>
<p>Hoppe first establishes property rights in bodies. As noted above,<a
href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>296</sup></a> argumentation is a
<em>conflict-free</em> way of interacting, and justifying means
justifying without having to rely on coercion. In other words, the
nonaggression principle is presupposed in argumentation. Thus, in the
case of one’s own body, the rule of “self-ownership” is implied, since
saying that a participant in discourse is not permitted to aggress
against the body of other participants is tantamount to recognizing a
property right in each participant’s body. The nonaggression principle
and self- (body-) ownership are just different ways of expressing the
same idea. The objective link here is each person’s control over and
identification with his own body.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref297" role="doc-noteref"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
<p>As for previously-unowned, external scarce resources, the objective
link that is relevant to property rights is first use, or original
appropriation. Only the norm assigning ownership in a thing to its
<em>first user</em>, or his transferee in title, could fulfill this
requirement, or the other presuppositions of argumentation.</p>
<p>There is clearly an objective link between the person who first
begins to use something, and emborders it, and all others in the world.
Everyone can see this. No goods are ever subject to conflict unless they
are first acquired by someone. The first user and possessor of a good is
either its owner or he is not. If he is not, then who is? The person who
takes it from him by force? If forcefully taking possession from a prior
owner entitles the new possessor to the thing, then <em>there is no such
thing as ownership</em>, but only mere possession.<a href="#fn298"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298" role="doc-noteref"><sup>298</sup></a>
But such a rule—that a later user may acquire something by taking it
from the previous owner—does not avoid conflicts, it rather authorizes
them. It is nothing more than mights-makes-right writ large. This is not
what peaceful, cooperative, conflict-free argumentative justification is
about.</p>
<p>What about the person who verbally <em>declares</em> that he owns the
good that another has appropriated? Again, this rule is not justifiable
because it does not avoid conflicts—because everyone in the world can
simultaneously decree that they own any thing. With multiple claimants
for a piece of property, each having an “equally good” verbal decree,
there is no way to avoid conflict by allocating ownership to a
particular person. No way, other than an objective link, that is, which
again shows why there must be an objective link between the claimant and
the resource.</p>
<p>As Hoppe states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, the right to acquire such goods must be assumed to exist. Now,
if this is so, and if one does not have the right to acquire such rights
of exclusive control over unused, nature-given things through one’s own
work, i.e., by doing something with things with which no one else had
ever done anything before, and if other people had the right to
disregard one’s ownership claim with respect to such things which they
had not worked on or put to some particular use before, then this would
only be possible if one could acquire property titles not through labor,
i.e., by establishing some objective, intersubjectively controllable
link between a particular person and a particular scarce resource, but
simply by verbal declaration; by decree…. The separation is based on the
observation that some particular scarce resource had in fact—for
everyone to see and verify, as objective indicators for this would
exist—been made an expression or materialization of one’s own will, or,
as the case may be, of someone else’s will.<a href="#fn299"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>299</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Hoppe notes, assigning ownership based on verbal decree would be
incompatible with the “nonaggression principle regarding bodies,” which
is presupposed due to the cooperative, peaceful, conflict-free nature of
argumentative justification. Moreover, it would not address the problem
of conflict avoidance, as explained above.</p>
<p>Thus, Hoppe is correct, when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, one is forced to conclude that the socialist ethic is a
complete failure. In all of its practical versions, it is no better than
a rule such as “I can hit you, but you cannot hit me,” which even fails
to pass the universalization test. And if it did adopt universalizable
rules, which would basically amount to saying “everybody can hit
everybody else,” such rulings could not conceivably be said to be
universally acceptable on account of their very material specification.
Simply to say and argue so must presuppose a person’s property right
over his own body. Thus, only the first-come-first-own ethic of
capitalism can be defended effectively as it is implied in
argumentation. And no other ethic could be so justified, as justifying
something in the course of argumentation implies presupposing the
validity of precisely this ethic of the natural theory of property.<a
href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>300</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, cognition and truth-seeking as such have a normative
foundation, and the normative foundation on which cognition and truth
rest is the recognition of private property rights.<a href="#fn301"

<h4 id="murphys-callahans-critique">MURPHY’S &amp; CALLAHAN’S
CRITIQUE</h4>
<p>I am really at a loss as to where MC would part company with this
theory. Do they deny, for example, that there is scarcity in the world
or that conflicts are possible? I doubt it. Do they deny that
universalizability is a requirement for justified norms? I doubt it,
unless they are also ethical skeptics, in which case I wonder why they
consider themselves libertarians.<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref302" role="doc-noteref"><sup>302</sup></a> Do they deny that
rights have to be justified, and that justification has to occur during
argument? Such a denial would be a neat trick, as it would itself be an
argument. Do they maintain that participants in discourse do not
presuppose <em>any</em> truths?—or do they just say that none of these
are <em>normative</em>? Or do they think that argumentation is not a
conflict-free way of interacting?—in which case they would seem to think
bashing someone over the head or stealing their wallet is also a form of
peaceful, cooperative discourse.</p>
<p>Or, do they think it is coherent for a participant in the peaceful,
cooperative activity of discourse, while searching with the other for a
universalizable, conflict-avoiding property allocation rule, to advocate
socialism, or any other non-libertarian approach? If they are
libertarians surely there must be <em>some</em> advantage to libertarian
rights that would factor in to such a generalized argumentative
justification context. Or, would MC seriously maintain that a norm could
be argumentatively justified, if the norm, if followed, would render
human life, and thus argumentative justification itself, impossible?<a
href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>303</sup></a></p>
<p>MC do not attempt to debunk argumentation ethics in general, or,
alternatively, to show just what ethics <em>are</em> implied in
argumentation (and why these are not the ones that Hoppe proposes). Do
they believe <em>any</em> norms are implied in argumentation? If not,
they would seem to reject the entire edifice of work in this regard,
including work by Jürgen Habermas, Karl-Otto Apel, Frank van Dun, G.B.
Madison, Alan Gewirth, Roger Pilon, Tibor Machan, and others discussed
in “Dialogical Arguments for Libertarian Rights” (ch. 6).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if they accept that argumentation implies
<em>some</em> norms, which are they? Do these norms support
libertarianism? Socialism? Or are they only non-rights-related
interpersonal norms, like “be nice” or “don’t lie”?<a href="#fn304"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304" role="doc-noteref"><sup>304</sup></a>
Are these argumentatively-presupposed norms at least consistent with
libertarianism? MC write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hoppe next invokes the “ethics of argumentation,” which was developed
by Habermas and Apel…. They contend that whenever people are engaged in
debate, they have implicitly agreed to a certain set of norms, for
example, that they will restrict themselves to peaceful means in their
efforts to persuade other participants of their contentions. [54]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not clear whether MC are merely paraphrasing this basic insight
or whether they agree with it. If they do, are there <em>no</em>
implications to be drawn from this? Does it place no constraints
whatsoever on the legitimacy of norms propositionally advanced in the
course of (peaceful!) argument? After all, later they say “Hoppe has
shown that bashing someone on the head is an illogical form of
argumentation.” (p. 58) Does this concede that argumentation does
presuppose some norms? It’s not clear.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if MC accept any form of argumentation ethics as
valid—that is, if there are some norms implied in discourse—then, as
libertarians who believe libertarian norms <em>are</em> (somehow)
justified, they would have to believe that the argumentative norms are
at least compatible with, if not the grounding for, libertarian rights.
That is, if you accept that there are some norms presupposed by
argumentative justification, <em>and</em> if you yourself accept
libertarian norms, you must believe that the norms of argumentation
ethics are at least compatible with, and possibly relevant to, the
greater set of libertarian norms.</p>
<h4 id="universalizability-2"><em>Universalizability</em></h4>
<p>What about universalizability? I am not sure if MC really reject the
universalizability requirement—but if they do, I fail to see how they
can themselves adhere to any notion of rights; rejecting
universalizability means that any norm whatsoever can be proposed by
simply making up a particularistic reason for it. Without the
universalizability principle, literally “anything goes,” which of course
leads to ethical relativism and/or skepticism. I will assume that MC are
not ethical relativists or skeptics and thus do not reject
universalizability. But I am not sure they fully appreciate this
principle.</p>
<p>Consider this comment by MC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To simply declare that ownership rights must be “universalizable” is
no help, either; after all, communists could cite the same principle to
“prove” that everyone should have equal shares to all property. [59
n.3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MC write here as if they are totally unaware that Hoppe has
explicitly stated that “the universalization principle only provides a
<em>purely formal criterion for morality</em>.”<a href="#fn305"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305" role="doc-noteref"><sup>305</sup></a>
Of course, even if socialism’s principles were reformulated in a
completely universalizable way, it will still be inconsistent with other
norms presupposed in argumentation, as noted above.</p>
<p>And regarding universalizability, MC also state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our final point in this section is to note that, even setting aside
all of the above difficulties, it’s still the case that Hoppe has only
proven self-ownership for the individuals in the debate. This is
because, even on Hoppe’s own grounds, someone denying the libertarian
ethic would only be engaging in contradiction if he tried to justify his
preferred doctrine to its “victims.”</p>
<p>For example, so long as Aristotle only argued with other Greeks about
the inferiority of barbarians and their natural status as slaves, then
he would not be engaging in a performative contradiction. He could quite
consistently grant self-ownership to his Greek debating opponent, while
denying it to those whom he deems naturally inferior…. Aristotle need
only contend [that] barbarians [] are not as rational as Greeks. [58,
59]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do MC think that merely “deeming” or “contending” something to be so
is automatically compatible with universalizability? I believe they are
simply misapplying the universalizability principle here (or, rather,
failing to apply it). For Aristotle to grant rights to himself and
Greeks, but not to other individuals, would simply be particularistic.
He would have to show that there is some reason, objectively grounded in
the nature of things, that justifies rights in Greeks but not in other
people identical to Greeks in all respects <em>except for</em> their
Greekness. Again, either the universalizability requirement is taken
seriously, or it is not. If not, the door to ethical skepticism is
opened wide.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>306</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, I would assume MC themselves do <em>not</em> agree that one
can mount a viable argument that Greeks have rights (for some reason)
but other humans do not. So why would they think it’s “consistent” to
make such an argument, when even they would (presumably) disagree with
such an argument?</p>
<h4 id="entire-body-vs.-parts-of-the-body"><em>Entire Body vs. Parts of
the Body</em></h4>
<p>One criticism MC make is the argument that Hoppe has not succeeded in
arguing for ownership of one’s entire body, but, at best, only parts of
it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At best, all Hoppe has proven is that it would be a performative
contradiction for someone to deny in an argument that his debating
opponent (and perhaps those in the same “class”) own the body parts
(such as eyes, brain, and lungs) necessary for debate, for the duration
of the debate. This is a far cry from showing that it would be a
contradiction for someone to deny the case for libertarianism. In
particular, a collectivist could argue that people can rightfully be
forced to give up a kidney, or go to war, if such actions would help the
rest of society. [60]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe has subsequently responded to this type of argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some critics have argued that this does not demonstrate a person’s
ownership of his entire body, but at best only of parts of it. Why?
Because to argue it is not necessary to use all body parts. And true
enough, you do not need two kidneys, two eyes or an appendix to argue.
Indeed, you also do not need your body hair or even arms and legs to
argue. And hence, according to such critics, you cannot claim to be the
lawful owner of your two kidneys or eyes, your legs and arms. Yet this
objection does not only appear silly on its face—after all, it implies
the recognition of these “un-necessary” parts as <em>natural parts of
one unitary body</em> rather than as separate, stand-alone entities.
More importantly, it involves, philosophically speaking, a category
mistake. The critics simply confuse the <em>physiology</em> of
argumentation and action with the <em>logic</em> of argumentation and
action. And this confusion is particularly surprising coming from
economists, and even more so from economists familiar also with
praxeology. For the fundamental distinction made in economics between
“labor” and “land” as the two originary means of production, which
corresponds exactly to the distinction made here between “body” and
“external world,” is also not a physiological or physicalistic
distinction, but a praxeological one.</p>
<p>The question to be answered is not: which body parts are
physiologically necessary requirements for one person arguing with
another person. Rather, the question is: which parts of my body and
which parts of your body can I or you argumentatively justify as my or
your lawful possessions. And to this a clear and unambiguous answer
exists. I am the lawful owner of my nature-given body with everything
naturally in it and attached to it, and you are the lawful owner of your
entire nature-given body. Any argument to the contrary would land its
proponent in a performative or dialectic contradiction. For me to say,
for instance, in an argumentation with you, that you do not rightfully
own all of your nature-given body is contradicted by the fact that in so
arguing, not fighting, with you, I must recognize and treat you as
another person with a separate body and recognizably separate physical
boundaries and borders from me and my body. To argue that you do not
lawfully own your entire natural body, which you actually possess and
have peacefully taken into possession before I could have possibly done
so indirectly by means of my natural body, is to advocate conflict and
bodily clash and hence contrary to the purpose of argumentation: of
peacefully resolving a present conflict and avoiding future conflict.<a

<h4 id="arguing-with-your-slave"><em>Arguing With Your Slave</em></h4>
<p>MC introduce supposed “counterexamples” of God and slavery. Take the
slavery case. They recognize that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hoppe and Rothbardian libertarians in general do <em>not</em> believe
in universal self-ownership. In particular, they believe that
<em>criminals</em> may be rightfully enslaved to pay off their debts to
victims (or their heirs). [62]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, of course! Hoppe is a libertarian. To advocate self-ownership
means that a person has the right to control his body, as a default or
<em>prima facie</em> matter. But if someone commits aggression, of
course the victim now is a partial “owner” of the aggressor’s body,
because he has a right to use force against it. So consider a man who
now “owns” an aggressor who, say, murdered the man’s wife. Of course,
the owner could engage in debate with the slave, but only by granting
the slave the right to use his body for purposes of argument. But how
does this change the fact that no one can argumentatively deny the
normative presuppositions that imply libertarianism? Let’s assume the
owner is libertarian. He believes in the need for property rules and
conflict-avoidance. He believes any norms have to be universalizable. If
he advocated socialism, his argument would be incompatible with
necessary argumentative presuppositions of peace, prosperity, and
conflict-avoiding prosperity—because socialist rules are either not
universalizable or are not based on objective links between owner and
resource.</p>
<p>But his claim that he has a right to wield force against the slave is
perfectly justified. It is universalizable, because the different
treatment of the slave-aggressor and the master-victim is not arbitrary
but is grounded in the objective fact of the act of aggression. It is
compatible with objectively assigning property rights, because it is a
way of <em>enforcing</em> objectively assigned property rights that are
violated.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>308</sup></a></p>
<p>And another way to look at this issue is this. As pointed out in
chapter 4 (n.17), and as alluded to by Hoppe in the quote at note 35,
above, and also his comments in the Foreword, the reasons for the
self-ownership norm is that a person’s direct control over his own body
has logical-temporal priority over the control by another person which
must be <em>indirect</em>. Since the person always maintains direct
control, another person attempting to control the person’s body by
indirect control (basically, coercion) will always, necessarily,
generate conflict. But the purpose of property norms is to reduce
conflict or allow conflict to be avoided. So one of the reasons the
slavery-norm cannot be accepted as justified is that it generates
conflict. (There are other, interrelated reasons as well, such as:
someone claiming ownership of another by indirect control claims
ownership of his own body due to direct control; so it is contradictory
to deny the same right to the other person.)</p>
<p>Now when the victim of a crime seeks to enslave the criminal, it is
true that this will be a conflict: the indirect control of the victim
will clash with the direct control of the criminal over his own body.
Yet it is too late to avoid conflict; the criminal’s criminal act was
already an act of conflict. So now we do not have two peaceful people
seeking a conflict-reducing norm to allow them to live peacefully
together. Now we have a victim of aggression and conflict who seeks to
obtain some kind of rectification from the aggressor, <em>even if</em>
that involves violently coercing or dominating the aggressor,
overwhelming his direct control with indirect control via coercion. So
there is no contradiction in Hoppe’s theory in opposing the slavery-norm
as being contradictory and granting the legitimacy of a type of slavery
in limited situations. In the first case, Hoppe is observing that a
property norm aimed at reducing conflict cannot be justified if it sets
up conflict. In the second case, conflict has already happened and now
the victim is not seeking to avoid conflict but is instead seeking
restitution.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>309</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="god-as-slaveowner"><em>God as Slaveowner</em></h4>
<p>As for God—you can’t just <em>posit</em> that God owns everyone and
“therefore” we are not self-owners. Moreover, even if God <em>does</em>
own us, then this would be because God has some objective link that
gives him a better claim or title to a person’s body than this person
has—some kind of logical-temporal priority that takes precedence over
the person’s own claims to own his body because of his direct control of
his body. If we are positing this kind of magic, then God himself might
have a sort of “super” direct control over our bodies that gives him a
better claim. For example, as Hoppe points out (note the text I have
italicized):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer to the question what makes my body “mine” lies in the
obvious fact that this is not merely an assertion but that, for everyone
to see, this <em>is</em> indeed the case. Why do we say “this is my
body”? For this a twofold requirement exists. On the one hand it must be
the case that the body called “mine” must indeed (in an
intersubjectively ascertainable way) express or “objectify” my will.
Proof of this, as far as my body is concerned, is easy enough to
demonstrate: When I announce that I will now lift my arm, turn my head,
relax in my chair (or whatever else) and these announcements then become
true (are fulfilled), then this shows that the body which does this has
been indeed appropriated by my will. If, to the contrary, my
announcements showed no systematic relation to my body’s actual
behavior, then the proposition “this is my body” would have to be
considered as an empty, objectively unfounded assertion; and likewise
this proposition would be rejected as incorrect if following my
announcement not my arm would rise but always that of Müller, Meier, or
Schulze (<em>in which case one would more likely be inclined to consider
Müller’s, Meier’s, or Schulze’s body “mine”</em>).<a href="#fn310"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>310</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Hoppe’s italicized example here is not intended to be realistic,
anymore than the hypothetical construct of the “evenly rotating
economy,” or ERE, employed by Mises and Rothbard; or the magical world
of the Garden of Eden or the Land of Cockaigne (or Schlaraffenland), in
which there is no scarcity or conflict possible, but in which human
action is also virtually inconceivable.<a href="#fn311"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311" role="doc-noteref"><sup>311</sup></a>
(This is unlike Robinsonades, which analyze the economic implications of
the actions of Crusoe alone on his island, which is not unrealistic at
all, just highly simplified.)<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref312" role="doc-noteref"><sup>312</sup></a> It was merely a way
to emphasis the crucial centrality of direct control with a somewhat
unrealistic and whimsical hypothetical. Likewise, until someone can
prove there is a God, and that he owns us, I fail to see the relevance
of this example. In any case, as Locke argues, God “gave” self-ownership
to each person, “manumitting” them in a sense.<a href="#fn313"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313" role="doc-noteref"><sup>313</sup></a>
Notes Van Dun in this regard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume that Murphy and Callahan refer to a theist in the
Judeo-Christian tradition: Would God claim justifiable possession or
control of a creature that He put out of his Garden when He discovered
that it was capable of reason and free will? What does all the biblical
talk about Covenants mean if we are asked to consider a covenant between
an owner and his property?<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref314" role="doc-noteref"><sup>314</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Dun also observes that MC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fail to note the difference between arguing about God and arguing
with God. The question of God’s ownership would have to be decided in an
argumentation with God, not with any self-proclaimed representative of
God, who would have a hard time proving his credentials anyway—so much
so that it is doubtful that he would ever get to discuss the question of
God’s ownership itself. The same applies to discussions about Society or
The People’s having ultimate ownership of our bodies or other things.<a
href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>315</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the purpose of property rights and human law is to govern
interpersonal behavior among human beings, here on earth. Even if there
is a God out there that has some kind of super-ownership claim over us,
as his subjects or creations, within the human realm and among other
humans, we are still self-owners <em>vis-à-vis</em> each other. As
Walter Block observes, “libertarianism is a theory that concerns the
relationship between man and man, not between man and God.”<a
href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>316</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the positing of a hypothetical God in no way refutes the
conclusion that only the libertarian norms, including especially
self-ownership, can be argumentatively justified amongst fellow
humans.</p>
<h4 id="claims-made-during-argumentation-only"><em>Claims Made During
Argumentation Only</em></h4>
<p>MC try to make much of their notion that propositions advanced
“during” argument are not subject to the presuppositions of argument if
the rule is designed to be applied in a non-argumentative context. But
propositions <em>can only</em> be justified during argumentation. A
participant in discourse cannot deny that conflict-avoidance is good.
<em>When he seeks to justify something</em>, it is always some action he
seeks to justify. The justification takes place at one time; the action
to be justified, at another. So what? Are MC saying that <em>no</em>
action can ever be justified, other than argument itself? Consider an
act of theft, or property acquisition, or rape: all non-argumentative
actions. Obviously, these actions are not justifying-actions, because
they are not arguments. The only time they could possibly be justified,
or criticized, is at another time, during argument. In any event, this
critique seems to miss the point. As Hoppe notes: “In the same way as
the validity of a mathematical proof is not restricted to the moment of
proving it, so is the validity of the libertarian property theory not
limited to instances of argumentation. If correct, the argument
demonstrates its universal justification.”<a href="#fn317"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>317</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, if two people seek to agree upon a fair, universalizable rule
for assigning property rights in scarce resources to individuals in a
way that would allow conflict to be avoided and the resources to be
used—of course the rule they are considering will be applicable to
future property disputes. I am baffled at how they could think
otherwise.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"

<h4 id="praxeology-and-legal-analysis-action-vs.-behavior">PRAXEOLOGY
AND LEGAL ANALYSIS: ACTION VS. BEHAVIOR</h4>
<p>For libertarians, the purpose of a legal system is to establish and
enforce rules that facilitate and support peaceful, conflict-free
interaction between individuals, i.e., property rights. In short, the
law should prohibit aggression—the unconsented-to use of someone’s owned
resources, or “property”—by identifying and protecting private property
rights.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>319</sup></a> Because aggression is a particular
kind of human action—action that intentionally violates or threatens to
violate the physical integrity of another person or another person’s
property without that person’s consent<a href="#fn320"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>320</sup></a>—it can be successfully prohibited
only if the law is based on a sound understanding of the nature of human
action more generally.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref321" role="doc-noteref"><sup>321</sup></a></p>
<p>Praxeology, the general theory of human action, studies the universal
features of human action and draws out the logical implications of the
undeniable fact that humans act.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref322" role="doc-noteref"><sup>322</sup></a> Praxeology is
central to Austrian economics, the “hitherto best elaborated part” of
the science of praxeology.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref323" role="doc-noteref"><sup>323</sup></a> However, other
disciplines can benefit from the insights of praxeology. Hans-Hermann
Hoppe has already extended praxeology to the field of political
ethics.<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>324</sup></a> The related discipline of legal
theory, which also concerns ethical implications of human action, can
also benefit from the insights of praxeology.<a href="#fn325"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>325</sup></a></p>
<p>In the context of legal analysis, one important praxeological
doctrine is the distinction between action and mere behavior. The
difference between action and behavior boils down to intent. Action is
an individual’s <em>intentional</em> intervention in the physical world,
via certain selected <em>means</em>, with the <em>purpose</em> of
attaining a state of affairs that is preferable to the conditions that
would prevail in the absence of the action. Mere behavior, by contrast,
is a person’s physical movements that are not undertaken intentionally
and that do not manifest any purpose, plan, or design. Mere behavior
cannot be aggression; aggression must be deliberate, it must be an
action.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>326</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to better understand this distinction between action and
behavior, we may focus on the role of causality in explaining each.
Human action involves two-fold causality. On the one hand, human action
requires that time-invariant causal relations govern the physical world.
Otherwise, a given means could not be said to <em>achieve</em> a desired
result. “As no action could be devised and ventured upon without
definite ideas about the relation of cause and effect, teleology
presupposes causality.” <a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref327" role="doc-noteref"><sup>327</sup></a></p>
<p>And on the other hand, human action requires that those
time-invariant causal relations can be understood and exploited by an
individual whose actions are not themselves subject to time-invariant
causal relations. Otherwise, there would be nothing to distinguish human
action from blind natural forces. In such a world, laws and norms would
be pointless, because no one could be considered responsible for his
actions—human beings would not be actors but passive conduits for
mechanical processes.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>328</sup></a></p>
<p>To some extent, of course, human beings are just that. Not everything
we do is intentional; we also exhibit what is mere (i.e.,
non-purposeful) <em>behavior</em>. Our hearts beat, our eyes blink, and
we fall asleep—all without any intention on our part. In these cases, we
can understand the behavior in terms of time-invariant physical causes.
There is no need to apply the concept of an actor deliberately choosing
and employing means for the purpose of attaining a desired end. We can
understand human behavior exactly the same way we can understand any
nonhuman natural (i.e., nonteleological) process. But unlike most
natural processes, human beings are capable of more than mere behavior;
they are capable also of action, of purposeful behavior.</p>
<p>As legal theorists, therefore, we cannot accept an entirely
mechanistic picture of the world. Legal theorizing is concerned with the
ethical or normative implications of action.<a href="#fn329"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329" role="doc-noteref"><sup>329</sup></a>
It asks whether an actor should be held responsible for the consequences
of his actions and what rights to respond his actions give rise to on
the part of the recipients of his action. And to hold someone
responsible for the consequences of his actions is implicitly to invoke
the two-fold concept of causality expressed above. For there even to be
consequences in the first place, the physical world must be governed by
time-invariant causal relations. And to hold an actor responsible for
those consequences, we must determine that they can be traced back to
his own deliberate use of means to achieve a desired result: his
“action” cannot itself be a merely mechanical response to physical
stimuli; he is the author, or “cause,” of the results achieved.<a
href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>330</sup></a> In other words, like Austrian
economics, legal theory must presuppose both time-invariant causation
(an actor could not <em>employ</em> <em>means</em> to attain his goal
otherwise) and agent-causation in which the actor himself is the
<em>cause</em> of results that he intended to achieve by the use of
certain means (the actor is not <em>acting</em> otherwise).</p>
<p>The law, therefore, in prohibiting aggression, is concerned with
prohibiting aggressive <em>action</em>—nonconsensual violations of
property boundaries that are the product of deliberate action. Analyzing
action in view of its praxeological structure is essential.</p>
<h4 id="aggression-and-the-implicit-concept-of-causality">AGGRESSION AND
THE IMPLICIT CONCEPT OF CAUSALITY</h4>
<p>Hitting someone without permission is an example of the kind of
aggression libertarians oppose. If it is illegal to hit someone,
however, this means that it is illegal to <em>cause</em> another person
to be hit; that is to say, it is illegal to use physical objects,
including one’s fist, in a way that will cause unwanted physical contact
with another person. Therefore, if <em>A</em> does
<em>intentionally</em> (and uninvitedly) hit <em>B</em>, he can be held
responsible for the action—the aggression can be imputed to him and he
can be lawfully punished for it—because <em>A</em>’s decision to hit his
victim was not itself conditioned by strictly physical laws. It was
volitional. <em>A</em>—not some impersonal force of nature, and not some
other person—was the cause of the aggression against <em>B</em>.
<em>A</em>’s aggression is an action.<a href="#fn331"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>331</sup></a></p>
<p>The general question facing libertarians, then, is whether a
particular actor, by his action, intentionally <em>caused</em> the
prohibited result—an uninvited border-crossing. Implicitly, the
libertarian prohibition on the initiation of force is a prohibition on
willfully <em>causing</em> an unwanted intrusion.</p>
<p>Where <em>A</em>’s action—not mere behavior—is the cause of
aggression against <em>B</em>, we might simply say that “<em>A</em>
killed <em>B</em>.” But if we unpack this statement, we will usually
find that <em>A</em> did not directly kill <em>B</em>; some intermediate
means was employed to achieve that end (hence the causal aspect of
action). Action is not just intentional; it is the intentional use of
<em>means</em> to attain a desired end. For example, <em>A</em>
deliberately loaded his gun, deliberately pointed the gun at <em>B</em>
and then deliberately squeezed the trigger, causing a bullet to
discharge into <em>B</em>’s heart. Why say that <em>A</em> killed
<em>B</em>? Why not say that the <em>bullet</em> killed <em>B</em>,
whereas <em>A</em> merely squeezed a trigger? Why connect <em>A</em>’s
action of squeezing a trigger with the resulting harm to <em>B</em>? In
some contexts, of course, <em>A</em>’s action would be irrelevant. To a
medical examiner conducting an autopsy, for instance, the bullet is the
cause of <em>B</em>’s death, and who fired it and why is beside the
point. But that does not change the fact that in a legal and normative
context we trace the chain of causation back to <em>A</em>’s intentional
action of squeezing the trigger. There is, after all, a causal
connection between the immediate action and the means employed on the
one hand, and the harmful consequence on the other hand.<a href="#fn332"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>332</sup></a></p>
<p>In praxeological terms, we can say that <em>A</em>’s goal or end was
to kill <em>B</em>; he selected a means—the gun—calculated and designed,
according to known laws of cause and effect in the physical world (the
causal realm), to achieve that goal. <em>A</em>’s action was intended to
cause <em>B</em>’s death, and the action employed means that did, in
fact, result in <em>B</em>’s death. As shorthand we say that <em>A</em>
killed <em>B</em>, but implicit in this account is that <em>A</em>
undertook an intentional action employing means and exploiting causal
laws (causal realm) to achieve his desired result (teleological
realm).<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>333</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point, we might want to revisit the issue of intent. Why
should we concern ourselves with <em>A</em>’s <em>intent</em>? If we
objectively determine that <em>A</em>’s actions caused the death of
<em>B</em>, what should it matter what <em>A</em> intended to do—or
whether <em>A</em> intended to do anything at all?</p>
<p>Intent matters because without intent there is no action and without
action there is no actor to whom we may impute legal responsibility. If
<em>A</em> did not intend to do anything at all, then we cannot
determine that <em>A</em>’s actions caused the death of
<em>B</em>—because <em>A</em> <em>took</em> no action. Intent is a
necessary ingredient in human action; if there is no intent, then there
is no action, only behavior: involuntary physical movements guided by
deterministic (or perhaps random) causal relations.</p>
<p>The role of law in a free society is to protect the rights of
nonaggressors and, where those rights are violated, to compensate the
victims and punish the aggressors. But aggression must be
intentional—otherwise, there is no reason to attribute it to a
particular human actor instead of an impersonal natural force. For
person <em>A</em> to be the cause of <em>B</em>’s death, <em>B</em> must
have died as the result of a series of events initiated by <em>A</em>’s
willful action. If, on the other hand, <em>B</em> dies as the result of
a thoroughly deterministic process unconnected with any willful action,
then there is no one to punish; no one caused <em>B</em>’s death. To
punish <em>A</em>’s unintentional bodily movement would be like
punishing lightning for destruction of property or punishing a flood for
assault. <em>A</em> can murder <em>B</em>, whereas lightning (or a
flood, or a cougar, or an involuntary human reflex) cannot.</p>
<h4 id="punishing-aggression">PUNISHING AGGRESSION</h4>
<p>There is another, closely related reason why intent matters for the
assessment of criminal guilt. A guilty criminal—that is, an
aggressor—may be lawfully punished. Or, to put it another way, an
aggressor cannot meaningfully object when his aggression is met with
physical force in response. After all, his aggressive actions
conclusively demonstrate that he does not find nonconsensual physical
force objectionable. In common law terms, we may say that by virtue of
his own violence against others, an aggressor is “estopped” from
objecting to (proportional) violence against himself.<a href="#fn334"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334" role="doc-noteref"><sup>334</sup></a>
But to punish someone is to engage in an <em>intentional</em> act. As an
intentional act, punishment is only justified in response to an
intentional act of violence; this is the elegant symmetry of libertarian
ethics. Neither an unintentional movement, nor an intentional act of
<em>nonaggression</em>, can justify the use of force. We may punish
<em>A</em> if he intentionally strikes <em>B</em>, but not if <em>B</em>
is struck by lightning; and we may punish <em>A</em> if he intentionally
shoots <em>B</em> with a gun, but not if he shoots <em>B</em> with a
camera. If we do punish <em>A</em> for nonaggression, we become
aggressors ourselves—because nonaggressive action cannot estop A from
mounting a coherent objection to the use of violence against him. Thus
we can say that when an aggressor intentionally and uninvitedly attempts
to (or does) impair the physical integrity of another’s person or
property, he gives his victim the right to punish him, because he can no
longer withhold his consent to physical force in response to his
initiatory force.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"

id="complicating-the-picture-causation-cooperation-and-human-means">COMPLICATING
THE PICTURE: CAUSATION, COOPERATION, AND HUMAN MEANS</h4>
<p>Compared to many real-world cases of murder, the above example in
which <em>A</em> deliberately shoots <em>B</em> is simple and
straightforward. After all, <em>A</em>’s chosen means of carrying out
his aggression against <em>B</em> was a gun—an inanimate object enmeshed
in a web of causal relations but incapable of initiating a causal
sequence on its own. As the well-known slogan goes, guns don’t kill
people, people kill people. There is little difficulty in laying the
moral and legal responsibility for the murder on <em>A</em>, therefore,
because only <em>A</em> engaged in an action. Only <em>A</em> made a
choice to which moral and legal blame could attach. The means that
<em>A</em> employed—the gun and its ammunition—were physical objects
completely bound by causal laws.</p>
<p>What about actions that involve other humans? As Mises observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A means is what serves to the attainment of any end, goal, or aim.
Means are not in the given universe; in this universe there exist only
things. A thing becomes a means when human reason plans to employ it for
the attainment of some end and human action really employs it for this
purpose. Thinking man sees the serviceableness of things, i.e., their
ability to minister to his ends, and acting man makes them means…. It is
human meaning and action which transform them into means.<a
href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>336</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now in these comments Mises is primarily concerned with the use of
nonhuman scarce resources as the things employed as means. But there is
no reason that other humans cannot also be one’s means, in a sense. What
else does it mean to “employ” a worker, or to cooperate with others to
produce wealth? In fact, as Mises commented in <em>Socialism</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n the means of production <em>men serve as means</em>, not as
ends. For liberal social theory proves that each single man sees in all
others, first of all, only means to the realization of his purposes,
while he himself is to all others a means to the realization of their
purposes; that finally, by this reciprocal action, in which each is
simultaneously means and end, the highest aim of social life is
attained—the achievement of a better existence for everyone.<a
href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>337</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that cooperative, productive action is possible, in
which case multiple actors cooperate with each other and, in a sense,
employ each other as means to achieve mutual and/or separate goals. But
not all cooperative action is productive and peaceful. It is also
possible for multiple actors to collaborate or conspire together to
trespass against others’ property rights.</p>
<p>In analyzing action through the lens of the praxeological means-ends
structure to determine if it amounts to aggression, we ask if the actor
employed <em>means</em> to achieve the end of invading the borders of
another’s property or body—in other words, we ask if he <em>caused</em>
the border invasion or trespass. The means employed can be inanimate or
nonhuman means governed solely by causal laws (a gun), <em>or</em> it
can include other humans who are employed (used) as means to achieve the
illicit end desired. The latter category includes both innocent humans
that one employs to cause a border invasion as well as culpable humans
that one conspires (cooperates) with to achieve the illicit end.</p>
<p>Consider the following case in which an aggressor employs an innocent
human as one of his means. A terrorist builds a letter-bomb and mails it
to his intended victim via courier. The courier has no idea that the
package he is delivering contains a lethal device. When the addressee
dies in an explosion after he opens the package, whom should we hold
responsible? The obvious answer is: the terrorist. Why not the courier?
Or the victim himself? After all, the courier is causally connected to
the killing, as is the victim. The courier delivered the package; the
victim opened it. But because he did not know he was carrying a bomb,
the courier did not have the intent to aggress against the victim.
Instead, he was connected to the killing only as a means. When the bomb
exploded, it was the terrorist’s action, not the courier’s, that was
completed. The courier simply handed over a package. The terrorist, by
contrast, intentionally used means—the bomb materials, but also the
unwitting courier—to cause his victim’s death. It is no different than
if the terrorist used a nonhuman robot or drone to deliver the bomb.
This case would be similar to the gun example, but not significantly
different from the case in which a human courier was employed. From the
point of view of both the victim, and the terrorist, whether the means
employed was an innocent human or a nonhuman mechanistic delivery
mechanism is irrelevant. The victim opposes being harmed in both cases;
and the terrorist achieves his end, in both cases.<a href="#fn338"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>338</sup></a></p>
<p>In fact, the victim’s own actions play a role in this scenario—after
all, he opens the package, “causing” it to explode. We would not
hesitate to say that the terrorist killed the victim, even though there
is a significant time lag between the terrorist’s initial actions and
the ensuing result, <em>and even though the victim’s own volitional
actions were part of the chain of events.</em> So why not blame the
victim? After all, he is the one who set off the bomb by opening the
package. But this is obviously absurd. The victim did not intend to kill
himself!</p>
<p>It is true that the positive law has long recognized that one accused
of a crime or tort is not responsible if the damage was really caused by
an “intervening act” that breaks the chain of causal connection” between
the actions of the accused and the damage that occurred.<a href="#fn339"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339" role="doc-noteref"><sup>339</sup></a>
The idea is that the intervening act is the true cause of the harm
caused. But this is the case only if the event is superseding cause—that
is, an <em>unforeseeable</em> intervening cause. In other words, an
intervening force only breaks the chain of causal connection when it is
<em>unforeseeable</em>. As the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts</em>
provides, “The intervention of a force which is a normal consequence of
a situation created by the actor’s … conduct is not a superseding cause
of harm which such conduct has been a substantial factor in bringing
about.” <a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>340</sup></a></p>
<p>But it is simply not the case that when an actor (whom we may in
general refer to as a “boss” or “inciter”) induces another human to
aggress against a victim, that the act of aggression is “unforeseeable”
merely because the intermediary has free will.<a href="#fn341"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341" role="doc-noteref"><sup>341</sup></a>
When a terrorist uses a courier to deliver a letter bomb, it is not
unforeseeable that the victim will receive it; and it is not
unforeseeable that the victim will open it. If I hire a hit-man to kill
someone, I am doing so because I hope and expect the victim to be
killed. If I send my underling to rob a bank, I am doing it to have the
bank robbed. If a woman persuades her lover to murder her husband, and
he does, she gets the result she wanted; can we really say the outcome
was “unforeseeable”?<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>342</sup></a> Thus, the fact that there are
other humans with free will who are part of the chain of events does not
excuse the instigator. This is, admittedly, how the positive law
reasons, but I think this is reasonable and compatible with
libertarian-based principles of rights, causation, and
responsibility.</p>
<p>We submit that the case of an intentional border-crossing being
carried out in part through human actors as opposed to through
exclusively inanimate or nonhuman means poses no special praxeological
problems. Whether the terrorist handed the bomb to his victim directly
or through an innocent third party, the legal analysis remains the same.
We look to see who intentionally employed means to cause an unwanted
invasion against another. The means can be nonhuman or inanimate means,
or another human, whether innocent or acting in coordination with the
actor. In this case, the (innocent) courier was the terrorist’s
<em>means</em> of killing the victim. It is simply confused to claim, as
some do, that the terrorist in this case is not a cause of the killing
because the chain of causation is “broken” by the “intervening” acts of
another human (the courier) with free will. The acts of the courier do
not <em>absolve</em> the terrorist; to the contrary, they
<em>implicate</em> him, since he used the courier and his actions to
cause damage to the victim.</p>
<p>In the cases mentioned above, only innocent parties—the courier, or
the victim himself—are employed as the malfeasor’s means of committing
aggression. Although here we find the terrorist alone responsible for
the killing, it will not always be the case that an act of aggression
“belongs” to just one person. For example, consider a bank heist in
which there are several participants. One of them drives the getaway
car; another handles crowd control; a third directs the action by
walkie-talkie; and a fourth actually steals the money. The one who takes
by force money that does not belong to him is clearly guilty of robbery.
But most libertarians would agree that his companions are no less
guilty. Most libertarians would recognize this as a “simultaneous”
criminal conspiracy that renders all of its participants independently
and jointly responsible. And that is our conclusion as well. But how can
we justify that conclusion, inasmuch as only one person actually took
possession of the stolen money?</p>
<p>The key is causation. Each of these actors had the goal that the
bank’s and customers’ property be seized and each intentionally used
means—including one another—to attain this goal. In other words,
<em>each</em> bank robber that was part of the conspiracy was a cause of
the robbery. Each had intent to achieve, and employed means to attain,
the illicit end.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>343</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider the following example: <em>A</em> purchases a
remote-controlled tank. With the remote control he can steer the tank
and fire its cannon. He directs the tank to blow down the walls of a
neighbor’s house, destroying the house and killing the neighbor. No one
would deny that <em>A</em> is the cause of the killing and is guilty of
murder and trespass. However, after the rampage, a hatch opens in the
tank, and an evil midget jumps out. It turns out, you see, that the
midget could see on a screen which buttons were pressed on the remote
control, and he would operate the tank accordingly. We submit that
<em>A</em> is equally liable in both cases. From his point of view, the
tank was a “black box” that he used to attain his end, regardless of
whether there was a human will somewhere in the chain of causation. No
one can plausibly argue that we cannot determine <em>A</em>’s liability
until we know whether there was a midget, or mere machinery, in the
tank. (Of course, the evil midget, if there is one, is also liable.)<a
href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>344</sup></a> In general, one can be liable for
acts commited by another, if one is employing them as means to commit
aggression. As Frank van Dun argues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, and their likes were not
innocent practitioners of free speech at a time when a lot of their
compatriots were blowing up towns and villages and people. The general
who, in his search of scapegoats for a defeat, sends a handful of
privates to the firing-squad is not exonerated by the fact that some
other privates actually fired the shots that killed their convicted
colleagues.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>345</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the simple fact that a person’s actions are mediated
through other persons does not mean he should not be held liable for
them. The driver of the getaway car is responsible for the robbery
because he is intentionally engaged in a “simultaneous” criminal
conspiracy to commit the heist. The mob boss who orders a crime is
liable for his underling’s actions. The political leader who orders
military actions is responsible for them. People can
conspire—collaborate, cooperate—to commit crimes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the conspiracy or joint action need not even be
simultaneous. In the terrorist example, the bomb did not detonate until
long after the terrorist had handed it over to the courier.
Nevertheless, he used the courier as an unwitting “partner” in a
temporal “conspiracy” to kill the intended victim. In situations such as
these, other human actors (including the victim) can be means to an end.
It should be emphasized, of course, that this is a general rule; the
analysis in each situation must be case-specific and take relevant facts
and context into account. Whether a given person is considered to be
“in” or “out” of the conspiracy—an intentional actor or an unwitting
dupe—will depend on the circumstances surrounding the particular
case.</p>
<p>Generally, however, the libertarian position is that what is
impermissible—and properly punishable—is <em>action that is
aggression</em>. This means action characterized by the following
structure: the actor intentionally employs some means (which can be mere
objects but could also include other actors, whether innocent or not)
calculated to cause an invasion of the physical borders of a
nonaggressor’s person or property.</p>
<h4 id="libertarian-objections">LIBERTARIAN OBJECTIONS</h4>
<p>Virtually no one has a quarrel with the notion that an actor is the
“cause” of a result if he employs nonhuman means to attain this result.
However, as indicated above, some, including some libertarians, assume
that if another <em>person</em> is employed as the means, somehow the
“chain” of causation is “broken.” For example, <em>A</em> somehow
persuades <em>C</em> to plant a bomb under <em>B</em>’s car, which kills
<em>B</em>. Some libertarians maintain that, while <em>C</em> is
responsible for <em>B</em>’s murder, <em>A</em> is not, because
<em>C</em>’s actions were undertaken with “free will,” thereby “breaking
the chain of causation.” They argue that what <em>C</em> did was commit
murder, while <em>A</em> committed a mere speech act, which does not in
and of itself aggress against anyone’s person or property. Similar
arguments are made for someone inciting a mob to lynch someone—“mere
incitement” is not, according to this view, and never can be, a crime.
You are not responsible for what a mob does, even if they act on your
instructions, since its members have free will.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, Walter Block’s approach to these issues.<a
href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>346</sup></a> Block follows Rothbard in
maintaining <em>categorically</em> that “inciting” others to commit a
crime (such as a riot) is simply not a crime. Rather, as Rothbard
maintains, “‘Inciting to riot’ … is a pure exercise of a man’s right to
speak without being thereby implicated in a crime.”<a href="#fn347"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347" role="doc-noteref"><sup>347</sup></a>
Block points out that the rioters have “free will”<a href="#fn348"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>348</sup></a>—unlike an inanimate object such as
a bullet—and therefore the inciter is not responsible for the riot. This
reasoning can be extended to absolve various mob bosses, political
leaders, and the like, who merely instruct underlings or intermediaries
to engage in aggressive acts. Hence the libertarian joke that Hitler’s
defense to war crimes would be, “I just gave orders.”<a href="#fn349"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>349</sup></a></p>
<p>Rothbard and Block are assuming here that the rioter <em>cannot</em>
be the means of the inciter, <em>because the rioter has free will</em>;
they assume that having another human in the chain of causation breaks
the chain. But as explained above, there is no reason other humans
cannot serve as means for one’s action.</p>
<h4 id="ad-hoc-exceptions"><em>Ad Hoc</em> Exceptions</h4>
<p>Understandably, libertarians who advance such views are uncomfortable
with the implications—with the idea that presidents and political
leaders, mob bosses, people who hire hit men, and so on, are not liable.
To avoid these difficulties, they advance various <em>ad hoc</em>
exceptions to their “incitement is never a crime, it’s just free speech”
or “the free will of the intermediary breaks the chain of causation”
arguments.<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>350</sup></a> Walter Block, for example, argues
that the “instigator” of actions<br />
directly committed by an intermediary can be liable if (a) he threatens
or coerces the intermediary to commit the crime,<a href="#fn351"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351" role="doc-noteref"><sup>351</sup></a>
(b) he contractually pays the intermediary money to commit the crime,<a
href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>352</sup></a> (c) he “orders” the intermediary
to commit the crime,<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>353</sup></a> or (d) he is “in” a “criminal
conspiracy with” the other person, whatever that means.<a href="#fn354"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354" role="doc-noteref"><sup>354</sup></a>
So if you coerce someone, or pay them, or “order” them, or “conspire
with” them, you are liable for the intermediary’s crimes. With so many
exceptions to the rule that one is simply not responsible for the
actions of others, the rule itself is questionable. Moreover, there is
no clear reason given for any of these exceptions; they are all
apparently supposed to be intuitively obvious cases, but there is no
unifying theme between them. These exceptions are <em>ad hoc</em> and
not based on any general theory.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref355" role="doc-noteref"><sup>355</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, if an instigator is usually off the hook for actions
committed by an intermediary, because the intermediary has free will,
why does coercion or monetary payment make a difference? If you coerce
someone, or pay him, he still has free will. Whether the instigator
threatens, or merely persuades, the intermediary, he still does not
“determine” the intermediary’s actions, since in both cases, he has free
will.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>356</sup></a> In fact, legal systems do not
absolve someone from liability for crime just because they are coerced,
in recognition of the fact that even coerced agents have choice and
culpability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, why is contractual, <em>monetary</em> payment some
special exception? What about other types of contract, such as a
contract for services, or other forms of inducement, such as the promise
of sex or getting in the instigator’s good graces? We cannot understand
why paying someone to murder a victim makes the payer responsible, while
there is categorically no responsibility for inducing or persuading
someone to commit the murder. Focusing on monetary payment as a special
exception seems contrary to the Rothbardian view of contracts as mere
title transfers (in which money is just one type of thing that can
contractually be transferred), and also contrary to the Austrian view of
the subjective nature of value (because people can be motivated by
things other than title transfers; the end of action need not be
obtaining ownership of something).</p>
<p>As for the former point: a contract is simply alienation to property:
it is simply a property title transfer. It is not a “binding
obligation.”<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>357</sup></a> Yet Block does seem to rely on the
conventional view of contracts as “binding obligations” or promises,
instead of as mere transfers of title to alienable owned resources
(Rothbard’s view, which Block elsewhere seems to support), to support
his <em>ad hoc</em> “incitement-by-monetary-payment” exception. As he
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, if Van Dun <em>paid</em> me for this information, e.g., the
hikers <em>paid and therefore contractually obligated</em> the local
yokel to tell the truth, then we would have entirely a different matter.
Then he would be guilty of a contract violation that resulted in death,
a very serious matter indeed.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>358</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Block’s use of the language “contractually obligated” indicates he is
not here viewing a contract as a mere transfer of ownership of a
resource, but rather as some kind of promise giving rise to a
legally-enforceable or binding obligation—contrary to the Rothbard-Evers
title-transfer theory of contract.</p>
<p>As for the latter point: paying someone is simply one means of
inducing them to do something—to obtain money that they subjectively
value. They could be induced or persuaded by giving them other things
they value, such as gratitude, or a service. Whether a woman pays a
hitman money to kill her husband or persuades him to do so for sexual
favors should not make a difference. To focus on the payment of money,
or coercion, as exceptions, is simply <em>ad hoc</em> and also ignores
the Rothbardian view of contracts, as well as the Austrian view of the
subjective nature of value.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref359" role="doc-noteref"><sup>359</sup></a></p>
<p>As for Block’s view that an instigator can be liable for the
intermediaries actions if he “orders” him, it is not clear what the
rationale is, although Block’s comments suggest he means here an order
coupled with a threat, in which case this exception collapses into the
first.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>360</sup></a> Why can’t the person who incites
the mob be characterized as “ordering” them to lynch someone, if
ordering does not require threats? If ordering does not require threats,
then why would this reasoning not apply to an inciter?</p>
<p>As for the final exception—liability in the case of being part of a
criminal conspiracy—there is no definition provided and no clear
explanation of why this makes one culpable.<a href="#fn361"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>361</sup></a>
No reason is given as to why we can’t characterize the person inciting a
lynch mob as being part of a criminal conspiracy with the lynchers.</p>
<p>As noted above with the Hitler example, even with these exceptions,
many “instigators” would not technically be culpable for actions taken
by their subordinates.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref362" role="doc-noteref"><sup>362</sup></a> Block attempts to
find a way out of absolving a Hitler or other political leader, or mob
boss, army general, and the like from liability for actions of their
subordinates by simply assuming or positing that they are always,
necessarily, threatening their subordinates, so that the first exception
applies. As he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he libertarian legal code proscribes not only invasive acts, but
also intimidation. Hitler, Stalin, et al. were not merely engaging in
their free speech rights. Rather, they were issuing orders to their
subordinates to maim and kill innocent people. Implicit in these
commands was the threat that if they were not obeyed, those who failed
to carry out these orders would be summarily dealt with.<a href="#fn363"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>363</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is simply a convenient, yet false, assumption. First, not
every underling is literally threatened with physical punishment if he
does not obey orders. Second, even if the underling is threatened, the
threat does not necessarily come <em>from the boss</em>, but rather from
others in the hierarchy or organization. Did Hitler <em>literally</em>,
personally threaten any of his generals or subordinates
<em>himself</em>? Did President Truman threaten his generals or,
indirectly, the airmen who dropped nuclear bombs on Japan? Simply
assuming every leader or boss is necessarily “threatening” the
underlings is unrealistic and just too convenient of an assumption to
let one wriggle out of the uncomfortable consequences of this <em>ad
hoc</em> theorizing. (And, again, even when the underling is threatened,
this <em>still</em> does not mean his actions were “determined”; he
still has the same free will that a non-coerced intermediary has.) We
would argue that the leaders in these social or institutional
hierarchies are responsible for the crimes committed by subordinates,
even if they don’t threaten them.</p>
<p>In sum, it is a mistake to conclude that someone can be responsible
for the actions of others <em>only</em> in the cases of the exceptions
of coercion, monetary payment, orders + threats, or criminal conspiracy.
It makes more sense to scrutinize actions in terms of the more
generalizable praxeological means-end framework set forth above. This
framework easily justifies all the “exceptions” noted above, and more.
In each case, the malfeasor (wrongdoer) had a prohibited end in mind
(some type of property invasion), and employs means that attain this
end. The fact that the means in these examples were other people simply
does not prevent the action from being classified as aggression.</p>
<h4
id="fixed-pie-of-responsibility-and-joint-and-several-liability"><em>Fixed
Pie of Responsibility and Joint and Several Liability</em></h4>
<p>The reluctance to attribute responsibility to the instigator of a
crime, unless one of the exceptions is met, may be due to confusion
about the nature of responsibility for torts or crimes. First, as noted
above, some believe that the intermediary or underling’s free will
breaks the chain of causation so that the instigator is not liable. But
since cooperative action (for good or evil) is possible, and humans can
employ other humans as means to accomplish ends, this is not a tenable
objection.</p>
<p>In addition, some libertarians seem to believe that holding the
instigator or inciter liable would relieve the underling or henchman of
responsibility, which they understandably oppose. We may refer to this
as the “fixed pie of responsibility” fallacy. For example, libertarian
author Jack Lloyd seems to implicitly adopt such reasoning; note the use
of the word “rather” here: “In this Steel-Man-case scenario, Hitler
would not be culpable for an initiation of force. <em>Rather</em>, the
people who did the actual initiations and threats of force would be
culpable….”<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>364</sup></a> The word “rather” implies it has
to be <em>either</em> Hitler, <em>or</em> his underlings, that is
responsible. But why can’t it be both?</p>
<p>Block also seems to implicitly accept such an approach. He
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Dun tries to make an analogy between the triggerman and the
bullet, on the one hand, and the inciter and the rioter, on the other.
He argues that the gunman is really responsible for the murder, not the
bullet that actually kills, because the former came first in the causal
chain, and so was responsible for the effect of the latter. This
conclusion is true enough. But then he maintains that precisely the same
relationship obtains between the inciter and the rioter who murders. To
do so, however, he would have to say that, after all, the inciter, too,
is responsible for the murder, not the rioter who actually kills,
because the former came first in the causal chain, and was thus
responsible for the effect of the latter.</p>
<p>When put in this way, the problems with the analogy are apparent.
First, no one in his right mind would hold the bullet guilty of
anything. It is an inanimate object, for all of its destructive power.
Yet, it would be the rare analyst, even one as intent upon incarcerating
the <em>inciter</em> as is Van Dun, who would allow the <em>rioter</em>
off scot-free, as he would the bullet. That is, no one would even think
to “punish” the bullet for its evil deed.<a href="#fn365"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>365</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the language “he would have to say that, after all, the inciter,
too, is responsible for the murder, <em>not the rioter who actually
kills</em>” (emphasis added) and the criticism that by holding the
inciter responsible, the rioter would have to be let off “scot-free.”
But there is no basis for this contention. Just because the inciter or
instigator is culpable does <em>not</em> mean the rioter or underling is
off the hook. It is perfectly possible to hold them <em>both</em> fully
liable; this is what joint and several liability means.<a href="#fn366"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>366</sup></a></p>
<p>With this “fixed pie of liability” assumption, some might object that
each malfeasor is responsible only for his pro-rata “part” of the crime.
Maybe the instigator is 60% responsible and the underling 40%
responsible. And so on. These critics mistakenly assume that there is
some fixed 100 percent bucket of liability for a crime, which cannot be
shared jointly by multiple parties. They thus are leery of attributing
some responsibility to the boss because they think that this would
reduce the liability of the underling. But there is no conceptual
problem with having multiple parties <em>each fully liable</em> for the
same act of aggression, under the notion of joint and several liability.
It is not clear why my opponents here do not realize that this doctrine
can play a useful role as part of the analysis of collective action. As
an example, suppose <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> jointly borrow money from
<em>C</em>. If <em>A</em> is unable to pay his share later, it is not as
if <em>C</em> can only pursue <em>B</em> for half the amount owed; he
can pursue each debtor for 100% of the amount owed (barring contractual
terms to the contrary).<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref367" role="doc-noteref"><sup>367</sup></a></p>
<p>Likewise, just as one criminal can harm multiple victims and be
unable to be punished by, or render full restitution to, each victim—so
multiple criminals can each be fully—jointly and severally—liable for
the damage done to the victim. There is simply no reason to maintain
that there is a finite “pie” of “criminal harm” that has to be
distributed piecemeal to multiple criminals who collaborate to harm
someone. It is the victim’s rights that matter most, not that of
individual criminals.<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>368</sup></a> Suppose two criminals cooperate to
rob someone of $10,000 worth of property and then they spend the money.
Suppose they are later apprehended; the first is penniless and the
second has assets. The second should be forced to pay the victim the
full $10,000 owed,<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>369</sup></a> not only half on the grounds that
his partner owes the other $5,000 to the victim. Why should the victim,
as opposed to the bankrupt criminal’s partner in crime, be left holding
the bag? Thus it is just to hold both the mob boss, and his henchman,
fully liable and responsible for a murder committed by the henchman but
ordered by the boss.</p>
<h4 id="mere-speech-and-causation"><em>“Mere” Speech and
Causation</em></h4>
<p>Related to the above-noted arguments is the notion that “mere” speech
cannot be aggression since it does not actually invade others’ property
borders. It is true that a speech act <em>per se</em> is not an act of
aggression: it does not intentionally cause the person or property of
another to be physically and nonconsensually infringed upon.<a
href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>370</sup></a> (Shooting a gun, or swinging your
first, is also not <em>per se</em> an act of aggression!) But some
speech acts can be classified as acts of aggression in the context in
which they occur because they constitute the speaker’s use of means
calculated to inflict intentional harm, and because of the social and
institutional hierarchies involved. One clear example of this is threats
of force. The threat to stab someone does not actually pierce the
victim’s skin; it is a “mere” speech-act, but it is still regarded as
aggression. Offering to pay money to someone to assassinate someone
would be another example. But these are not mere <em>ad hoc</em>
exceptions; they are the result of the application of the more general
means-end analysis.<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>371</sup></a></p>
<p>In other cases, the act of speaking—communicating—and the other
people with whom the speaker communicates serve as one’s means to
achieve a certain end. The firing squad commander who yells “Fire!” is
as responsible for the ensuing execution as the riflemen themselves.<a
href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>372</sup></a> This is not because his spoken
word was physically the cause of the victim’s death. His voice did not
propel the bullets forward—and it did not have to. Instead, the firing
squad commander is responsible for the execution because of what the
command “Fire!” <em>signifies</em> in the context and social hierarchy
in which it was uttered; it signifies that the commander intends for the
victim to die and is choosing to employ efficacious means—his firing
squad—calculated to achieve that goal. The firing squad commander isn’t
“merely” speaking; he is intentionally colluding with the shooters for
the purpose of killing the victim. Likewise the American president who
orders a bomb be dropped is causing the bombing; he is employing the
pilot and other underlings as his means. By being part of a certain
organization or hierarchy and having certain relationships with other
people, as a practical matter he is in a position to use other people to
achieve his ends.<a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref373"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>373</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider the car-bomb scenario discussed above. When <em>A</em>
persuades <em>C</em> to plant the bomb, his words do not physically
cause <em>B</em>’s car to explode. And they do not even physically cause
<em>C</em> to plant the bomb—<em>C</em> voluntarily chooses to do so.
The fact that <em>C</em>’s action was voluntary, however, does not mean
that <em>A</em>’s action—persuading someone to plant a car-bomb—cannot
itself be considered aggression. To the contrary, <em>A</em> is an
aggressor because his actions demonstrated the intent to kill <em>B</em>
and the use of means calculated to do just that. So what if his chosen
means included another person and his intervening will?</p>
<p>Let us return to the incitement example. In order to determine
whether the inciter is responsible, we ask whether the inciter <em>used
the mob as his means</em> to attain the violent acts committed by the
rioting mob. For the inciter’s action to be considered aggression, he
would have to <em>intend</em> the prohibited result; and he would have
to have <em>chosen means</em> that resulted in the rioting. We do not
maintain that the inciter is necessarily responsible in every case; the
question turns on many specific facts and the context. What we maintain
is that the inciter is not off the hook <em>merely because</em> the
rioters had free will. The question to be answered is: was the mob the
<em>means</em> of the inciter? Was the inciter a cause of the mob
rioting, or of their ensuing havoc?</p>
<p>As Van Dun keenly observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who should take credit for the poem: the blind poet, or his
girlfriend who lovingly typed the manuscript (which she could have
refused to do)? And if the blind poet really is the author of the poem,
why should the rabble-rousing demagogue not be the author of the riots
he incites?</p>
<p>Why should we require libertarian judges to turn a blind eye to real
processes of “social causation” when we know that advertisers,
educators, politicians, and agitators are very much aware of them—and
willing to use them for their purposes? It is not just in a libertarian
world that each person is responsible for his own acts; it is true in
every world. However, we should not take that as an excuse for
disregarding the complex causal processes that go on in the real world,
whatever legal code is in force. A libertarian judge has to confront the
facts. Reality does not yield to theory. It is all right for a judge to
remind a man charged with participating in a violent mob that he is
responsible for his own actions, but only after he has determined what
the man’s own <em>actions</em>—not merely his bodily movements—really
were. If the man was forced (coerced, compelled) by another to
participate, we have one sort of case. If he got paid to smash windows,
we have another sort of case. If he was manipulated in any other way,
surely we cannot just pretend that then everything was the same as if he
was not manipulated in any way—and treat the manipulator as if he was
just an innocent bystander.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref374" role="doc-noteref"><sup>374</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same question is asked in a variety of situations: did the
general kill people, using his troops as means to this end? Did the
manager use his employee as a means to attain some end? Did the wife
kill her husband by using her lover (or a hired hit-man) as the means to
attain this goal? If someone votes in favor of socialism (or speaks out
in favor of it), are they a cause of the ensuing acts of aggression by
state agents? If a witness lies on the witness stand, resulting in a
criminal defendant wrongly being imprisoned, has he caused harm to the
defendant, through means of jurors, jailers, and the judicial system?<a
href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>375</sup></a> In other words, was the first
party a <em>cause</em> of the result that was actually committed by an
intermediate person?</p>
<p>Although there will be easy cases, we do not suggest that merely
formulating the issue in this manner makes the correct answer easy to
find in every situation. Such questions must take into account relevant
facts and the context, custom, social hierarchies and realities, and
depend on the sense of justice of the judge or jury—of the community.
Looking at actions from the praxeological point of view, however, helps
us look in the right place and ask the right questions. No doubt, in
cases where the intermediate actor is coerced, or paid, by the first
party, it is easier to see that the first party is the cause of the
threatened or remunerated action.<a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref376" role="doc-noteref"><sup>376</sup></a> But it is simply
arbitrary to restrict cause to cases where the intermediate actor is
threatened, or paid cash.</p>
<h4 id="cause-in-fact-proximate-cause-and-action">CAUSE-IN-FACT,
PROXIMATE CAUSE, AND ACTION</h4>
<p>Before turning to Reinach’s views on causation, a brief discussion of
the contrast between conventional legal theories and that laid out here
is in order. In general, in the common law, to be responsible, an actor
needs to be both the cause-in-fact (or “but-for” cause) of a prohibited
result, and also the “proximate” (or “legal”) cause (referred to as
“culpability” in continental legal systems).<a href="#fn377"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377" role="doc-noteref"><sup>377</sup></a>
Both need to be satisfied. One is a cause-in-fact of a result if “but
for” the person’s actions, the result would not have occurred. There are
various tests for proximate cause, but basically the idea is that the
results had to be intended, or somewhat foreseeable to the actor, and
not too “remote” (hence “proximate,” meaning near or close) from the
person’s action. It is sometimes said that the result had to follow as a
natural, direct, and immediate consequence of the action, with no
“intervening cause” breaking the connection between the action and the
result. For example, a murderer’s mother is a cause-in-fact of the
murders he commits, for without her actions (giving birth to him) the
murders would not have been committed. Yet she is not a proximate cause
of the murders and therefore not responsible.</p>
<p>In our case, when we ask if someone was the cause of a certain
aggression, we are asking whether the actor did choose and employ means
to attain the prohibited result. For there to be “cause” in this sense,
obviously there has to be cause-in-fact or “but-for” causation—this is
implied by the notion of the means employed “attaining” or resulting in
the actor’s end. Intentionality is also a factor, because action has to
be intentional to be an action (the means is chosen and employed
intentionally; the actor intends to achieve a given end).<a
href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>378</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="reinach-and-causation">REINACH AND CAUSATION</h4>
<p>Reinach provides a framework for the analysis of legal causation
which, although it employs different terminology, is largely compatible
with the Austrian-praxeological view presented above.<a href="#fn379"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>379</sup></a>
Reinach states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every action which is a condition for an outcome is, in relation to
the intentional crime, a cause of this outcome in the sense of the
criminal law. … Disregarding exceptional cases of the law, the
characterized principle is fully valid. It is then also to be said: if
the action is a sound [<em>zurechnungsfähigen</em>] condition of an
unlawful outcome, and if an intention is also given in relation to this
outcome, then the agent is customarily punished. … That an outcome is
brought about means that it is brought about by an action which sets a
condition for the outcome; to bring about intentionally means to bring
about via an action that sets a condition. The latter condition brings
about the outcome. Intention is a striving for an outcome via an action,
or mediated by an action. This outcome itself can of course be a means
to another outcome. The death of a human being can be striven for in
order to obtain the things left behind which the murderer subsequently
is entitled to. But the outcome is “striven” for, also when it is not a
final goal, but in that case is “striven” for as a means towards a final
goal. There are however several kinds of strivings: one can hope for,
desire [<em>ersehnen</em>], or fear for [<em>befürchten</em>] a result.
These are all “strivings” for a result, but not a striving in our sense.
It is a striving “in relation to that to which it is applied”; for us it
is a matter of striving for an outcome with the awareness that something
can be contributed [such as to control] to its occurrence. Such a
striving is called an act of will [<em>Wollen</em>]. To cause something
intentionally means to set a condition for an outcome through a
voluntary action such that this condition of course in combination with
other conditions brings about the outcome…. Intention is to will an
outcome.<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>380</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This analysis is strikingly compatible with the Austrian
understanding of action. Reinach’s use of “cause” and “condition” is
similar to the proximate cause and “cause-in-fact” test discussed above.
Reinach maintains that an action that intends the outcome to occur
(i.e., desires a given end or goal), and “causes” this outcome to occur
by an action (i.e., employs a means to attain this goal), then the actor
should be punished for the action, which is a crime.</p>
<p>Using Reinach’s causal analysis, one would, as in the analysis
presented above, not necessarily absolve someone of responsibility
simply because another human is used to help “cause” the unlawful end.
Reinach’s paper is full of interesting and illuminating examples and
applications of causation framework. In one colorful example, <em>A</em>
sends <em>B</em> into a forest in the hopes that he will be struck by
lightning.<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>381</sup></a> Reinach contrasts this case with
one in which <em>A</em> is able to calculate precisely where and when a
tree will be struck by lightning, and, with malicious intent, sends
<em>B</em> to be at the fateful place where lightning strikes. In both
cases, Reinach argues, <em>A</em> is the “cause” (our “cause-in-fact”)
of <em>B</em>’s death, since <em>B</em>’s death would not have occurred
but for <em>A</em>’s having sent him into the forest. Nevertheless,
Reinach concludes that <em>A</em> may be punished only in the second
case and not in the first. The difference hinges upon <em>A</em>’s
intent. In the first case, <em>A</em> hoped for <em>B</em> to die, but
it was simply wishful thinking: he had no control over the lightning,
and no knowledge of any objective likelihood that it would strike where
it did.</p>
<p>In praxeological terms, <em>A</em>’s action in the first case cannot
be construed as “killing” <em>B</em>, because he did not really intend
<em>B</em> to die and did not employ any means expected to attain such a
goal, any more than a rain dance causes it to rain or sticking pins in a
voodoo doll harms the “victim.” <em>A</em>’s action is not calculated to
cause harm to <em>B</em>; in fact, <em>A</em> does not expect and has no
reason to expect that <em>B</em> will die as a result of going into the
forest. As Reinach puts it, “the intention fails if the outcome is only
hoped for, but the intention is present if it is expected with
certainty.”<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>382</sup></a> Thus the praxeological view and
Reinach’s framework are consistent in this case.</p>
<p>In the second case, <em>A</em> has more than an empty wish: he has
certain knowledge that sending <em>B</em> into the forest will result in
<em>B</em>’s being struck by lightning. Here Reinach finds <em>A</em> to
have the intent necessary to be held responsible for <em>B</em>’s death.
Likewise, praxeologically, <em>A</em>’s action now becomes more than
simply “dispatching <em>B</em> into the forest.” With the knowledge that
sending <em>B</em> into the forest will cause his death, <em>A</em>’s
action rises to the level of “intentionally killing <em>B</em>.” This is
because, if <em>A</em> knows for certain that sending <em>B</em> into
the forest will result in <em>B</em>’s death by lightning, then
<em>A</em> has the requisite intent to attain the goal of <em>B</em>’s
death, and his action employs means (namely, sending <em>B</em> into the
forest) that do attain this goal.</p>
<p>This example can be a useful tool for separating criminal aggressors
from their noncriminal sympathizers. Earlier we pointed out that the
rule that allows one person to be responsible for another person’s
aggressive actions is a general one that must be applied cautiously and
on a case-by-case basis, taking context and circumstances into account.
The lightning example can help clarify our intuitions about which
actions are aggressive and which are not. It is aggression when one
person intentionally uses another as a means to cause an unwanted
property violation; it is not aggression when one person merely hopes
for a property violation to occur but does not intentionally use means
to accomplish it. The Israeli<br />
government, for example, recently assassinated Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>383</sup></a></p>
<p>Putting aside the question of whether Yassin was an innocent victim
or a deserving target, we can surely acknowledge that there are many
people—especially in the United States and Israel—who wanted to see
Yassin killed. But only a very small number of these people intended to
kill Yassin themselves or to assist his killers in any way. The lesson
of Reinach’s lightning example is that the people who simply hoped that
Yassin would die, or who rejoiced when he was killed, are not
responsible for his killing. They gave his killers silent support and
sympathy, but they did not intentionally act with the purpose of killing
him. The team of assassins themselves, and the Israeli government that
sponsored them, are responsible for the killing, but not the citizens
who opinion polls show approve of the assassination.</p>
<p>This result is compatible with the framework advocated herein. The
subtle insights, analysis, and examples provided in Reinach’s
century-old paper are clearly still useful in constructing a
praxeologically sound theory of legal causation today.<a href="#fn384"

<h4 id="i.-introduction-1">I. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<h5 id="a.-property-and-contract"><em>A. Property and Contract</em></h5>
<p>A system of property rights specifies how to determine which
individuals own—have the right to control—particular scarce resources.
By having a just, objective rule for allocating control of scare
resources to particular owners, resource use conflicts may be reduced.
Nonowners can simply refrain from invading the borders of the owned
resources—that is, avoid using the thing without the owner’s consent.<a
href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>385</sup></a> Using a property rights scheme, it
is at least possible for conflict to be avoided or reduced. This is the
very purpose and function of property rights: to respond to the
practical problem of conflict in a world of multiple actors.<a
href="#fn386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref386"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>386</sup></a></p>
<p>Under the libertarian approach, people are self-owners, that is, they
own their bodies. As for external resources, that is, previously-unowned
conflictable resources, the first to use an <em>unowned</em> scarce
resource—the homesteader—becomes its owner.<a href="#fn387"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387" role="doc-noteref"><sup>387</sup></a>
This is called original appropriation or, sometimes, usually in the case
of real (immovable) property, homesteading. The first possessor has
better title in the resource than any possible challenger, who is
always, with respect to him, a latecomer.<a href="#fn388"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>388</sup></a></p>
<p>But property rights are not only acquired; they may be lost or
transferred to others. For example, the owner may abandon the thing so
that it once more becomes unowned and available for appropriation by a
new homesteader. Likewise, the owner may give or sell the resource to
another. The owner might also commit a crime or tort, thereby forfeiting
his rights to the resource, in favor of the victim.<a href="#fn389"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref389"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>389</sup></a></p>
<p>Property theory concerns not only the initial acquisition of property
rights in conflictable resources, but also their loss and transfer. Tort
and punishment theory, as subsets of general property theory, describe
how acts of aggression or negligence change ownership rights to scarce
resources.<a href="#fn390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref390"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>390</sup></a> Contract theory specifies how
rights are transferred as the result of voluntary agreement between the
owner and others. While some voluntary agreements are said to be
“enforceable,” others are not. The question for libertarians concerns
when and why agreements are legally enforceable. In other words, how are
(property) rights voluntarily (consensually) transferred?</p>
<h5 id="b.-overview-of-contract"><em>B. Overview of Contract</em></h5>
<p>Contracts are used in exchange—from simple barter to complex
exchanges such as loans and employment contracts. In economics, exchange
has to do with the motivations of the actor and his view of opportunity
costs. In the positive law, in both the common law and civil law, a
contract is seen as a relation between two or more parties which
includes legally <em>enforceable obligations</em> between them.</p>
<p>Contracts result from <em>agreement</em> or <em>promises</em> between
the parties, e.g., one party promises to another to do (or not do)
something, or to give some (owned or ownable) thing to the other party.
The promise may be made in exchange for things given or promised by the
second party. The promises may be future-oriented and based on certain
conditions. Agreements may be simple or complex; contemporaneous or
future-oriented; unilateral donations or bilateral and reciprocal.</p>
<p>Not all agreements or promises result in a binding contract or
legally enforceable obligations. Only those meeting certain criteria
are, depending on the legal system.<a href="#fn391" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref391" role="doc-noteref"><sup>391</sup></a> For example, in the
common law, there must be <em>consideration</em>; in the civil law,
there must be <em>cause</em>. The parties must have capacity. And so on.
If the promises or agreement made results in a contract, the force of
law can be brought to bear to enforce the contract—the agreement may be
“enforced.” In modern legal systems, when one party breaches the
contract (fails to render the agreed-upon performance), the other party
may sue to have appropriate “remedies” awarded. The remedies usually
include an award of money, called damages.</p>
<p>Under the positive law, contractual obligations may be classified as
obligations <em>to do</em>, <em>not to do</em>, or <em>to give</em>.<a
href="#fn392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref392"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>392</sup></a> An obligation <em>to give</em> may
be viewed as a transfer of title to property, as it is an obligation to
give ownership of a thing to another. An obligation <em>to do</em> is an
obligation to perform a specific action, such as an obligation to sing
at a wedding or paint someone’s house. It is significant for our
purposes that courts usually will <em>not</em> order <em>specific
performance</em> (forcing the breaching or unwilling party to perform
the contract), on the grounds that the plaintiff can usually be
adequately compensated with money damages.<a href="#fn393"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref393" role="doc-noteref"><sup>393</sup></a>
Further, money damages do not impose a heavy burden on the court to
supervise performance, while specific performance would. Specific
performance would often be counterproductive. Consider a singer who
refuses to perform a promised contract, for example. If ordered to
perform, the singer might well give a shabby performance. For these and
other reasons, in such cases, the singer would be ordered to pay
monetary damages to the other party instead of ordered to sing.</p>
<p>Even an agreement to sell a piece of property, such as a barrel of
apples or a car, will usually not be enforced with specific performance;
instead, the court would order the promisor (obligor) to pay the
promisee (obligee) a sum of money.</p>
<p>So-called “specific performance” is typically granted only in the
case of unique property, such as a particular portrait, or in the case
of real estate, because each parcel of land is unique. But note that,
even in this case, specific performance results in the transfer of title
to the unique property from the owner to the other party, which supports
the Rothbard-Evers title-transfer theory of contract advocated
below.</p>
<p>Thus, in modern positive law, “breach of contract”—failing to render
the contractual obligations—results in a transfer of property—sometimes
unique goods such as real property, but usually money—from the breaching
party to the promisee. Contracts are enforced today <em>not</em> by
forcing a party to perform the promised action but by threatening to
transfer some of the promisor’s owned resources to the promisee
<em>if</em> the promisor does not perform. For an agreement to be
enforceable under modern legal systems <em>means that</em> some of one
party’s owned resources (whether money or some other owned good, usually
a unique good such as land or a painting) can be forcibly transferred to
the other party.</p>
<p>What this means is that, in reality, in modern contract law, there
are really no contractual obligations “to do” anything. It also means
contract breach is really impossible, as contracts are not enforceable
obligations to do things. There are only obligations to transfer title
to resources, either directly (agreement to pay a sum of money) or as a
consequence of failure to perform a promised action (a conditional
obligation to pay a sum of money if the promised performance does not
occur).</p>
<p>It should be noted that, despite the lack of a legal compulsion to
perform a contract, the institution of contract is alive and well. The
legal threat of transfer of some of the promisor’s resources (commonly
called “property”) in the event of default, combined with reputation
effects, is apparently sufficient to render contracting a useful
institution.</p>
<p>At a minimum, contract theory purports to justify the transfer of
title to the property of parties to a contract. And in the case of
specific performance, debtors’ prison, and voluntary slavery, contract
theory must justify the use of force against the parties. Not
surprisingly, then, a variety of arguments have been set forth
attempting to explain why agreements may be enforced.<a href="#fn394"

<h5 id="c.-speech-promises-and-libertarianism"><em>C. Speech, Promises,
and Libertarianism</em></h5>
<p>The question especially interests libertarians. By endorsing a given
theory of contract, we are, in effect, supporting the transfer of
property rights from the owner to others, in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Why does making a promise or agreeing or “committing” to do something
result in a transfer of rights from the promisor to the promisee? To
many—even to many libertarians—it seems to be elementary and obvious: if
you promise to do something, you may be forced to do it. Some
libertarians and laymen assume that an individual has some power or
ability to legally “bind” or obligate himself by simply promising to do
something. However, this assumption is groundless. Not all promises are
enforceable, nor should they be.</p>
<p>As a general matter, libertarians hold that the use of force is
permissible only in <em>response</em> to <em>initiated</em> force. Or,
more generally, an owner of a resource is entitled to use force to
defend his ownership rights in his body and in resources he or she owns.
Ownership of an external resource means that the owner can withhold
consent (exclude) others or invite them to use the resource.</p>
<p>In other words, viewed in property terms, a resource may be used only
with the <em>consent</em> of its owner. Unprovoked aggression against
another is a use of his resource (or his body) without his consent and
is therefore prohibited. As a result of the act of aggression, the
victim becomes entitled to use the aggressor’s property (or body) for,
e.g., purposes of punishment. That is, by committing aggression—using a
victim’s property without consent—some or all of the aggressor’s
property rights are transferred to the victim. Because the aggressor
used the victim’s property as if it were his own (although it is not),
the victim may use the aggressor’s property as if it is his own.<a
href="#fn395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref395"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>395</sup></a> This is why initiated force
(aggression) is impermissible, while responsive force—force in response
to aggression—is not.</p>
<p>It is impermissible to use force in response to <em>non</em>-invasive
actions, since this would be itself initiated force. Speech is
(generally) non-aggressive, for example, because it does not invade
others’ property borders, so it does not justify the use of responsive
force.<a href="#fn396" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref396"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>396</sup></a> Libertarians oppose censorship and
recognize a free-speech right because speech, <em>per se</em>, does not
aggress (usually). The recipient of noxious or unwanted speech is free
to ignore it and go about his business. The boundaries of his body and
property are not invaded by speech, and his actions are not physically
restrained by the mere words of others.</p>
<p>The same holds true of promises, at least at first glance. As even
mainstream contract theorists have pointed out, a “mere promise” is not
sufficient to create a binding contractual obligation.<a href="#fn397"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref397"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>397</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, consider a budding singer who asks his famous actor
friend to attend the singer’s concert. The famous actor says, “I’ll be
there.” The singer is pleased, hoping that the actor’s fame will add
publicity to the event. To the singer’s disappointment, though, the
actor fails to show up. Did the actor violate any of the singer’s
rights? Of course not. What if the actor had said, “I promise to attend
your concert”? The actor told, or promised, the singer that he would go
to the concert, but he did not by these speech-acts aggress against the
singer or his property.</p>
<p>A promise, then, would seem to be unenforceable unless it somehow
gives rise to or involves an act of aggression, that is, it somehow
causes an uninvited use—invasion of the borders—of another’s property.
But a promise seems to be merely a speech-act; it does not appear to
aggress against anyone.</p>
<p>If promises are not aggression, then the only other way that promises
could be enforceable is if the promise resulted in a transfer of
property rights from the promisor to the promisee. Then the promisee
could “enforce” the contract by simply using the (former) property of
the promisor, title to which has transferred to the promisee.</p>
<p>However, to state that promises transfer property title begs the
question that contract theory asks: Why does a promise serve to transfer
title?</p>
<h5 id="d.-consideration"><em>D. Consideration</em></h5>
<p>Many theories have been set forth in an attempt to explain or justify
why the law enforces contracts, and why it makes some promises “binding”
or enforceable. It is only a special type of promise, or a promise plus
<em>something else</em>, that results in a legally binding contract
under today’s legal systems.</p>
<p>Under the common-law doctrine of bargained-for consideration, (an
enforceable) contract requires a promise and
<em>consideration</em>—something of value received in exchange for the
promise.<a href="#fn398" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref398"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>398</sup></a> This is why a dollar, or ten
dollars, is often given (or stated to be given) by one party who is
receiving something from another party. The consideration may be another
promise or something else of value. For example, in a bilateral
contract, the parties obligate themselves reciprocally so that each
one’s promised obligation serves as the consideration for the other’s
promise.<a href="#fn399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref399"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>399</sup></a> The value of the consideration
given need not match the value of the thing received. In fact, even
consideration as small as a “peppercorn” will suffice.<a href="#fn400"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref400"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>400</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet the antiquated doctrine of consideration has long been
criticized.<a href="#fn401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref401"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>401</sup></a> It would prevent a contract from
being formed in some situations that it seems they should be, such as
gratuitous (gift) promises and even some commercial promises.<a
href="#fn402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>402</sup></a> Further, if a mere promise (naked
promise, or <em>nudum pactum</em>) is not enforceable, why does it
become enforceable just because the promisee gives something small in
return? Given that only a token amount of consideration—a “mere
peppercorn”—is sufficient to make a promise enforceable, doesn’t the
doctrine of consideration elevate form over substance? Why can we not
dispense with the formality and make mere promises, or at least promises
with some kind of sufficient formality, enforceable? Further, under
Austrian value theory, how can we say the thing given in return “has a
value” to the recipient?<a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref403" role="doc-noteref"><sup>403</sup></a> Maybe he accepts it
only as a formality to satisfy the courts.</p>
<p>From the libertarian point of view, receiving consideration for a
promise does not turn the promise into an act of aggression, nor is it
clear how it causes the promise to effectuate a transfer of title any
better than a naked promise would.</p>
<h5 id="e.-promissory-estoppel-and-detrimental-reliance"><em>E.
Promissory Estoppel and Detrimental Reliance</em></h5>
<p>The requirement of consideration can sometimes lead to seemingly
harsh results, because some promises will be unenforceable if there is
no consideration, but they will be relied upon by the promisee. A
classic example is the grandfather who promises his granddaughter he
will pay her tuition if she goes to college. However, in exchange, she
gives nothing of legally recognized value, so there is no consideration
and, thus, no binding contract. Halfway through her college career, the
old man may change his mind and stop paying. What is the granddaughter
to do? Can she sue to enforce the promise to pay for her tuition? Under
the standard theory of contract, she cannot prevail, because
consideration is missing.</p>
<p>The equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel is used in common law
systems to form an alternative basis for enforcement of contracts.<a
href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>404</sup></a> This doctrine seeks to protect the
“expectations” or “reliance interest” of the promisee.<a href="#fn405"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405" role="doc-noteref"><sup>405</sup></a>
The <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</em>, for example,
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce
action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and
which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can
be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for
breach may be limited as justice requires.<a href="#fn406"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>406</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the Louisiana Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A party may be obligated by a promise when he knew or should have
known that the promise would induce the other party to rely on it to his
detriment and the other party was reasonable in so relying. Recovery may
be limited to the expenses incurred or the damages suffered as a result
of the promisee’s reliance on the promise.<a href="#fn407"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>407</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is “detrimental reliance,” promissory estoppel can be
invoked to enforce the promise. Even though there is technically not a
valid contract, because, for example, the promisee gave no
consideration, the promisor is “estopped” to deny this because this
would work a hardship on the promisee.<a href="#fn408"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408" role="doc-noteref"><sup>408</sup></a>
In the case of the granddaughter, she can prevail in court under this
theory. In this way, detrimental reliance is used as an alternative
ground for contract enforcement. The idea of protecting the expectations
or reliance interests of promisees is also sometimes seen as the primary
justification for enforcing contracts.</p>
<p>The theory of detrimental reliance rests on the notion that a promise
sets up an “expectation” of performance in the mind of the promisee
which induces him to act because he “reasonably relies” on this
expectation. But this is confused. Every time someone acts, he is
“relying” on some understanding of reality. This reliance might be quite
ridiculous or unreasonable. Thus, all detrimental reliance theories and
doctrines inevitably qualify the theory by saying that a promise is
enforceable only if the promisee <em>reasonably</em> or
<em>justifiably</em> relied on the promise.<a href="#fn409"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref409" role="doc-noteref"><sup>409</sup></a>
If the reliance is not reasonable, it is not really the promisor’s
“fault” that the promisee relied. The promisor could not have
anticipated outlandish reliance.</p>
<p>One major problem with this doctrine, however, is its circularity. In
deciding whether to rely on a given promise, a reasonable person would
take into account whether promises, in a given legal system, are
enforceable. If promises without consideration are known to be
unenforceable, for example, it would be unreasonable to rely on them
because it is known that the promisor is not obligated to keep his
promise. Thus, reliance depends on enforceability. Yet, the detrimental
reliance doctrine makes enforceability itself depend on reliance, hence
the circularity.<a href="#fn410" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref410"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>410</sup></a> As such, conventional theories of
contract enforcement are defective.</p>
<p>For the libertarian, another problem with detrimental reliance is
that it is not explained why a person’s “reliance” on the statements or
representations of another gives the relying person a <em>right</em> to
rely on them. Why can a person be forced to perform or liable for
failure to perform a promise just because it is “relied on” by another?
The default assumption for the libertarian is that you rely on the
statements of others at your own risk.</p>
<p>As we see, then, the mainstream theories proposed to date that are
purported to justify and explain the institution of contract have been,
by and large, inconsistent and unsatisfying.</p>
<h4 id="ii.-the-title-transfer-theory-of-contract">II. THE
TITLE-TRANSFER THEORY OF CONTRACT</h4>
<h5 id="a.-evers-rothbard-title-transfer-theory"><em>A. Evers-Rothbard
Title-Transfer Theory</em></h5>
<p>A much better grounding for contract law is found in the writings of
libertarian theorists Murray Rothbard and Williamson Evers, who advocate
a <em>title-transfer</em> theory of contract.<a href="#fn411"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411" role="doc-noteref"><sup>411</sup></a>
As Rothbard and Evers point out, a binding contract should be considered
as one or more <em>transfers of title to (alienable) property</em>,
usually title transfers exchanged for each other. A contract should have
nothing to do with promises, which at most serve as <em>evidence</em> of
a transfer of title. A contract is nothing more than a way to give
something you own to another.</p>
<p>Title may be conveyed without ever promising anything. I can, for
example, manually give you a dollar in payment for a soda. No words need
be exchanged. Or I can simply state my intention to give you something I
own: “I hereby give you my car,” or even “I hereby give you my car in
three days.” There need be no “promise” involved. In general, title is
transferred by manifesting one’s intent to transfer ownership or title
to another.<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>412</sup></a> A promise can be one way of doing
this, but it is not necessary. Rothbard and Evers seem to have a
fixation on the word “promise” and do not agree that a promise can
convey title. They appear to think that because a promise is not
enforceable, it therefore cannot serve to transfer title to property.<a
href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>413</sup></a> However, a promise can be intended
and understood to convey title, and thus can operate to do so. In
certain contexts, the making of a promise can be one way to manifest
one’s intent to transfer title. Contracts always involve communication
and some type of language, when the owner of a resource communicates his
consent to allow someone else to use or have his resource. Language is
always contextual. There is no reason that use of the word “promise”
cannot be intended to signify an intent to give contractual permission
or consent.</p>
<p>Ultimately, contracts are enforceable simply by recognizing that the
transferee, instead of the previous owner, is the current owner of the
property. If the previous owner refuses to turn over the property
transferred, he is committing an act of aggression (trespass, use of the
property of another without permission) against which force may
legitimately be used.</p>
<h5 id="b.-conditional-transfers-of-title"><em>B. Conditional Transfers
of Title</em></h5>
<p>The simplest title transfers are contemporaneous and manual. For
example I hand a beanie baby to my niece as a gift. However, most
transfers are not so simple, and are conditional. Any future-oriented
title transfer in particular is necessarily conditional, since the
future is uncertain. For example, before dinner, I tell my niece that
she gets the beanie baby after dinner <em>if</em> she behaves during
dinner. The transfer of title is future-oriented and conditional upon
certain events taking place. <em>If</em> my niece behaves, <em>then</em>
she acquires title to the beanie baby. Future transfers of title are
usually expressly conditioned upon the occurrence of some future event
or condition.</p>
<p>In addition, because the future is not certain,<a href="#fn414"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414" role="doc-noteref"><sup>414</sup></a>
all future-oriented title transfers are necessarily conditioned upon the
item to be transferred <em>existing</em> at the designated time of
transfer. Title to something that does not exist cannot be transferred.
Consider the situation where I own no hamster but tell my niece, “Here,
I give this hamster to you.” In this case, “this hamster” has no
referent so no title is transferred. Likewise, the future beanie baby
transfer is conditional not only on the expressly stated condition—the
niece performing the specified action (behaving)—but also on the
unstated condition that the beanie baby <em>exists</em> at the
designated future transfer time. During dinner, the cat might destroy
it, or it might be lost, or consumed by fire. In this case, even if the
niece behaves, there is no beanie baby left for her to acquire. In
effect, when agreeing to a future title transfer, the transfer is
inescapably accompanied by a condition: “I transfer a thing to you at a
certain time in the future—if, of course, the thing exists.”</p>
<p>Like future title transfers, title exchanges are also necessarily
conditional. This is true even of a simple, contemporaneous exchange. I
hand you my dollar and you hand me your chocolate bar. Because it is an
<em>exchange</em> rather than two unrelated transfers, the title
transfers are each conditional. I give my dollar to you only on the
condition that you give your chocolate bar to me, and vice-versa.
Exchange contracts quite often involve at least one future title
transfer which is given in exchange for either a contemporaneous or
future title transfer by the other party. In this case, each title
transfer is conditional upon the other title transfer being made. Also,
any future title transfers are conditional upon the future existence of
the thing to be transferred.</p>
<p>Many types of contracts can be formed by imposing various conditions
on the title transfers involved. For example, suppose that we make the
following wager: <em>If</em> the horse Starbucks finishes first,
<em>then</em> I transfer to you $100; otherwise, the $10 you gave me
remains mine to keep. In this case, you transferred title to $10 to me
at the moment of the wager, conditioned on my agreeing, at the moment of
the wager, to a future, conditional transfer of $100 to you. I
transferred title to $100 to you in the future, on two conditions: the
explicit condition that Starbucks wins, and the implied condition that I
have title to $100 at the designated future payment time (and that we
both exist!).</p>
<p>In a loan contract, the creditor conveys title to money (the
principal) to the debtor in exchange for a present agreement to a future
transfer of money (principal plus interest) from the debtor to the
creditor. For example, Jim borrows $1000 now from Bank to be repaid in a
year with $100 interest. Analyzed in terms of title transfers, Bank
transfers title to $1000 of its money to Jim in the present in exchange
for (conditioned on) Jim contemporaneously agreeing to a title transfer
to future property; and Jim’s future title transfer is executed in
exchange for the contemporaneous $1000 title transfer.<a href="#fn415"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>415</sup></a></p>
<p>A contract in which payment is to be made for the performance of a
service, such as an employment arrangement, is not an exchange of
titles, because the employee does not transfer any title. Although it
may be referred to as an exchange of title for services, such a contract
is better viewed as a conditional, future transfer of title to the
monetary payment, conditioned upon the specified services being
performed. That is, <em>if</em> you mow my lawn, <em>then</em> title to
this gold coin transfers to you. Again, the transfer of title in this
case is both expressly conditional and future-oriented. Title to the
coin transfers only if the lawn is mowed, and if I still own the coin.<a
href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>416</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, as evident in the beanie baby example above, the title-transfer
theory of contract permits gift contracts (donations) as well as
exchanges. The common law is reluctant to enforce gift contracts because
of the lack of consideration. Under the rubric of “hard cases make bad
law” (such as the grandfather promising to pay his granddaughter’s
tuition), such systems use the circular theory of promissory estoppel to
enforce such contracts.</p>
<p>The title-transfer theory of contract, on the other hand (like the
civil law), does not discriminate between gratuitous and onerous
contracts<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>417</sup></a>—between donations (gifts) and
mutual exchanges. The owner of property may convey title to another, for
any reason, whether pecuniary, charitable, or arbitrary, by manifesting
and communicating his intent to do so. Gifts of property or title
exchanges are all operative and, thus, enforceable.</p>
<h5 id="c.-enforcement-of-promises"><em>C. Enforcement of
Promises</em></h5>
<p>Although a variety of contractual arrangements can be constructed
using conditional transfers of title, there would seem to be no way to
compel someone to perform an agreed-upon <em>action</em>, such as a
service—the promise “to do” or “not to do” as opposed to the promise “to
give.” The only way to actually en<em>force</em> a promise to perform a
given action is to have the right to inflict, well, physical
<em>force</em>, as either punishment or inducement to perform, on the
defaulting party’s body. A promise to paint a house or sing at a party,
for example, can be enforced only by threatening to use force against
the promisor to force him to perform, or by punishing him afterwards for
failing to perform.</p>
<p>However, under libertarian theory, there are only three ways that it
is permissible to use force against the body of another: if he consents
to the force, if he is committing or has committed aggression, or if his
body is owned by someone else.</p>
<p>As noted above, the making of a promise is not the commission of
aggression. At most, promises are evidence of an intent to transfer
title. Therefore, there is no aggression to justify the enforcement
option. Assuming the promisor does not consent to being punished, the
second option is likewise unavailable. The third option assumes that the
promisor has, in effect, transferred his rights in his body to the
promisee, i.e., sold himself into slavery. However, although one may be
considered to be a self-owner, one’s body is inalienable.<a
href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref418"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>418</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore, contracts involve only conditional transfers of title to
scarce resources external to the body. Promises cannot actually be
enforced. The inability of the title-transfer theory to enforce promises
might be seen, by some, as a defect of the theory. These critics predict
chaos and the loss of the ability to have binding commitments. However,
as noted above, even in modern legal systems, there is almost never
enforcement of contractual obligations “to do” things. The primary
enforcement mechanism utilized is to order the party in breach of
contract to pay money damages to the other party, not to perform the
promised service. The inability to “enforce” promises in today’s legal
system has not resulted in the death of contract.</p>
<p>The same result can be obtained under the title-transfer theory of
contract by using conditional title-transfers to provide for “damages”
to “enforce” promises to perform. When a contract to do something is to
be formed and the parties want there to be an incentive for the
specified action to be performed, the parties agree to a
<em>conditional</em> transfer of title to a specified or determinable
sum of monetary damages, where the transfer is conditional upon the
promisor’s <em>failure</em> to perform.<a href="#fn419"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419" role="doc-noteref"><sup>419</sup></a>
This provides a result similar to today’s system where the party who
fails to perform owes monetary damages to the other party.</p>
<p>For example, if Karen wants to “hire” Ethan to paint her house, she
agrees to pay Ethan $3,000 on a specified future day X if he has painted
her house by that day. In other words, Karen makes the following
conditional conveyance of title: “I hereby transfer title to $3,000 to
Ethan on day X <em>if</em> he has painted my house (and <em>if</em> I
own $3,000).” But such a unilateral arrangement only obligates Karen.
She may want to give Ethan an extra incentive to perform (in addition to
the prospect of payment and his promise-keeping reputation). For
example, she may be planning an important business-related poolside
party at her house, for which it is important that various promisors
perform certain actions, such as mowing the lawn, cleaning the house and
the pool, and showing up to serve as waiters and chefs. She would like
to be able to obtain <em>damages</em> from Ethan in the event of
nonperformance, and can, thus, contract with him so that he agrees to
pay a specified or determinable sum of money <em>in the event that</em>
he does not perform.</p>
<p>In sum, conditional title transfers can be used to provide for
damages payable upon nonperformance of a promised service. This provides
for almost the same type of enforcement mechanism used in modern legal
systems today, in which contracts are widely used and relied upon.
Indeed, although this approach to contracts seems odd to those used to
the conventional “binding promises” view of contract, it is not really
new. As Randy Barnett observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Viewing contract law as part of a more general theory of individual
entitlements that specifies how resources may be rightly acquired
(property law), used (tort law), and transferred (contract law) is not
new.<a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>420</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="iii.-clarifications-and-applications">III. CLARIFICATIONS AND
APPLICATIONS</h4>
<h5 id="a.-transfer-of-title-to-homesteaded-resources"><em>A. Transfer
of Title to Homesteaded Resources</em></h5>
<p>The title-transfer theory of contract assumes that the property owner
can transfer title in the property to others, by manifesting his intent
to do so. The theory takes for granted that ownership of homesteaded
property is <em>alienable</em> by the will of the owner. Writes
Rothbard: “The right of property <em>implies</em> the right to make
contracts about that property: to give it away or to exchange titles of
ownership for the property of another person.”<a href="#fn421"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>421</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet, we must ask, why does manifesting one’s intent to transfer title
actually do it? Why does the owner have the power or capacity to do
this? This power is implied by several interrelated aspects of the
ownership of homesteaded property. First, note that the owner, who has
the sole right to control the resource, can permit others to use it. For
example, he can lend his car or hammer to his neighbor. This highlights
the distinction between <em>ownership</em> and <em>possession</em>. The
owner has rights to a thing even if he does not possess it. Note also
that “permitting” others to use one’s property is done by manifesting
(communicating) one’s consent to the borrower. The manifested consent of
the owner of a good to permit its use by others is what distinguishes a
licit use (such as a loan) from an illicit act (such as theft); it is
what distinguishes invited guests from trespassers. In short, because
the owner of property has the right to control it, he can, through a
sufficiently objective manifestation or communication of his consent,
permit others to possess the thing while he maintains ownership. In this
way, “contract” is just a consequence or application of ownership
rights; the owner has the right to exclude or deny permission to others
to use the owned resource, or he can consent to it. This must somehow be
communicated by language.</p>
<p>Second, homesteaded property was at one time <em>acquired</em>. It
can, therefore, also be abandoned. One is not stuck with something
forever just because one once homesteaded it. But acquiring and
abandoning both involve a manifestation of the owner’s intent. Recall
that the very purpose of property rights in scarce resources is to
prevent conflicts over the use of resources. Thus, property rights have
an unmistakably public aspect: the property claimed has boundaries
visible (manifested) to others.<a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref422" role="doc-noteref"><sup>422</sup></a> One essential aspect
of property is that it publicly demarcates one’s bounds of ownership so
others can avoid using it. If the bounds are secret or unknowable,
conflicts cannot be avoided. To know <em>that</em> a thing is owned by
another and to avoid uninvited use of the other’s property, the
property’s borders must be publicly known.</p>
<p>In fact, one reason that the first <em>possessor</em> of a scarce
resource acquires title to it is the need for borders to be objective
and public. The result of using a thing—either by transforming the thing
in an apparent way up to certain borders or by setting up a publicly
discernible border around the property—can be objectively apparent to
others. This is why Hoppe refers to acts of original appropriation as
“embordering” or “produc[ing] borderlines for things.”<a href="#fn423"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>423</sup></a></p>
<p>Acquiring is an action by which one manifests intent to own the thing
by setting up public borders.<a href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref424" role="doc-noteref"><sup>424</sup></a> Likewise, property
is abandoned, and title thereto is lost, when the owner manifests an
intent to abandon and, thereby, to relinquish ownership. This intention
is not manifested merely by suspending possession or transferring it to
another, since possession can be suspended without losing ownership.
Thus, a farmer who leaves his homesteaded farm for a week to buy
supplies in a far away city does not thereby lose ownership, nor has he
manifested any intent to abandon his farm. For these reasons, an owner
of acquired property does not abandon property merely by not-possessing
it, but he <em>does</em> have the power and the right to abandon it by
manifesting his intent to do so.</p>
<p>Ownership of acquired property includes the right to use the
property, to permit (license) others to use it (maintain ownership while
giving possession to another), and to abandon ownership by manifesting
the intent to do so. Combining these aspects of ownership, it is clear
that an owner of property can transfer title to another by “abandoning”
the good in favor of a designated new owner. If one can abandon title to
property to the world in general, then <em>a fortiori</em> one can do
“less” and simply abandon it “in favor” of a given person.<a
href="#fn425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref425"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>425</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider the case where the owner abandons the property outright. In
this case, it once more becomes unowned and available for appropriation
by a new homesteader, i.e., the next person to possess it. For example,
suppose one lends his car or hammer to a neighbor and then abandons the
item. In this case, the neighbor at first has possession, but not title,
to the object. When the owner abandons it, the car, or hammer, becomes
unowned again. As an unowned resource, it is now subject to
re-appropriation by the next possessor, who happens to be the neighbor
who is already in possession.<a href="#fn426" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref426" role="doc-noteref"><sup>426</sup></a> By combining the
power to permit others to use property with the power to abandon—both
rights or powers of <em>owners</em>—it is possible to transfer title to
a particular transferee.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to consider the general rule that the
first possessor has better title in the property than other challengers
who are, compared to the first possessor, latecomers. If property is
abandoned conditionally in favor of a particular transferee, then the
transferee has “better title” because, as between these parties, the
previous owner has abandoned it, and, thus, does not have better title.
And as between the transferee and any third party, the transferee
benefits from the prior title of the previous owner because, from the
point of view of the third parties, the transferee is a licensee of the
prior owner and/or an earlier possessor than the third parties.<a
href="#fn427" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref427"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>427</sup></a></p>
<p>As an analogy, consider a person sitting in a tree with his loaf of
bread. Below him, others occasionally pass. He can eat the bread if he
wishes, or hold onto it, or, if he wants, he can just drop it,
abandoning it to whichever passerby seeks to pick it up. This would be
analogous to outright abandonment. Or he can toss it to a particular
friend in the crowd, thus abandoning it and “guiding it” to a desired
recipient at the same time, who can then re-homestead it.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is the reason why an owner can transfer title to
others: scarce unowned resources are acquired and can be abandoned.
Property that can be abandoned by manifesting’s one’s consent to undo or
cease a previous acquisition can be given to particular others.</p>
<h5 id="b.-property-in-the-body"><em>B. Property in the Body</em></h5>
<p>Under libertarian principles, an individual has the sole right to
control his body as well as scarce resources originally appropriated by
the individual or by his ancestor in title. Since ownership means the
right to control (to exclude), an individual may be said to own his body
and homesteaded resources he has acquired. He is a “self-owner” as well
as an owner of acquired resources.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of acquired resources, the rights of ownership
include the right to transfer title to others because one can
<em>abandon</em>, by manifested intent, a previously unowned resource
that was <em>acquired</em> by manifested intent. In other words, rights
in acquired resources may be alienated at will because of the way in
which they come to be owned.</p>
<p>By contrast, although one may be said to own—rightfully control—one’s
body, the same reasoning regarding acquisition, abandonment, and
alienability does not apply. The act of acquisition presupposes that
there is an individual <em>doing the acquiring</em> and an <em>unowned
thing</em> acquired by possessing it. But how can someone “acquire” his
body? One’s body is part of one’s very identity. The body is not some
unowned resource that is acquired <em>by</em> the intentional
embordering action of some external, already existing acquirer. Or as
Professor Hoppe points out, “any indirect control of a good by a person
presupposes the direct control of this person regarding his own body;
thus, in order for a scarce good to become justifiably appropriated, the
appropriation of one’s directly controlled ‘own’ body <em>must already
be presupposed as justified</em>.”<a href="#fn428" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref428" role="doc-noteref"><sup>428</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the body is not some unowned resource that an already
existing individual chooses to acquire, it makes little sense to say
that it can be abandoned by its owner. And since alienation of property
derives from the power to abandon it, the body is inalienable. A
manifestation of intent to “sell” the body is without effect because a
person cannot, merely by an act of will, abandon his or her body. Title
to one’s body is inalienable, and it is not subject to transfer by
contract.</p>
<h5 id="c.-rothbard-on-inalienability429"><em>C. Rothbard on
Inalienability</em><a href="#fn429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>429</sup></a></h5>
<p>Rothbard, viewing contracts as transfers of title to alienable
property, rejected the enforceable-promises view of contracts, with
<em>mere promises</em> being unenforceable. He also maintained that
rights to control—i.e., one’s ownership of, or title to—one’s body were
inalienable.</p>
<p>These views are not unrelated. In fact, promises being unenforceable
necessarily implies the inalienability of the body, and vice versa. If
promises were enforceable, then one could be punished or coerced into
performing the action that had been promised, implying some rights in
the body had been alienated merely by making the promise. Likewise, if
one could alienate title to one’s body by an act of will, this would
mean that promises could be enforceable. For example, one could make a
conditional transfer of title to one’s body <em>if</em> one does not
perform a specified service. This would justify punishment or coercion
against the promisor’s body, which is now owned by the promisee. Thus,
alienability of the body and the enforceable promises view of contract
go hand in hand. One implies the other.</p>
<p>So Rothbard, in rejecting the enforceable-promises theory of
contract, has to also reject body alienability. As he does. However,
this conclusion is apparently inconsistent with other strands of his
rights theory. Rothbard wrote that “[t]he right of property
<em>implies</em> the right to make contracts about that property.”<a
href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref430"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>430</sup></a> Since he also views individuals as
“self-owners,” meaning that one owns one’s body, then one has “the right
to make contracts about that property,” according to his earlier
pronouncement. (This is, in fact, Walter Block’s view.)<a href="#fn431"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref431" role="doc-noteref"><sup>431</sup></a>
To avoid accepting body alienability, Rothbard must find a reason why
the body, although owned, is <em>not</em> alienable—even though the
owner of property “can make contracts about it.”</p>
<p>What argument does he produce to show that our bodies are not
alienable? Like other libertarians, Rothbard, in essence, argues that
slavery or other personal service contracts are not enforceable because
there is some sort of logical <em>impossibility</em> involved in
voluntarily alienating one’s rights to one’s body.<a href="#fn432"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432" role="doc-noteref"><sup>432</sup></a>
He reasons that it is literally impossible to transfer one’s actual will
to another, so a promise to do so is null and void; title thereto cannot
be transferred. It is like contracting to sell the sun to someone. Such
a contract, having an impossible object, would be null and void from the
outset.</p>
<p>The problem with this view is that it assumes that a person’s will
has to be transferred in order for him to become a slave, or for others
to have the right to control his body. But this is not necessary.
Rather, the slave owner need only have the <em>right</em> to use force
against the recalcitrant slave. It is true that one cannot alienate
<em>direct</em> control of his body; one person can only have indirect
control of another’s body. Yet, we own animals, even though the animals
retain direct control over their actions. The owner exerts indirect
control over the animal’s actions, e.g., by coercing or otherwise
manipulating the animal to get the animal to do what the owner
desires.</p>
<p>Likewise, aggressors may be jailed or punished—in short,
“enslaved”—by the victim or his agent or heirs.<a href="#fn433"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref433" role="doc-noteref"><sup>433</sup></a>
In effect, the aggressor’s body is owned by his victim. This is despite
the fact that the jailed aggressor still retains a will and direct
control of his body; the jailer can only exert indirect control over
him. The “impossibility” of an aggressor alienating his will does not
prevent him from alienating <em>title</em> to his body—giving someone
else the right to exert (admittedly indirect) control over his body—by
committing an act of aggression.</p>
<p>It would seem, therefore, that the impossibility of alienating one’s
will does not prevent a person from being owned by others, or others
from having <em>rights</em> to control the person’s body. Thus, the
impossibility of alienating the will should not be a barrier to making
contracts regarding the right to control one’s body.</p>
<p>Rothbard’s error was to presume that ownership implies the power to
transfer the property’s title: the owning-implies-selling fallacy. This
necessitated the convoluted and flawed impossibility-of-the-will
argument in favor of body-inalienability. The modified title-transfer
theory proposed here recognizes that the body is “owned” only in the
sense that a person has the sole right to control the body and repel
invasions of its borders. But the body is not homesteaded and acquired,
and cannot be abandoned by intent in the same way that homesteaded
property can.</p>
<h6 id="addendum-rothbards-mistake"><strong>1. Addendum: Rothbard’s
Mistake?</strong></h6>
<p>As pointed out in note 45, above, in the years since I published the
original article upon which this chapter is based, I have rethought some
of my criticism of Rothbard’s take on inalienability. In this chapter, I
have retained my original criticism, above, from the original article,
and will now try to explain my current perspective.<a href="#fn434"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref434"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>434</sup></a></p>
<p>In other chapters I argued that rights in our bodies stem from the
fact of our direct control of our bodies, drawing on Hoppe’s arguments,
while property rights in external, previously unowned resources arise
from original appropriation or title transfer from a previous owner by
contract or for purposes of rectification.<a href="#fn435"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435" role="doc-noteref"><sup>435</sup></a>
I have a better claim to my body than others since I have direct control
over it, which gives me a more objective link to the resource of my body
than to anyone else, who compared to me can at best have only indirect
control of my body. Now when someone commits an act of aggression, he
therefore, in effect, gives irrevocable permission to the victim to use
force against the aggressor’s body for purposes of self-defense or
proportionate retaliation or rectification.</p>
<p>But in the case of an attempted voluntary slavery contract, the
promisor, by saying, “I promise to be your slave,” or “I give my body to
you” does not commit an act of aggression. It does not create any victim
who has a right to retaliate against him. So if the would-be slave
decides to renege on his promise and run off, the would-be master has no
right to use force to stop him. It is always current consent that
matters. If a girl promises a kiss at the end of the date and the
boyfriend an hour later kisses her, she cannot claim it was
nonconsensual. In effect, she communicated her consent, she set up a
standing presumption that is reasonable to rely on—until and unless she
changes her mind. If at the end of the date she announces she no longer
wants a kiss, it is <em>that</em> consent that matters. It is always the
most recent consent that matters since this is the best evidence for
what was consented to. There is nothing in libertarianism that says
people cannot change their minds. To simply state that you can make an
irrevocable, binding promise is just question-begging since it is just
another way of sneaking in the assumption that our bodies are alienable,
even though our rights to our body do not stem from homesteading or
acquisition but rather from our direct control of them.</p>
<p>In other words, the fundamental argument against the enforceability
of voluntary slavery contracts is that ownership of bodies is based on
the person’s direct control over their body. But this is similar to the
“will” that Rothbard relies on in his opposition to voluntary slavery.
So, as noted in the section above, when Rothbard says voluntary slavery
contracts are illegitimate since it is impossible to alienate one’s
will—he is basically right. Without committing an act of aggression,
that is. And promising to be a slave is not an act of aggression.<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>436</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="d.-theft-and-debtors-prison"><em>D. Theft and Debtors’
Prison</em></h5>
<p>Although he rejects the enforceability of voluntary slavery
contracts, Rothbard inconsistently views failure to pay a debt or other
agreed upon future title transfer as “implicit theft.” Writes
Rothbard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The debtor who refuses to pay his debt has stolen the property of the
creditor. If the debtor is able to pay but conceals his assets, then his
clear act of theft is compounded by fraud. But even if the defaulting
debtor is not able to pay, he has <em>still</em> stolen the property of
the creditor by not making his agreed-upon delivery of the creditor’s
property.<a href="#fn437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref437"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>437</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rothbard is partly correct here. If, on the due date, the debtor is
able to pay, then refusal to pay is theft. This is because the title to
some of the money held by the debtor transferred to the creditor on the
due date. At that moment, the debtor is in possession of the creditor’s
property. Failure to turn it over is tantamount to theft or trespass—it
is a use of the creditor’s property without his permission.</p>
<p>But Rothbard’s view that it is theft “even if the defaulting debtor
is not able to pay” is confused. Rothbard senses that this could justify
debtors’ prison, which is tantamount to voluntary slavery, which he has
already rejected. So he tries to avoid this result by arguing that
imprisoning a defaulting debtor goes “far beyond proportional
punishment” and, thus, is “excessive.”<a href="#fn438"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref438" role="doc-noteref"><sup>438</sup></a>
But why? If failure to pay a debt is “implicit theft,” why can’t the
“thief” be treated as such and punished?</p>
<p>One reason Rothbard has to come up with a convoluted argument to
avoid the voluntary slavery implicit in debtor’s prison is that he
didn’t follow his own contract theory to its logical conclusion. He
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen a debtor purchases a good in exchange for a promise of future
payment, the good cannot be considered his property until the agreed
contract has been fulfilled and payment made. Until then, it remains the
creditor’s property, and nonpayment would be equivalent to theft of the
creditor’s property.<a href="#fn439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref439"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>439</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the mistake that leads him to also classify failure to repay
a debt as “implicit theft.” Suppose creditor-lender <em>A</em> loans
$1000 to debtor-borrower <em>B</em> in exchange for <em>B</em> paying
$1100 (principal plus interest) to <em>A</em> in a year. Now the very
purpose of loaning money is to enable the borrower to <em>spend</em> it
on some project. For example, <em>B</em> needs to pay <em>C</em> for
supplies to start his snow-cone stand business. The hope is that the
business is successful, <em>B</em> makes a profit, and is able pay
<em>A</em> $1100. But for <em>B</em> to use or spend the money, to pay
<em>C</em>, he has to fully own the money, unconditionally. In this
bilateral and mutual arrangement, there are two title transfers: a
present, unconditional transfer of $1000 now; a future, uncertain, and
conditional payment of $1100 in the future. Why is the second transfer
conditional? Because the future is uncertain. Future things don’t yet
exist. They might never come to exist. <em>B</em>’s business may fail.
He may be dead. He may be bankrupt. <em>A</em> is well aware of this
and, in fact, this is one reason he charges interest.</p>
<p>Rothbard has lost sight here of the necessity that any property
rights schema be able to answer the question of who can use what
resource <em>now</em>, rather than waiting for some future information,
otherwise people would not be able to survive because they could not use
resources to produce and consume in the present.<a href="#fn440"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440" role="doc-noteref"><sup>440</sup></a>
So the idea of implicit theft leads Rothbard to assume that debtor’s
prison is in principle justifiable, which then forces him to wriggle out
of it by simply declaring it to be disproportionate punishment. The
entire concept of “implicit theft” must be rejected as hopelessly
muddled and incompatible with libertarian principles of property rights
and justice.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we do not need such a convoluted argument to condemn
debtor’s prison. The real reason the defaulting debtor may not be
punished is that he is simply not a thief at all. If the debtor is
bankrupt, there is no property to steal. The debtor is not “refusing” to
turn over “the” money owed. There <em>is</em> no money to be turned
over. How can there be theft of a non-existent thing? As discussed
above, all future title transfers are necessarily conditioned on the
thing’s existing at the specified transfer time. Failure to transfer
something that does not exist cannot be theft; rather, one of the
conditions for the title transfer has simply not been satisfied.<a
href="#fn441" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref441"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>441</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, contracts would normally contain default or explicitly
spelled out ancillary title transfers to address the unavoidable
possibility of future default. For instance, a default title transfer
that is ancillary to the main title transfers might be that the debtor
also transfers title to $1100 plus accrued interest at any time after
the original due date if he is unable to repay on the due date, if and
when he gets a paycheck or otherwise comes into money. Such ancillary
provisions can be explicit in written contracts or be assumed as default
provisions in accordance with custom and context.</p>
<h5 id="e.-fraud"><em>E. Fraud</em></h5>
<p>As noted earlier,<a href="#fn442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref442"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>442</sup></a> libertarians often claim to
believe in the non-aggression principle, or NAP, and that the NAP
prohibits not only the initiation of force against the person of someone
else (self-ownership) but also prohibits the use of force against the
<em>property</em> of someone else—<em>or threats</em> thereof, <em>or
fraud</em>.<a href="#fn443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref443"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>443</sup></a> But including owned resources
under the NAP rubric is somewhat awkward, since aggression would seem to
literally refer to physically attacking another’s body. And then threats
and fraud are just tacked on. As I previously noted, using the NAP as a
shorthand for this cluster of relative rights is fine as long it is kept
in mind that the justifications for these are different. I argued in
chapters 2, 4, and elsewhere that self-ownership rights (and thus the
prohibition on aggression) stem from each person’s direct control of his
body; but that actors also acquire property rights in external,
previously-unowned resources by original appropriation or contractual
acquisition from a previous owner. I argued in chapter 5 (section IV.F)
why threats are also types of aggression under libertarian
principles.</p>
<p>The theory of contract espoused here demonstrates that fraud is
properly viewed as a type of theft, if defined properly. The problem is
that even some libertarians use the term loosely, which leads to error.
Sometimes it is just used to mean dishonesty; other times in support of
the idea of “implicit theft,” a concept I have criticized above.<a
href="#fn444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref444"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>444</sup></a> But because of the sloppy use of
the term, failure to provide clear definitions, and lack of appreciation
of Rothbard’s and Evers’s groundbreaking title-transfer theory of
contract elaborated, refined, and extended in this chapter, libertarian
theory is left vulnerable to criticism, such as that of James Child and
others, discussed below.</p>
<p>The only type of “fraud” that can count as a violation of libertarian
principles, is when it amounts to a type of theft. The Rothbard-Evers
title-transfer of contract (after being pruned of its confused “implicit
theft” branches) can help to make this clear. Suppose Karen buys a
bucket of <em>apples</em> from Ethan for $20.<a href="#fn445"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445" role="doc-noteref"><sup>445</sup></a>
Ethan represents the things in the bucket as being apples, in fact, as
apples of a certain nature, that is, as being fit for their normal
purpose of being eaten. Karen conditions the transfer of title to her
$20 on Ethan’s not knowingly engaging in “fraudulent” type activities,
like pawning off rotten apples. (Good faith is also a default background
interpretative condition to the contractual title transfers.)<a
href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>446</sup></a> If the apples are indeed rotten
and Ethan knows this, then he knows that he does <em>not</em> receive
ownership of or permission to use the $20, because the condition “no
fraud” is not satisfied. He is knowingly in possession of Karen’s $20
without her consent, and is, therefore, a thief.</p>
<p>This is akin to the legal notion of larceny by trick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under common law, larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away
of the personal property of another with the intent to steal. Larceny by
trick is distinguishable in that a defendant who commits larceny by
trick <em>obtains only possession of the personal property of another,
not title of that property</em>. Also, the defendant who commits larceny
by trick obtains possession of the property by intentionally making a
false statement to the victim.<a href="#fn447" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref447" role="doc-noteref"><sup>447</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This libertarian take on fraud is also more or less compatible with
conventional legal doctrines: “In law, fraud is intentional deception to
secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal
right.”<a href="#fn448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>448</sup></a></p>
<p>The reason this conception of fraud follows from libertarian property
rights principles and the title-transfer theory of contract is that
ownership of a resource (including one’s body) gives one the right to
exclude others from using the resource. The owner can grant permission
or deny permission by communicating his consent to others. In the case
of alienable, owned things, the owner can allow someone to use the thing
temporarily (loaning my car to a friend for a day), give it outright (a
gift), or agree to give up title to it in exchange for some act or other
title transfer from the other party. This is what contracting
<em>is</em>: the exercise of property rights by the owner communicating
his consent about who can use the property and under what conditions. If
I loan you my car, you are the temporary possessor, not the owner.
Possession and ownership are distinct. I can transfer ownership but not
possession, or vice-versa; or both; or neither. In the example above,
when Ethan takes possession of Karen’s $20, he only has possession, not
ownership, since Karen made the transfer of title to the money
conditional upon the apples being genuine.<a href="#fn449"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref449"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>449</sup></a></p>
<p>Once understood this way, the criticisms of libertarianism for being
unable to justify fraud law can be seen as confused and flawed. James W.
Child, for example, is wrong in asserting that “the basic moral
principles of libertarianism do not support a prohibition of fraud.”<a
href="#fn450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref450"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>450</sup></a> Benjamin Ferguson argues that
Child is correct that libertarianism does not prohibit fraud, but that
we can oppose fraud by “appealing to an external theory of moral
permissibility.”<a href="#fn451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref451"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>451</sup></a> Ferguson is also incorrect, like
Child, in his first point, so the second part of his thesis is
unnecessary; libertarianism already prohibits fraud and does not need
patching with external theories.</p>
<h5 id="iv.-conclusion">IV. CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>The title-transfer theory of contract avoids the problems of
detrimental reliance and consideration-based defenses of contract. It
permits gratuitous contracts without inventing arcane doctrines or
burdensome formalities and provides a conceptually elegant theory of
contract that can provide damages for breach of promises to perform,
similar to modern legal systems.</p>
<p>This view of contract also solves the problems of voluntary slavery
contracts and debtors’ prison and avoids convoluted arguments for
inalienability. Finally, the framework presented herein provides a
justification for outlawing fraud.</p>

<p>It can reasonably be argued that capital punishment is immoral or
problematic because of the danger of executing an innocent person by
mistake.<a href="#fn452" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref452"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>452</sup></a> George Smith, in a recent
<em>Liberty</em> magazine article in which he argues against capital
punishment, does not take this approach. Instead, Smith states that
capital punishment is never permissible, even where “<em>reasonable
doubt is impossible</em> and where the crimes have been especially
heinous.”<a href="#fn453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref453"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>453</sup></a> In other words, even if we know
beyond all doubt that someone has committed murder, it is impermissible
to execute him (and also, presumably, to inflict less severe
punishment).</p>
<p>Smith bases his argument on the concept of “inalienable rights,”
rights that “cannot be transferred, surrendered, or forfeited.”<a
href="#fn454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref454"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>454</sup></a> The argument runs roughly as
follows. Libertarians must adopt one of two positions: (1) everyone has
inalienable rights, in which case even a (known) murderer may not be
executed; or (2) certain crimes may be punished with death, in which
case the theory of inalienable rights must be abandoned. In Smith’s
opinion, position (2) “would be catastrophic, for we cannot construct a
libertarian theory of justice except on a foundation of inalienable
rights.” <a href="#fn455" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref455"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>455</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith’s entire argument, then, rests on the notion that
libertarianism and justice require inalienable rights. There are either
“inalienable” rights, or there are no rights at all. Yet Smith’s
arguments for why libertarianism requires that rights be inalienable are
unpersuasive.</p>
<h4 id="standing-threats">STANDING THREATS</h4>
<p>One of Smith’s approaches is to provide an argument for capital
punishment based on the notion of self-defense and then to attack this
argument as insufficient. Smith writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some years ago during a summer conference, Randy Barnett and I sat
down to see whether we could manufacture a defense of capital
punishment. The best we could come up with was the notion of a “standing
threat.” This is based on John Locke’s treatment of reparation and
restraining, which “are the only reasons, why one Man may lawfully do
harm to another, which is that we call punishment.”<a href="#fn456"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref456"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>456</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, according to Locke, we may kill an aggressor in self-defense,
since he has placed the victim and aggressor in a “state of war.”
Similarly, a case could be made that a convicted aggressor may be
executed, on the grounds that he is a “standing threat” to others.</p>
<p>Rejecting this argument, Smith notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To kill someone as a “standing threat” in the name of self-defense
may amount to little more than a surreptitious effort to smuggle capital
punishment in through the back door of libertarian theory, having denied
it entrance through the front.<a href="#fn457" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref457" role="doc-noteref"><sup>457</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith is correct here: it is not for reasons of self-defense that a
victim has a right to punish an aggressor.<a href="#fn458"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref458" role="doc-noteref"><sup>458</sup></a>
However, this does not mean punishment (retribution or retaliation) is
impermissible, only that self-defense is not sufficient to justify
punishment.</p>
<h4 id="barnett-on-punishment">BARNETT ON PUNISHMENT</h4>
<p>Let me briefly note the following. Smith states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years [Barnett] has brilliantly elaborated on the pure theory of
restitution as the only acceptable model of libertarian punishment, and
he recognizes that the death penalty cannot be incorporated within this
model.”<a href="#fn459" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref459"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>459</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, Barnett does appear to believe that even guilty
aggressors have a right against punishment. But he does not claim to
have justified such a right in his writings on restitution. In his
published works on this issue, Barnett opposes a punishment-based system
because he believes it may deter crime less than would a
restitution-based system, and also because the unavoidable possibility
of error can lead to “infliction of harm on the <em>innocent</em>.”<a
href="#fn460" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref460"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>460</sup></a> He does not, however, provide a
strong argument that punishing an actual aggressor violates his rights.
Indeed, in his book <em>The Structure of Liberty</em>, Barnett states:
“this analysis <em>cannot conclusively prove</em> that no combination of
compensation or punishment can ever address effectively the compliance
problem.”<a href="#fn461" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref461"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>461</sup></a> And further: “I do not claim to
have completely demonstrated this proposition [that justice requires
restitution, not punishment] either in my earlier writings, or in this
book.”<a href="#fn462" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref462"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>462</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, although Barnett opposes punishment for a variety of reasons,<a
href="#fn463" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref463"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>463</sup></a> those that are given to buttress
his case in favor of restitution do not rest on viewing rights as
inalienable and, in my view, Barnett has never demonstrated that rights
are inalienable in the sense used by Smith.<a href="#fn464"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref464"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>464</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="defense-restitution-and-inalienability">DEFENSE, RESTITUTION,
AND INALIENABILITY</h4>
<p>Another problem with Smith’s assertion that rights are inalienable is
just that: it is merely an assertion. Simply labeling rights over and
over again with the modifier “inalienable” does not make it so.<a
href="#fn465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref465"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>465</sup></a> Libertarians do not typically view
rights as “inalienable” in Smith’s sense, or put much weight on this
concept. In fact, viewing rights as alienable is perfectly consistent
with—indeed, implied by—the libertarian non-aggression principle.<a
href="#fn466" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref466"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>466</sup></a> Under this principle, only the
<em>initiation</em> of force is prohibited; defensive, restitutive, or
retaliatory force—more generally, “responsive” force—is not. One
<em>does</em> alienate or forfeit certain rights by committing acts of
aggression.<a href="#fn467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref467"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>467</sup></a> This is exactly why it is
permissible to use force to defend against or punish aggression, or to
obtain restitution. One has a natural, not inalienable, right to be free
from aggression.</p>
<p>Both defensive and restitutive force, like punitive (retributive or
retaliatory) force, imply some alienation of rights. This is just why
defensive or restitutive force is considered to be permissible: because
the aggressor has alienated his right to be free of such force. If one
is opposed to punishment on inalienability grounds, how can one then
endorse defensive or restitutive force? As John Goodman correctly notes,
Smith’s argument against the death penalty is an argument against
punishment as such, and even against defensive or restitutive force.<a
href="#fn468" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref468"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>468</sup></a> Thus, to be consistent, Smith has
to either object to <em>any</em> use of force against an aggressor,
including even self-defense, or admit that rights are not truly
inalienable.<a href="#fn469" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref469"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>469</sup></a></p>
<p>So which is it? Is Smith inconsistent, or does he consistently object
to all force? Smith has apparently flip-flopped on this issue. At first,
he seems to acknowledge that rights are not really inalienable: “I agree
with Locke that reparation (restitution) and restraint (self-defense)
are the only justified uses of violence in a free society.”<a
href="#fn470" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref470"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>470</sup></a> But a justified use of violence
implies some alienation of rights. Yet later, Smith appears to change
his mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goodman argues that my case against capital punishment, if
consistently applied, would militate against all forms of punishment,
<em>such as fines and imprisonment</em>. I freely concede that this is a
major problem for the libertarian theory of restitution…. Can we
imprison someone and compel him to work off his debt? … These and other
questions have not been adequately examined, much less answered, by
libertarians, and I remain uncertain about how to deal with them.<a
href="#fn471" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref471"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>471</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith’s view of the inalienability of rights has clearly led him down
a dead end. If he is consistent, he must condemn all uses of force, even
defensive and restitutive. (Such a position might be referred to as
“stupid,” or, perhaps, “Darwinian,” pacifism.)<a href="#fn472"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref472" role="doc-noteref"><sup>472</sup></a>
If, however, he admits that defensive and restitutive force are
permissible, he has admitted rights are not inalienable, and thus, he
cannot oppose punishment on grounds of inalienability.</p>
<h4 id="the-right-of-proportional-punishment">THE RIGHT OF PROPORTIONAL
PUNISHMENT</h4>
<p>As I have argued at greater length elsewhere,<a href="#fn473"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref473" role="doc-noteref"><sup>473</sup></a>
an individual has a right to use force against an aggressor in response
to aggression. This right to use force can be utilized for a variety of
purposes: for self-defense during or before the act of aggression, for
revenge, to obtain restitution (or rectification), to prevent the
aggressor from committing further crimes, or to deter others from
committing crimes. What the victim wants to use the right <em>for</em>
is his business. But the reason <em>why</em> a victim has a right to
retaliate or defend against an aggressor is that the aggressor cannot
coherently withhold his consent to retaliatory, defensive, or
restitutive force (these may be considered different types of
<em>responsive</em> force, that is, <em>non-initiated</em> force, force
which is <em>in response to</em> initiated force). To use related legal
terminology, the aggressor is “estopped,” or precluded, from denying the
victim’s right to use (proportional) responsive force, since such a
denial would contradict the aggressor’s view that the use of force
<em>is</em> permissible (the view ineluctably demonstrated by the act of
aggression).<a href="#fn474" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref474"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>474</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, eye-for-an-eye type proportional punishments are legitimate in
response to aggression. A murderer, therefore, is estopped from
objecting to his own capital punishment. He can no longer claim a right
to be free from such treatment. Since he previously had such a right,
the right that he previously had must have evaporated. We may say, then,
that his right to not have force used against him has been alienated (or
forfeited, waived, abandoned, relinquished, surrendered, or lost; the
terminology is not important).<a href="#fn475" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref475" role="doc-noteref"><sup>475</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-utility-of-punishment">THE UTILITY OF PUNISHMENT</h4>
<p>There are further errors in Smith’s article. Consider, for example,
Smith’s view that restitution is superior to punishment as a basis for
criminal justice. Smith argues that punishing an aggressor “does not
restore or equalize rights; it simply wipes out another set of rights,”
and that allowing retaliation only provides, at most, “a sense of
emotional balance” to the victim. Several responses to this argument can
be made. First, Smith here begs the question of whether rights are
inalienable by assuming that the aggressor <em>has</em> a set of rights
to be violated. If the aggressor’s rights were alienated, proportionally
punishing him does not “wipe out his rights,” as he had none left to
wipe out.</p>
<p>Second, just because punishment does not restore rights, it is not
clear why restitution is automatically superior, since restitution does
not restore rights either. It is true that the consequences and fact of
an act of aggression can never be undone. The indignity will always have
been suffered. Any response by a victim, including restitution and
retribution, will always be an imperfect remedy. Indeed, this is one
reason why aggression is impermissible: because the harm done thereby is
literally undoable, incalculable, and not subject to an adequate
remedy.<a href="#fn476" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref476"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>476</sup></a> A victim will always remain, to
some extent, a victim.</p>
<p>This does not, however, dictate that the victim should be
artificially restricted in choosing among various imperfect remedies.
Admittedly, both inflicting punishment on an aggressor (retribution) and
extracting monetary damages from him (restitution) are imperfect
remedies. But why not let the victim decide which one, or which
combination of these, he prefers?<a href="#fn477" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref477" role="doc-noteref"><sup>477</sup></a> After all, the
victim did not ask to be made a victim. He did not ask to be put in the
position of having only two imperfect possible remedies available to
him. If a victim prefers to torture his torturer, who is Smith to say
that the victim’s preference is not rational? Unlike Smith, I am not so
unwilling to allow victims to attempt to attain “a sense of emotional
balance,” if that is all that is possible to them. (Like Barnett,
however, I am concerned about the unavoidable possibility of mistakenly
punishing the innocent, and thus admit the appeal of a restitution-based
system in order to avoid punishing innocents, but not for reasons of
inalienability.)<a href="#fn478" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref478"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>478</sup></a></p>
<p>The right to inflict (proportional) punishment on one’s aggressor can
be useful in other ways as well. Most significantly, perhaps, it may be
utilized to reach a more objective determination of the proper amount of
restitution. For example, the victim may trade all or part of his right
to retaliate for a payment (“ransom”) or other service by the aggressor,
i.e., the aggressor buys his way out of punishment.<a href="#fn479"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref479" role="doc-noteref"><sup>479</sup></a>
A serious aggression leads to the right to inflict more severe
punishment on the aggressor, which would thus tend to be traded for a
higher average amount of ransom or restitution than for comparatively
minor crimes. Further, a victim especially offended or traumatized by
aggression (and thus subjectively “damaged” more severely) will tend to
bargain for a higher ransom. Also, richer aggressors will tend to be
willing to pay more ransom to avoid the punishment the victim has a
right to inflict.<a href="#fn480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref480"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>480</sup></a> Thus, allowing punishment to be
traded for damages solves the so-called millionaire or billionaire
problem faced under a pure restitution system, where a rich man may
commit crimes with impunity, since he can simply pay easily-affordable
restitution after committing the crime.</p>
<p>For these reasons, allowing the option of punishment can help arrive
at a more objective measure of restitution damages.<a href="#fn481"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref481" role="doc-noteref"><sup>481</sup></a>
And even if punishment is banned and is not an actual option—because of
the possibility of mistakenly punishing innocents, say—an award of
restitution can be <em>based</em> on the model of punishment. E.g., a
jury could be instructed to award the victim an amount of money it
believes he <em>could</em> bargain for, given all the circumstances,
<em>if</em> he could threaten to punish the aggressor. This can lead to
more just and objective restitution awards than would result if the jury
is simply told to award the amount of damages it “feels” is “fair.”<a
href="#fn482" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref482"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>482</sup></a></p>
<p>The right to retaliate could also be used to justify “enslaving” the
aggressor and putting him to work for a time to generate income for the
victim (restitutionists like Barnett support this use of force against
the aggressor, but do not consider it to be punitive, but rather
necessary to enforce restitution).<a href="#fn483" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref483" role="doc-noteref"><sup>483</sup></a> Or suppose an
aggressor is very poor and otherwise unable to pay monetary damages to
the victim. In this case, the threat of inflicting severe punishment on
the aggressor may induce the aggressor’s relatives or friends to pay off
the victim to spare the aggressor from being punished. The victim would
thereby be compensated even though the aggressor is penniless, whereas
the victim would be totally uncompensated if no threat of punishment
were available to motivate the aggressor’s relatives to chip in. (In a
restitution-based system, a poor aggressor who is imprisoned in a
work-facility designed to generate income payable to the victim may also
find friends and relatives to pay off part of his debt to have him
released earlier. However, as the aggressor in this case faces only a
limited and usually temporary form of “slavery” and not more severe
punishment, the motivation for others to bail him out would probably be
reduced.)<a href="#fn484" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref484"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>484</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="inalienability">INALIENABILITY</h4>
<p>The theory of inalienability has been plagued by confusion,
vagueness, and inconsistency. The concept is typically applied to the
issue of whether a <em>non-aggressor</em> can alienate his rights by a
mere contract or promise, i.e., by a peaceful action. For example, may
one sell oneself into slavery or enter into a binding, enforceable
contract to perform services? Libertarians come down on both sides of
this question, but tend to say that rights are “inalienable,” i.e., one
may not sell oneself into slavery.<a href="#fn485" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref485" role="doc-noteref"><sup>485</sup></a> Most libertarians
hold this view of inalienability, which I will refer to as the standard
or “limited” view of inalienability, since adherents of this view
usually also maintain that acts of aggression <em>do</em> alienate
rights.<a href="#fn486" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref486"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>486</sup></a> In this view, only violent actions
serve to alienate rights. Smith has used the label “inalienability” in
an idiosyncratic way to mean that even <em>aggressive</em> actions do
not alienate rights.</p>
<p>What, then, is the correct, libertarian view of inalienability and
rights? Consent is the crucial element to focus on here. If a person
consents to an action that would otherwise violate his rights, there is
no rights violation. Boxers in a ring, or duelers dueling, do not have
their rights violated when struck by fist or bullet. This is because
they consented to these exchanges of force.<a href="#fn487"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref487" role="doc-noteref"><sup>487</sup></a>
To alienate one’s right <em>means that</em> one is <em>unable</em> to
withhold consent to some action that would otherwise infringe the right
if there were no consent. Thus, a right is alienated by somehow
rendering it impossible to object to the action that the alienated right
would otherwise prohibit. One does something <em>now</em> that prevents
one from withholding consent in the future, thereby effectively
alienating the relevant right. To alienate a right, then, is to
<em>irrevocably</em> grant the relevant consent to another.</p>
<p>Is it possible to irrevocably grant consent? Smith, an advocate of
what may be called the “strong” view of inalienability, would say it is
not possible under any circumstances (except, perhaps, for defensive or
restitutive force). Proponents of the limited view of inalienability, by
contrast, hold that it is possible to do this by aggressing, but not by
merely making an agreement or promise. (Those rare libertarians, like
Walter Block, who believe rights may be alienated even by a non-violent
action like agreement, hold what may be viewed as a “weak” view of
inalienability.)<a href="#fn488" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref488"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>488</sup></a></p>
<p>Let us examine the three ways that consent possibly could be
irrevocably granted: by physical means, by aggression, and by voluntary
agreement. The physical, or physiological, means refers to a person
voluntarily undergoing some process that literally places him under the
power of another (e.g., drugs, surgery, technology).<a href="#fn489"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref489" role="doc-noteref"><sup>489</sup></a>
This is akin to committing an act of suicide or “zombicide,” and is not
of particular interest, since after the zombicide is complete, the
zombie presumably does not even try to run away or withhold consent from
his master.</p>
<p>Committing an act of aggression is a clear-cut means for alienating
(some of) one’s rights. As explained above,<a href="#fn490"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref490" role="doc-noteref"><sup>490</sup></a>
an aggressor is estopped from withholding consent to the victim’s
proposed use of (proportional) retaliatory force, since such a denial
would contradict the aggressor’s view that the use of force is
permissible. An act of aggression is a way of irrevocably granting
consent to punishment. This is exactly why an act of aggression serves
to alienate rights: because the act of aggression conclusively
demonstrates the aggressor’s view that aggression is proper, thus
precluding him from consistently objecting to the victim’s use of
(proportional) retaliatory force. The strong view of inalienability
(Smith’s view) is, for this reason, untenable.<a href="#fn491"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref491" role="doc-noteref"><sup>491</sup></a>
So which view is correct, the limited view or the weak view?</p>
<p>This depends on the answer to the following question: Can one
irrevocably grant consent by voluntary agreement, such as a promise or
contract to be another’s slave? Barnett recognizes the importance of
consent here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The crucial question … is whether Ann’s current consensual choices
can limit her right to revoke her consent in the future. Having
consented to let Ben touch her or to enter the [boxing] ring with him,
may she be forced to carry through with her commitment after she has
changed her mind?“<a href="#fn492" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref492"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>492</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a difficult and complicated question. Some argue that a
contract is a contract, and may be enforced.<a href="#fn493"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref493" role="doc-noteref"><sup>493</sup></a>
This view is based on the theory that one is a self-owner, entitled to
full control of all of one’s property, including one’s body, and that
this control comprises the ability to sell one’s body.<a href="#fn494"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref494" role="doc-noteref"><sup>494</sup></a>
Most libertarians, however, seem to hold the limited view of
inalienability, whereby aggression does alienate rights, but promising
to be someone’s slave does not. Advocates of this view typically argue
that such contracts are not enforceable because there is some sort of
logical impossibility involved in voluntarily alienating all of one’s
rights in this manner.<a href="#fn495" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref495" role="doc-noteref"><sup>495</sup></a> For example, some
argue that it is literally impossible to transfer one’s actual will to
another, and thus a promise to do so is null and void; title thereto
cannot be transferred. It is like contracting to sell the sun to
someone. Such a contract, having an impossible object, would be null and
void from the outset.</p>
<p>My view is that the impossibility reasoning typically given to argue
that consent cannot be irrevocably granted is fallacious and has helped
to muddle the issue of inalienability. For example, if the
“impossibility” of literally alienating one’s will means that it is
impossible to be bound by contract to act as someone’s slave, why is it
not “impossible” to imprison an aggressor to enforce restitution? After
all, even a convicted aggressor still has a will. Why is it not
“impossible” to defend oneself with force? And yet it is <em>not</em>
impossible for consent to be irrevocably granted, as we have seen; this
condition exists for a justly imprisoned aggressor. Recipients of
defensive, restitutive, or retaliatory force all retain a will, which is
overwhelmed with some type of responsive force.</p>
<p>The key here is to focus on force and consent, for to keep someone as
a slave, it is not necessary that the will be physically alienated.
Rather, in order to enslave someone, the slave-owner must be
<em>entitled</em> to use (justified in using) force against the slave if
the slave disobeys or tries to run away. The impossibility of actually
alienating one’s faculty of volition is irrelevant. It is the legitimacy
of using force that matters, and this depends on consent.</p>
<p>Putting the issue this way, however, provides a different argument
why consent cannot irrevocably be granted by mere agreement or
promise—why the prospective slave may change his mind in the future and
withdraw his consent. If <em>A</em> promises (or contracts, or agrees;
the terminology is not important) to be <em>B</em>’s slave, this is no
doubt an attempt to consent <em>now</em> to force inflicted in the
future. If <em>A</em> later changes his mind and tries to run away, may
<em>B</em> at that point use force against <em>A</em>?</p>
<p>This is the crucial question. If the answer is yes, this means that
<em>A</em> has no right to object and has effectively alienated his
rights. I would say no, however, simply because there is no reason why
<em>A</em> <em>cannot</em> withdraw his consent. Libertarianism does not
say one cannot change one’s mind. When we ask about consent, it is the
most recent expression of consent that is most relevant. Unlike the case
of aggression, where the aggressor’s prior aggression estops him from
objecting to the use of retaliatory force, <em>A has not committed
aggression</em> against <em>B</em>. Thus it is not inconsistent for
<em>A</em> to later object to the use of force. All <em>A</em> did
previously was utter words to <em>B</em> such as “I agree to be your
slave.” But this does not aggress against <em>B</em> at all, any more
than does uttering the insult, “You are ugly.” Words per se do not
aggress, which is one reason there is a (derivative, not independent)
“right” to free speech. In a nutshell, a would-be slave-owner must be
entitled to use force against the would-be slave in order for the
slavery agreement to be enforceable and for rights to be alienated in
this manner; but the would-be slave has simply not initiated force
against the would-be slave-owner. The would-be slave-owner is thus
<em>not</em> entitled to use force against the slave; hence no rights
were alienated.<a href="#fn496" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref496"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>496</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, I conclude that a slavery agreement is not enforceable. Rights
are not completely inalienable, as Smith contends, for aggression can
alienate rights. We must reject the strong view of inalienability.
However, rights are inalienable in the limited (and more conventional)
sense that one cannot irrevocably grant consent to aggression in the
future by way of a mere promise or agreement. This is not because of any
impossibility in alienating one’s will, but because a promisor has not
committed aggression. One retains the right to change one’s mind, absent
special circumstances.<a href="#fn497" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref497" role="doc-noteref"><sup>497</sup></a> The limited view of
inalienability seems to be the most sensible.</p>
<p>The right to alienate external resources is not limited, however,
because of crucial differences between rights pertaining to one’s body
and rights of ownership in previously-unowned, homesteaded resources.
The right to appropriate external resources is derivative of and
distinct from the basic right against non-aggression (self-ownership).
External scarce resources are appropriated and acquired, and held by
intention (it is this that distinguishes ownership from possession),<a
href="#fn498" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref498"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>498</sup></a> and thus can be abandoned or
alienated by a sufficient expression of intention, e.g., a contract or
act of abandonment. For this reason, under the libertarian
title-transfer theory of contract, one can alienate particular property
titles, i.e., titles to external (homesteadable) scarce resources. In
this sense there is a distinction between title to property, which is
alienable by mere contract; and rights related to one’s body, which are
not alienable by promise or contract (speech act) but are alienable by
acts of aggression.<a href="#fn499" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref499"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>499</sup></a></p>
<p>To summarize, then, one may object to certain acts of aggression; or
one may grant consent to allow the otherwise-prohibited action to take
place. The right against aggression may be alienated, but only by
<em>irrevocably granting</em> consent, which may be done only by
committing an act of aggression. A non-violent action such as a promise
or agreement to do something with one’s body, on the other hand, does
not alienate rights, because the consent may be withdrawn at any time in
the future, with certain exceptions. This is because a promise now to
consent in the future to violence does not commit aggression against the
promisee, and because a future change of mind revokes the consent.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion-1">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>If Smith is right that even a murderer has a right to not be killed,
then it is wrongful aggression to kill the aggressor, just as it is
wrongful aggression for a murderer to kill the victim. Then it is no
longer the initiation of force that is impermissible; it is force in
general, even retaliatory, defensive, or restitutive force. Without a
right to respond to aggression, the non-aggression principle goes out
the window, as does the distinction between aggressor and victim.
Smith’s defense of the strong version of inalienable rights thus
undermines what is surely the heart of libertarianism, the
non-aggression principle.</p>
<h4 id="appendix"><strong>APPENDIX</strong><br />
</h4>
<h5 id="lefevres-pacifism">LEFEVRE’S PACIFISM</h5>
<p>As noted above, the material here was originally intended to appear
in footnote 21, above. Due to its length, I include this material in
this appendix.</p>
<p>As noted in the text, the consistent pacifist must condemn all uses
of force, even defensive and restitutive, and that libertarian Robert
LeFevre has been accused of holding such views. However, as alluded to
above, it is not clear that LeFevre took his pacifism so far. As LeFevre
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Protection</em> is what we do <em>prior</em> to the commission of
a criminal act which does, in fact, <em>prevent</em> such an act from
occurring….</p>
<p>Protection, because of the fact that it prevents a trespass from
occurring, is <em>always moral</em>….</p>
<p><em>Defense</em>, on the other hand, is what we do during an attack
by someone else. It is what takes place in what is called the “hot
encounter.” You are walking down the street and a man comes up to you,
sticks a gun in your face, and demands your money. Now you are face to
face with an attacker. You cannot <em>protect</em> yourself (i.e.,
prevent the attack); it is too late for that. Now you must defend
yourself (i.e., ward off the attack).</p>
<p>As long as your actions are for the sole purpose of <em>warding
off</em> the attack, you would not be guilty of an immoral act yourself.
But if your actions serve the purpose of <em>attacking</em> the
criminal, you are guilty of a trespass even though the other man
initiated the attack….</p>
<p>Suppose, in the situation outlined above, the other man takes a swing
at you. Clearly, you can raise your arm to ward off his blow. This is
<em>defense</em>. If, however, you then bring your arm down upon his
head and begin attacking him, you are no longer defending yourself, but
attacking the other man. This would be immoral, as it is a trespass upon
the other person.<a href="#fn500" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref500"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>500</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I disagree with this pacifist view, it seems some
libertarians mischaracterize LeFevre as opposing violence in
self-defense. E.g., writes Rothbard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If every man has the absolute right to his justly-held property it
then follows that he has the right to <em>keep</em> that property—to
defend it by violence against violent invasion. Absolute pacifists who
also assert their belief in property rights—such as Mr. Robert
LeFevre—are caught in an inescapable inner contradiction: for if a man
owns property and yet is denied the right to defend it against attack,
then it is clear that a very important aspect of that ownership is being
denied to him. To say that someone has the absolute right to a certain
property but lacks the right to defend it against attack or invasion is
also to say that he does <em>not</em> have total right to that
property.<a href="#fn501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref501"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>501</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies LeFevre opposes the right to self-defense, to “defend …
against attack.” See also the comments of Todd Lewis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While most libertarians view the right to use lethal force to defend
one’s body and physical property as naturally flowing from a strict
reading of the Non-Aggression Principle, there is at least one
little-known libertarian, the late great Robert LeFevre, who took an
even more radical position on violence. Not only did he eschew the
initiation of violence; he also eschewed the use of violence in one’s
own self-defense.<a href="#fn502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref502"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>502</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither Rothbard nor Lewis provide any citations to LeFevre to back
up this characterization of his views on violence used in
self-defense.<a href="#fn503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref503"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>503</sup></a> Thus, in the absence of any
further writing by LeFevre on this subject (which may well exist), I
have to conclude that the accusations of him adopting such an extreme
pacifist view are unfounded.</p>

<h4 id="two-related-fallacies">TWO RELATED FALLACIES</h4>
<p>I want to explore two related beliefs, which I think are fallacious,
and they stem from confusions about core libertarian principles and
confusions introduced by the sloppy use of language and overuse of
metaphorical thinking. And, by the way, I did touch on this topic in
less detail at the PFS [Property and Freedom Society] here in 2011, when
I talked about a bunch of libertarian misconceptions, and also in a
“Libertarian Controversies” lecture from Mises Academy about 10 years
ago.<a href="#fn504" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref504"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>504</sup></a></p>
<p>So, the first fallacy: <em>Ownership implies selling</em>. Walter
Block uses this a lot. In fact, I heard him say it explicitly last week
again in Nashville at the Libertarian Scholars Conference. So the idea
is this: if you own yourself—that is, you own your body—you should be
able to sell it. So, a voluntary slavery contract should be enforceable.
And if the legal system does not permit voluntary slavery, then it means
you really don’t own yourself. So the implicit assumption behind this
argument is that one inherent aspect of ownership is the right or
ability to sell.<a href="#fn505" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref505"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>505</sup></a> In other words, it is assumed that
“ownership” necessarily includes the ancillary “right to sell.” It’s
taken for granted that “if you own something, you can sell it.” This is
a mistaken assumption, as I shall explain presently.</p>
<p>Fallacy two: <em>Selling implies ownership</em>. So, some contracts
that we’re used to are exchanges of <em>owned things</em>. Consider some
simple ones: an apple for an orange, 10 chickens for a pig, 1 ounce of
gold for a horse, or $3 for a cup of coffee. Now, we also have labor
contracts, where it’s considered to be a sale of a service, which
implies that you “own your labor” because, after all, you “sold” it. And
also there’s the sale of knowledge, information, or know-how—like
teachers who get paid to give information, publishers, speakers,
contracts for transfer of know-how, and so on. And this argument is also
used to argue for intellectual property. People say, “Well, if you can
sell your idea, you must have owned it, so intellectual property is a
legitimate concept.” Similarly with Bitcoin: people say that Bitcoin can
be possessed, and sold, so Bitcoins must be owned and ownable things.<a
href="#fn506" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref506"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>506</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="scarcity-and-property-rights">SCARCITY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS</h4>
<p>Now, let’s revisit some elementary categories of libertarian thought.
So first of all, action is when humans in the world employ means or
scarce resources as tools to help achieve their ends or goals. When
there’s society—other human actors—there’s a possibility of conflict in
the use of these resources. Now, it’s good that we live in society,
because we have the division and specialization of labor, trade, and
intercourse with other people. But there can also be conflict among
human actors in the use of these scarce resources, including our bodies,
because of the nature of these resources.</p>
<p>So what this means is the scarce resources, which we employ as human
actors in a purely economic sense, are precisely <em>things over which
there can be conflicts</em>. So sometimes, to avoid confusion, I will
refer to these things as rivalrous, or <em>contestable</em> or
<em>conflictable</em> resources.<a href="#fn507" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref507" role="doc-noteref"><sup>507</sup></a> They are the types
of things over which there can be conflict. I find<br />
I sometimes need to emphasize this aspect and avoid the term “scarce
resources” because, quite often, an intellectual property proponent will
say something like, well, “I don’t know about you, but good ideas is
pretty scarce.” They can’t easily say that good ideas are
<em>conflictable</em> (or rivalrous), though. The point is information
is not the type of thing that can be subject to property rights or
ownership.<a href="#fn508" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref508"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>508</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="property-rights"><em>Property Rights</em></h4>
<p>Now, in civilized society, property or ownership rights are assigned
to reduce this conflict.<a href="#fn509" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref509" role="doc-noteref"><sup>509</sup></a> So what are property
rights? All rights are human rights, and all human rights just are
property rights,<a href="#fn510" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref510"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>510</sup></a> because the very purpose of
property rights is to avoid conflict over scarce (rivalrous,
conflictable) resources. So ownership means property rights. To own a
thing is to have a property right in the thing. So it’s actually better
to refer to property as the <em>relationship between</em> a person and a
thing, although, over time, we sometimes are careless with language, and
we will refer to the thing itself as property. Like we’ll say, “That car
is my property.” But precise language would be, “I have a property right
in that thing, in that car,” or “I own that car.”<a href="#fn511"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref511"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>511</sup></a></p>
<p>All right: so, ownership and property rights. A property right in a
thing gives the owner the right to use it. This is what property rights
are. Now, to be more precise, which is—this precision is not necessary
for today’s discussion, but—owning a thing actually does not literally
give you the <em>right to use it</em>, but it gives you the <em>right to
prevent others from using it</em>. It’s an exclusionary right.<a
href="#fn512" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref512"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>512</sup></a> As a practical matter, that
<em>usually</em> gives you the <em>ability</em> to use the thing. So,
for example, if you own a gun, that means you can prevent anyone else
from using the gun. But it doesn’t mean you have the unlimited right to
use the gun, because other people have property rights, and their
property rights proscribe your actions. So I can’t use the gun to shoot
someone.</p>
<h4 id="property-rights-as-limits-on-action"><em>Property Rights as
Limits on Action</em></h4>
<p>Now, most people make the mistake of saying, well, this shows that
property rights are limited. But this is actually incorrect. The reason
I can’t shoot the gun at my neighbor is <em>because</em> he has a
property right in his own body. His property rights are a limitation on
what <em>actions</em> I can perform. They are <em>not</em> a limitation
on my property rights in my gun. In fact, if I had a stolen gun, which I
didn’t own, I still couldn’t shoot my neighbor. Ownership of the gun—the
means employed—has nothing to do with why am prohibited from shooting
him. So the ownership of the gun is not limited by property rights. I
can’t shoot an innocent person with a gun that I own <em>or</em> with a
stolen gun. The innocent person’s <em>property rights in his body</em>
limit what <em>actions</em> I can perform, with whatever causally
efficacious scarce means, whether it’s a resource I own or not. It’s a
limit on my actions, not on property rights. Because the essence of a
property right is the right to exclude others, not the right to use.</p>
<p>This mistake is used also to argue for intellectual property because
people will say—well, I’ll point out that intellectual property rights
restrict other property rights, so they’re actually an infringement of
property rights because they’re effectively a nonconsensual negative
servitude because, if I have a patent, I can prevent you from using your
factory to make iPhones. So that’s a limitation on your use of your
property.<a href="#fn513" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref513"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>513</sup></a></p>
<p>And the response will be, “Well, all property rights limit other
people’s property rights.” The implicit argument here is that just
because patents limit property rights, that’s no problem to patents
being genuine property rights, because all property rights limit other
property rights.<a href="#fn514" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref514"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>514</sup></a> But that’s not true. Property
rights limit only actions. And the owner of a factory making iPhones is
not committing any action that invades the borders of anyone else’s
property. So that’s why that’s another fallacy. It’s a related fallacy
but not the one I’m addressing directly today.</p>
<p>So: libertarianism and property rights. The purpose of property
rights is to permit conflicts over the use of scarce resources to be
avoided. So they assign these exclusive rights so that others can avoid
the conflict.</p>
<h4 id="property-rights-and-objective-link"><em>Property Rights and
Objective Link</em></h4>
<p>So how does this work? The property rights are assigned in accordance
with whichever actor has the <em>best link</em> or connection to the
resource.<a href="#fn515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref515"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>515</sup></a> This is the only way you can have
a workable system of property rights, because any system of property
rights has to be voluntarily respected, and for it to be voluntarily
respected, it has to be seen as objectively fair, which means it can’t
be based upon arbitrary differences like “I have the right to rule you,
and you don’t have the right to rule me because I’m me, and you’re you.”
That’s a <em>particularistic</em> rule.<a href="#fn516"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref516" role="doc-noteref"><sup>516</sup></a>
Or “I have the right to your land because I’m stronger.”</p>
<p>Those types of arguments and reasons are not justifications. There
has to be an objective best link.<a href="#fn517" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref517" role="doc-noteref"><sup>517</sup></a> So how does that
work out? In Western private law and in libertarianism, which is a far
more consistent working out of this, there are basically two types of
links—the type of link applied to your body, which is a unique scarce
resource; and the type of link applied to external resources in the
world, which were <em>previously unowned</em> scarce resources. For the
body, the link is a self-ownership link. You own your body, and the
reason is because of your direct control over it, which I will get to in
a minute.</p>
<p>And then for scarce resources in the world, they’re always owned
first by someone first using them from their unowned state. That’s
called <em>homesteading</em> or <em>original appropriation</em>. And
then ownership can be <em>transferred</em> for two reasons:
<em>contractually</em>—that’s a voluntary transfer of your ownership
title of the resource to someone else, either by sale or by gift; or for
purposes of <em>rectification</em>, which can be seen as a subset of
contract because it’s also a transfer of title from an owner to someone,
but it’s because the owner committed a tort against the victim and thus
gave him a right to recover some of the aggressor’s property as
damages.</p>
<p>So <em>original appropriation</em>, <em>contract</em>, and
<em>rectification</em> are basically the only three principles to
determine ownership of external resources in case of a dispute. So these
four principles—body-ownership due to direct control, with an exception
made for forfeiture of this right due to committing aggression,<a
href="#fn518" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref518"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>518</sup></a> plus the three principles for
external resources—are how we determine the best link, and this is the
core of all property rights, and of all just law. A developed body of
private law, to be just, has to be based on these core principles, and
just entails working out the details as the law develops.<a
href="#fn519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref519"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>519</sup></a> And every socialist system, and
every law not based on these core principles, including IP law, always
ends up deviating from these core private property law principles in one
way or another.</p>
<h4 id="self-ownership"><em>Self-Ownership</em></h4>
<p>Now, so we commonly use the term “self-ownership.” This is another
phrase that can be misleading because you can have people object to it
and say, well, how can you own yourself, because that’s a religious view
because it implies that your “self” is different than your body or
something like that, and they’ll criticize it that way.<a href="#fn520"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref520"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>520</sup></a></p>
<p>So to be precise, self-ownership is just a shorthand for body
ownership, because your body is a scarce resource. Your “self” is not a
scarce resource. The notion of “self” is bound up with the concept of
personality and the person that you are, your identity as a person in
the world, as an actor, as an agent. So <em>every person is the
presumptive owner of his body</em>. That’s the basic libertarian rule.
We don’t need to get into controversial metaphysics to understand this
basic norm or rule.</p>
<p>Now, by the way, I say “presumptive” because it’s not absolute; it’s
defeasible. The self-ownership right can be lost by committing
aggression, because the victim has the right to defend himself during a
crime or to retaliate after.<a href="#fn521" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref521" role="doc-noteref"><sup>521</sup></a> And when they do
that, they’re using the body of the aggressor without his consent.<a
href="#fn522" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref522"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>522</sup></a> So he’s, in a sense, lost
ownership of his body to the extent that the victim needs to be able to
use force against him to obtain justice.</p>
<p>So the basis here of self-ownership, or body-ownership, is not
homesteading, but it’s the direct control over your body. This is the
<em>best</em> <em>link</em> between the given actor and the resource of
his human body. And actually, I think the first person who explicitly
recognized this was Professor Hoppe in a German publication in 1987.<a
href="#fn523" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref523"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>523</sup></a> You actually weren’t explicit
about this in your later English book, but it’s implicit in there.<a
href="#fn524" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref524"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>524</sup></a> And if you remember, you told me
about that passage, and you translated it for me for my article.</p>
<p>And so Hoppe’s argument is that you own your body because you
directly control it. So this gives each person or actor logical-temporal
priority or precedence as compared to anyone’s indirect control. What
that means is, if you were to enslave someone or claim to own their
body, the only way to control that body is by coercion, by directing
threats of force to get them to act the way you want them to act. But in
that case, they’re the ones still directly controlling it, and that
always has precedence, and it’s a better link than the indirect control
I can exert over you by coercion. Not to mention that the coercer
himself would be in contradiction because he claims ownership of his
body for the purpose of being the one who can punish you or threaten
you.</p>
<p>So this is what the best link means here. It’s not homesteading,
although people think it’s homesteading. It can’t be homesteading
because to homestead means you’re an actor in the world, already a
self-owner, or body-owner, and you find an unowned resource, and you
appropriate it to yourself. But this presupposes there’s already a
person with a body, so it’s impossible to imagine that you homestead
your body unless you have some religious view where the soul goes down
there and grabs it. But that’s not the domain of science as I think
Guido [Hülsmann] and Mises would agree.<a href="#fn525"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref525" role="doc-noteref"><sup>525</sup></a>
We could make an analogy. We could say that when a child “wakes up” at
the moment when he becomes sapient enough to be said to have rights, he
homesteads himself. But it’s really a loose analogy. It just means
that’s the point in time in which he’s a person with rights. It’s not
like his body was unowned, and he just homesteaded it.</p>
<h4 id="external-resources"><em>External Resources</em></h4>
<p>Now, as for external resources, these are things that were
<em>previously</em> <em>unowned</em>. This is a key point, and they’re
external to the human body, so they’re not part of people’s bodies. So
in this case, as I said earlier, the best link is determined by the
three principles. First, we have original appropriation or homesteading.
What this means is you <em>possess</em> something, which is an
<em>economic</em> <em>category</em>. It means to be able to use or
manipulate. Mises—I’ll get to this later, but Mises calls it catallactic
or sociological ownership, but what he really means is
<em>possession</em>, which is—and this is important—an <em>economic</em>
category. So mere possession, like Crusoe on an island—in a
Robinsonade—he can never “own” anything because there’s no society to
have norms with respect to. He controls, and he uses things. He
<em>possesses</em> these things as means, he exercises “factual
authority” over these things—but he doesn’t own them.<a href="#fn526"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref526"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>526</sup></a></p>
<p>In society, where there are property rights norms, you can also do
the same thing. You can just possess something and not intend to own
it—you pick up a stick and throw it away. Or you can possess it with the
intent to own, and you take certain steps to transform it or to put a
barrier up around it, or to, as Hoppe calls it, emborder it, which
basically means to put up a visible public link between you and the
thing demonstrating to everyone that this thing is no longer unowned, to
say, “I’m claiming ownership of it.”<a href="#fn527"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref527"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>527</sup></a></p>
<p>This requires the merger or the combination of actual possession or
transformation or embordering—with then intent to own.<a href="#fn528"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref528" role="doc-noteref"><sup>528</sup></a>
So those two things are essential to owning a thing that was previously
unowned. And then, once you own a thing, you can contractually transfer
it to someone by your intent, your consent, and I’ll get to the
mechanics of that in a moment. And then, again, there can also be a
transfer as rectification—if you have to transfer something to someone
to compensate them for damages you caused them by a tort (an uninvited
use of their property).</p>
<p>Okay. Oh, and by the way, this formulation of rights that I just went
through, this way of looking at the best link and the breakdown between
the body, I’m happy that I was able to help the Mises Caucus<br />
in the US get this basic formulation put into the Libertarian Party
Platform<a href="#fn529" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref529"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>529</sup></a> last May at the “Reno Reset,” as
we call it. Up until this time, there was no definition of aggression in
the Libertarian Party platform. It was just implied.<a href="#fn530"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref530"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>530</sup></a></p>
<h4
id="contract-selling-and-ownership-external-scarce-resources"><em>Contract,
Selling and Ownership: External Scarce Resources</em></h4>
<p>Getting back to the problem of confusing selling and ownership, of
thinking there’s a necessary relationship between them. <em>How</em> do
we sell an external resource that we own, like the contractual title
transfer we talked about early? So: when you own a resource, because the
ownership requires the merger of possession and the intent to own, you
can lose ownership by losing the intent to own, by making it clear you
no longer intend to own the resource. This is abandonment. So if you
acquire a thing, you can “unacquire” it, so to speak. And because of
this, it gives you the ability to sell because you can basically abandon
it “in favor” of someone else.<a href="#fn531" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref531" role="doc-noteref"><sup>531</sup></a></p>
<p>Imagine you’re in a tree, and you have an apple, and there’s people
walking by, below you. You can kind of toss the apple to whoever you
want. You can drop it so that whoever you want will catch it. You can
direct this—you can direct the re-homesteading, in effect. So if I have
an apple and I give it to you to hold temporarily, you’re the possessor,
but you’re not the owner. I’m the owner, but I’m not the possessor. So
ownership and possession are distinct concepts and statuses. But if
you’re holding my apple, and if I then abandon it, now you’re holding an
unowned apple, and you can just re-homestead it right away. So that’s
the mechanics, the juristic or legal mechanics, of why and how you can
sell things.<a href="#fn532" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref532"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>532</sup></a> So the way that we come to own
unowned resources is <em>the reason why</em> they can be sold. So it’s
not an incident or aspect of ownership <em>per se</em>. It’s an aspect
of the way external things come to be owned.</p>
<h4 id="fallacy-1-you-can-sell-what-you-own"><em>Fallacy 1: You Can Sell
What You Own</em></h4>
<p>Now, what about selling yourself, your “self,” i.e., your body, like
Walter Block thinks we can do? Keep in mind: external things can be sold
because they were <em>previously unowned</em> and <em>acquired</em> by
an actor-owner who is <em>already a self-owner</em>, and he can abandon
it. But your body rights don’t arise by homesteading or by your intent
to own yourself. They arise because of the best link based upon your
direct control.</p>
<p>So if I try to make a contract, “I promise to sell” or “I promise to
be your slave forever,” <em>those words do not change the fact that I
still have the best link to my body</em>. And because my words are not
an act of aggression—which is the only way to come to own someone else’s
body, by them forfeiting their rights by committing a crime—then
promising to be someone’s slave is simply not enforceable because it
doesn’t transfer any title to anything. You still own your body because
you still have direct control and thus the better link. You can always
change your mind, in other words.</p>
<p>So Rothbard seems to notice this in his kind of convoluted arguments
in his contract theory. But it’s implied, perhaps unknowingly, and later
clarified by Hoppe. In any case, Rothbard wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is true that man, being what he is, cannot absolutely guarantee
lifelong service to another under a voluntary arrangement. Thus,
Jackson, at present, might agree to labor under Crusoe’s direction for
life, in return for food, clothing, etc., but he cannot guarantee that
he will not change his mind at some point in the future and decide to
leave. In this sense, a man’s own person and will is “inalienable,”
i.e., cannot be given up to someone else for any future period.<a
href="#fn533" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref533"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>533</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I think the reason he focuses on the fact that the will is
inalienable is that Rothbard senses that that’s <em>the reason</em> you
own your body, although he never quite says it explicitly, but he gets
really close. I mean, what’s the relevance of the fact that your will is
inalienable to the legitimacy or enforceability of a voluntary slavery
contract? The only relevance could be that your direct control, or your
will, is the reason you own your body.<a href="#fn534"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref534"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>534</sup></a></p>
<p>Okay, so again, after you promise to be a slave, you still have
direct control, so you’re still the owner, and you have not committed
aggression, so you can always <em>change your mind</em> (in contrast to
an aggressor who, as noted above, has <em>irrevocably</em> granted
consent, since he cannot undo the historical fact of the
aggression).</p>
<h4 id="fallacy-2-you-own-what-you-sell"><em>Fallacy 2: You Own What You
Sell</em></h4>
<p>Okay, now what about the other fallacy—owning what you sell? In a
simple exchange, for two material resources that are both owned by two
different people like an apple for an orange or an apple for a silver
coin, the sellers do own what they sell. There are two title transfers:
The orange changes ownership, and the apple changes ownership.</p>
<p>But in a “sale” of service, labor, or information, the contract
<em>in legal terms</em><a href="#fn535" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref535" role="doc-noteref"><sup>535</sup></a> only involves
<em>one title transfer.</em> This is in legal terms—whatever is “paid”
to the person performing the service. So if I give you a chicken to pay
you for giving me a haircut, the title to the chicken transfers to you.
But you don’t transfer title to any labor to me. It’s not like there’s a
bucket of labor, which I’m handing over to you. So these are
<em>actions</em>, not things that can be owned.<a href="#fn536"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref536" role="doc-noteref"><sup>536</sup></a>
So labor or services or actions are what we <em>do with</em> things that
we own like our bodies or other owned resources. They’re not themselves
owned resources. So you don’t really sell labor, in a legal sense. So
why do we describe it this way?</p>
<h4
id="economic-vs.-normative-realms-of-analysis-ownership-vs.-possession"><em>Economic
vs. Normative Realms of Analysis: Ownership vs. Possession</em></h4>
<p>Now, here’s what I think is the reason for the confusion. There are
different modes of understanding for different realms of phenomena and
different conceptual frameworks. So, for example, in the teleological
versus causal realms, we have human action and purposive behavior on the
one hand versus causal laws of nature on the other. We have praxeology
versus the empirical method, the scientific method. We have apodictic or
<em>a priori</em> versus tentative or contingent knowledge. We also have
normative or juristic, legal, types or realms of understanding versus
factual. And human laws and norms versus empirical facts.</p>
<p>I’m getting to the point. So, now, Mises was careful to distinguish
the juristic or the legal or the <em>should</em> from the factual, but
he used the word “ownership” in both, which is potentially confusing. So
he said: “Regarded as a sociological category”—this was in
<em>Socialism</em> in 1922, he changed the word to catallactic later,
probably because he hadn’t come up with the term catallactics yet. I
don’t know. But he calls it the sociological or economic category of
ownership, which is the <em>power to use a good</em>. Now, that’s
possession. That’s what we would call possession or control.<a
href="#fn537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref537"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>537</sup></a> The “factual authority” mentioned
previously.</p>
<p>And then he says the sociological and juristic (by which he means
legal or normative) concepts of ownership are different. “Ownership”
(really: possession) from the sociological (economic; descriptive) point
of view is the <em>having</em> of a good. It’s just what Crusoe could
do. So that’s natural or original “ownership,” and it’s a purely
physical relationship of man to goods. But the legal is the “should
have.” Who should have it? Who has a right to it? This is where property
rights and law come in. And later in <em>Human Action</em>, he goes on
in a similar vein.<a href="#fn538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref538"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>538</sup></a></p>
<p>So as I said earlier, it’s better to distinguish ownership and
possession, to use those words rather than two senses of the word
ownership, because it could be potentially confusing because people say
they own Bitcoins, but what they really mean is they possess Bitcoins.
People say they own their minds, but your mind is just an epiphenomenon
of your physical brain—you own your brain; you can change your mind, but
you can’t change your brain. They’re different concepts. A dead body has
a brain, but it doesn’t have a mind. The brain weights three pounds; the
mind doesn’t weigh anything.</p>
<p>There’s a well-known Roman law, civil law scholar who passed away a
couple years ago, from Greece, but he was a Louisiana law professor,
A.N. Yiannopoulos. And he defines, and the Louisiana Civil Code also
defines, possession as actual control or the “factual authority” a
person has over a corporeal or a material thing.<a href="#fn539"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref539" role="doc-noteref"><sup>539</sup></a>
I like these phraseologies. And again, calling Bitcoin possession
“ownership” is one reason for the confused idea that it’s ownable. So if
you say I possess a Bitcoin, that’s fine. But it doesn’t imply that you
own it. Plus, Bitcoins can be sold, and so people think if you sell
something, you must own it, so that’s why they make that mistake. But
they are referring to the economic description of the actions—saying I
“sold” a bitcoin is a way of describing why the buyer gave me money: to
obtain possession of “my” bitcoin—not to the juristic nature of the
transaction, which is a one-way title transfer (of the money).<a
href="#fn540" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref540"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>540</sup></a></p>
<p>Yiannopoulos also points out something I mentioned earlier—that the
accurate use of the word <em>property</em> should be the designation of
rights people have with respect to things. In other words, property is
not the thing itself. It’s the relationship between you and the thing.<a
href="#fn541" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref541"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>541</sup></a> I have a property right in the
thing. I’m the owner of the thing.<a href="#fn542" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref542" role="doc-noteref"><sup>542</sup></a> (And by thing I mean
an ownable, conflictable resource.)</p>
<p>So: why do we refer to a sale of labor or information when, as I
already pointed out, there’s only a one-way title transfer of the
payment made to the labor performer? Why do we call it that? What
happens is, just like in the way the word ownership is used in both
senses sometimes to mean possession or economic “ownership,” or juristic
ownership or real ownership, we use the word sale in that way too.
Sometimes we use it as economists to <em>describe</em> the structure of
a given human action; and sometimes we use it as lawyers to describe the
rights that are transferred.<a href="#fn543" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref543" role="doc-noteref"><sup>543</sup></a></p>
<p>So in (libertarian) law, “sell” refers to transferring title to an
owned thing. So you don’t literally sell your labor. You just perform
your labor. You perform some action. But in economics, it can be used to
describe or characterize an action. So all action from an economic point
of view involves an actor using scarce means to pursue some goal or
purpose. So when we try to describe what someone does, we try to discern
their goals and purposes, and also the means that they’re using.<a
href="#fn544" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref544"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>544</sup></a> So that’s what history does as
well, right, which Guido was mentioning earlier.<a href="#fn545"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref545" role="doc-noteref"><sup>545</sup></a>
We try to understand or characterize the actions of people within a
means-ends (praxeological) framework.</p>
<p>So when we say as an economist, “<em>A</em> sold his labor to
<em>B</em>,” this is just a concise way of explaining the praxeological
nature of that action. We’re explaining <em>why</em> <em>A</em>
performed the action, his labor. Well, he performed it to get money from
<em>B</em>. So we’re describing his goal. His goal was to get money from
<em>B</em>. That’s why he engaged in the means of using his body to
perform an action, which he knew would satisfy <em>B</em>. And why did
<em>B</em> transfer ownership of his money to <em>A</em>—he actually did
legally sell his money to <em>A</em> because he transfers title to the
money to <em>A</em>—to induce him to perform an action. So there’s only
one title transfer.</p>
<p>So in this case, the economic and the juristic uses of the word
“sell” are different because, in legal terms, <em>B</em> transfers money
to <em>A</em> conditional on him performing an action. There’s only one
title transfer—the money that was transferred. But in economic terms,
<em>A</em> sells his labor to <em>B</em> “in exchange” for money, and
<em>B</em> sells his money to <em>A</em> “in exchange” for A’s action.
So we can use selling (or exchange) in an economic sense, but we should
be careful. Otherwise, you might end up justifying intellectual
property.<a href="#fn546" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref546"

12: Reply to Van Dun: Non-Aggression and Title Transfer<sup>*</sup></h3>
<p><sup>*</sup> Originally published as Kinsella, “Reply to Van Dun:
Non-Aggression and Title Transfer,” <em>J. Libertarian Stud.</em> 18,
no. 2 (Spring 2004): 55–64.</p>
<p>In a recent issue of <em>The Journal of Libertarian Studies</em>,
Fran van Dun commented on my views on intellectual property and Walter
Block’s views on blackmail.<a href="#fn547" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref547" role="doc-noteref"><sup>547</sup></a> In this reply, I
will concentrate on two aspects of Van Dun’s comments: the
non-aggression principle and libertarianism, and trademark and
contract.</p>
<h4 id="the-non-aggression-principle-and-libertarianism">THE
NON-AGGRESSION PRINCIPLE AND LIBERTARIANISM</h4>
<p>Van Dun criticizes Block and me for using “the so-called Rothbardian
non-aggression rule as the foundation or axiom for libertarian
jurisprudence.” For although “[n]on-aggression is an important and valid
rule of libertarian jurisprudence,” it is “inadequate from a libertarian
point of view.” Rather than being the foundation of libertarian theory,
Van Dun argues, it is only an implication of the libertarian philosophy
of law.<a href="#fn548" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref548"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>548</sup></a></p>
<p>After such a claim, one might expect Van Dun to provide a critique or
denial of the principle of non-aggression followed by an explanation of
the contours of the proper theory of law. However, Van Dun seems to
accept the non-aggression rule. He uses the concept of “aggression in
the traditional sense of a physically invasive, non-defensive use of
force (violence) against another person or his property,”<a
href="#fn549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref549"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>549</sup></a> just as Rothbardians do. He
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no problem with the thesis that, in a libertarian legal order,
no individual or group—least of all those who are engaged in the
administration of justice—should aggress against any person or any
person’s property. Aggression, in the libertarian sense of the word, is
the physical invasion of another person’s domain without that person’s
consent and without lawful justification. As such, aggression is
unlawful and should therefore be illegal in a libertarian legal order
(because such an order is intended to be as true to law as is humanly
possible). Nor do I have a problem with the thesis that violent border
crossings are lawful and therefore legally permissible if and only if
they are committed in self-defence, to bring a criminal to justice, or
to exact restitution or compensation for an unlawfully inflicted harm.
They are permissible to the extent that they are themselves compatible
with the requirements of justice.<a href="#fn550" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref550" role="doc-noteref"><sup>550</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not follow from those theses that defensive use of force is
justified or lawful only in response to aggressive violent invasions of
persons or property. It does not follow that only aggression against
another person or his property is unlawful. There may be unlawful acts
that are not invasions of a person’s physical domain, yet justify the
defensive use of force to prevent, stop, or exact compensation for such
acts.<a href="#fn551" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref551"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>551</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Dun goes on to state even more explicitly his view of the
relation between aggression and what is properly regarded as
“unlawful”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block and Kinsella proceed with their arguments on the supposition
that such acts are not unlawful because they are not aggressions.
Accordingly, they also suppose that the use of force in retaliation
against such acts must itself be an aggression, and therefore unlawful.
<em>In their system of thought, the dichotomy of aggression and
non-aggression coincides with the logical opposition between unlawful
and lawful acts.</em><a href="#fn552" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref552"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>552</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Van Dun explains in a brief outline at the end of the paper, in
his view, libertarian theory tells us what should be <em>unlawful</em>,
by which term he seems to mean a rights violation or against natural
law.<a href="#fn553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref553"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>553</sup></a> For Van Dun, “unlawful” means the
type of conduct that should be made illegal (against positive law). As
he writes, “aggression is unlawful and should <em>therefore</em> be
illegal in a libertarian legal order.”<a href="#fn554"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref554" role="doc-noteref"><sup>554</sup></a>
Thus, libertarianism is concerned with what is <em>lawful</em> and
<em>unlawful</em>, or with what should be made illegal.</p>
<p>Van Dun states that while physical aggression is one type of
unlawfulness, it is not true “that <em>only</em> physical invasions of
another’s person or property are unlawful.”<a href="#fn555"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref555" role="doc-noteref"><sup>555</sup></a>
Because aggression is only one type of unlawfulness, he writes, other
unlawful things may also be made illegal. Such things include trademark
infringement, libel, or blackmail.</p>
<p>I hope that I have accurately summarized this aspect of Van Dun’s
thought. Now I do not deny that the non-aggression principle might not
be an “axiom” in the Randian sense and that it might be the result of,
or dependent on, more basic truths or reasons.<a href="#fn556"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref556" role="doc-noteref"><sup>556</sup></a>
But a given theory of law either is or is not compatible with the rule.
It seems that Van Dun wants to have it both ways. He is quite correct
that, as Block and I see it, “the dichotomy of aggression and
non-aggression coincides with the logical opposition between unlawful
and lawful acts.”<a href="#fn557" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref557"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>557</sup></a> The reason for this is that to
declare something “unlawful” means it should be made illegal, meaning
that force may be used to oppose the unlawful action. The libertarian
believes, I submit, that the only case in which force is justified is if
it is in response to an initiated act of force. Otherwise, the outlawing
of the conduct is itself an initiation of force.</p>
<p>Van Dun, though, says that the category of unlawful conduct is
broader than aggression. This means conduct other than aggression may
be—nay, should be—outlawed. Which means that violence should be wielded
against innocent people who have not engaged in aggression. However,
since it is not in response to aggression, this is initiated force. For
this reason, I fail to see how one can admit that aggression should be
unlawful but maintain that things other than aggression are also
unlawful. If aggression is unlawful, then nothing else can be, because
outlawing non-aggression is itself aggression.</p>
<p>In my view, Van Dun cannot really agree with the non-aggression
principle if he is going to adhere to his “broader” view of
unlawfulness. Rather, to follow this line of reasoning, it would be more
consistent to state that many, even most, acts of aggression are
unlawful, but that some types of aggression are not unlawful—namely, the
violent suppression of some types of non-aggressive conduct (e.g.,
libel). But then it would be plain that this theory supports, at least
in some cases, the infliction of violent force against those who have
not themselves initiated force. This does not seem very libertarian.</p>
<p>Before I turn to Van Dun’s critique of some of my intellectual
property views, a brief digression. Van Dun states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A libertarian legal theory must be founded on a sound philosophy of
law if it is to have any chance of holding its ground in serious
intellectual debate. Block and Kinsella do not provide such a
philosophy. They assume instead that it can be found in Rothbard’s
writings.<a href="#fn558" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref558"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>558</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Van Dun continues, “Rothbard explicitly warned his readers
that he himself was merely presupposing the validity of the theory of
natural law and would not attempt ‘a full-scale defense of that
theory.’”<a href="#fn559" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref559"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>559</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, just as Van Dun cannot set forth his entire legal theory in his
article, so I did not in mine, but I did not and do not rely only on
Rothbard. To the contrary, I cited my own work and that of Hans-Hermann
Hoppe, which elsewhere set forth a defense of the non-aggression
principle.<a href="#fn560" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref560"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>560</sup></a> Hoppe’s argumentation or discourse
ethics approach, in particular, is a powerful defense of the standard
non-aggression-based libertarian view. And it is one Van Dun and I both
agree with.</p>
<p>If I am right, Van Dun must reject the non-aggression principle in
favor of his view that unlawfulness is not based on or equated with
aggression, so that not only aggression may be outlawed. But what I find
a bit puzzling is that Van Dun himself employs discourse ethics, in a
way similar to Hoppe, to show that “principles of private property and
uncoerced exchange” are also presupposed by participants in discourse.<a
href="#fn561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref561"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>561</sup></a> In other words, as Hoppe argues,
the non-aggression principle does have a justification in the nature of
peaceful discourse; it is not simply an arbitrary “axiom.” Therefore, it
is unclear to me why Van Dun refuses to embrace the non-aggression
principle and opposes building a foundation on it. It seems that his own
“dialogue ethics” theory, like that of Hoppe, also shows that the
non-aggression rule is, in fact, justified and correct.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-and-contract">TRADEMARK AND CONTRACT</h4>
<p>Van Dun seems to agree with the main portion of my paper on
intellectual property, that patent and copyright laws are unlibertarian.
However, he takes issue with my comments with respect to trademark, the
relevant portions of which are provided here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose some Lachmannian changes the name on his failing hamburger
chain from LachmannBurgers to RothbardBurgers, which is already the name
of another hamburger chain. I, as a consumer, am hungry for a
RothbardBurger. I see one of the fake RothbardBurger joints run by the
stealthy Lachmannian, and I buy a burger. Under current law, Rothbard,
the “owner” of the RothbardBurgers trademark, can prevent the
Lachmannian from using the mark RothbardBurgers to sell burgers because
it is “confusingly similar” to his own trademark. That is, it is likely
to mislead consumers as to the true source of the goods purchased. The
law, then, gives a right to the trademark holder against the trademark
infringer.</p>
<p>In my view, it is the <em>consumers</em> whose rights are violated,
not the trademark holder’s. In the foregoing example, I (the consumer)
thought I was buying a RothbardBurger, but instead got a crummy
LachmannBurger with its weird kaleidoscopic sauce. I should have a right
to sue the Lachmannian for fraud and breach of contract (not to mention
intentional infliction of emotional distress and misrepresentation of
praxeological truths). However, it is difficult to see how this act of
fraud, perpetrated by the Lachmannian on <em>me</em>, violates
<em>Rothbard’s</em> rights. The Lachmannian’s actions do not physically
invade Rothbard’s property. He does not even convince others to do this;
at most, he may be said to convince third parties to take an action
within their rights, namely, to buy a burger from the Lachmannian
instead of Rothbard. Thus, it would appear that, under libertarianism,
trademark law should give <em>consumers</em>, not trademark
<em>users</em>, the right to sue trademark pirates.<a href="#fn562"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref562"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>562</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Dun maintains that “it is … difficult to see how trademark piracy
could violate the consumer’s rights if it was not a violation of the
trademark holder’s right.”<a href="#fn563" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref563" role="doc-noteref"><sup>563</sup></a> Van Dun mounts an
escalating series of criticisms of the alleged implications of my
trademark views. Most seem to rest on his conclusion that, under my
theory, one cannot say that the consumer has a fraud or breach of
contract claim. He reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Kinsella, the consumer supposedly is defrauded because
the L-Burger chain misrepresented itself to the consumer. The latter
therefore should have a right to sue the L-Burger chain for “fraud and
breach of contract.” That is a strange conclusion, for it is not at all
clear what contract L-Burger breached. The consumer presumably got what
he paid for: a burger. If L-Burger acted within its legal rights under
the Kinsella Code in using the R-Burger trademark, the consumer should
know that a trademark carries no legally relevant information.
Kinsella’s argument—the consumer thought he bought an R-Burger, but
instead got a crummy L-Burger—is simply irrelevant. The consumer’s
expectations would have been equally frustrated if he had bought at
R-Burger when, unbeknownst to him, that chain had hired another chef
with the same tastes as his counterpart at L-Burger or had changed its
production processes or suppliers. Should any of these things also
constitute a violation of the consumer’s rights?<a href="#fn564"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref564"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>564</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I acknowledge the reasoning was somewhat compressed. In a 53-page
paper devoted primarily to patent and copyright, I devoted only three
paragraphs to the issue of whether trademark law can be justified. My
view that the consumer has a fraud or breach of contract claim is
obviously based on a theory of contract contained in an article
published after the intellectual property article.<a href="#fn565"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref565" role="doc-noteref"><sup>565</sup></a>
I believe Van Dun is incorrect that my
non-aggression-principle-compatible legal theory cannot support a fraud
or breach of contract claim in the context noted above.</p>
<p>As explained more fully in my contract theory chapter, libertarianism
maintains that the owner of a scarce resource has the right to use the
resource and to dispose of it. The owner is the first possessor
(homesteader) or someone who legitimately acquired the property from the
first possessor (contract). Having the right to use property implies one
may choose to exclude others from it, permit them to use or borrow it,
give or sell title to another, or abandon it. If you own something, you
can use it, hoard it, share it, destroy it (abuse), sell it (alienate)
or give or lend it to another, or abandon it. One’s choice whether to
sell something or lend it, for example, obviously must be manifested in
some way. Clearly, social interaction and property exchanges presuppose
the ability of the parties to <em>communicate</em> with each other.</p>
<p>It is the owner’s consent that distinguishes permitted use from
trespass. If my neighbor walks to my front door to borrow a cup of
sugar, she has implied permission to use my sidewalk and doorknocker for
this purpose because of default rules in the community that can be
relied on if not contradicted. This is how language and communication
work. But if I tell her she is not welcome on my property, then she is a
trespasser if she steps on it. Clearly, the manifested or communicated
consent of the owner is relevant as to whether the use of property is
permissible—whether it is a form of trespass or theft.</p>
<p>This is also true for loans and exchanges of title. If I lend my car
to someone, the permission must be communicated to him somehow. For
example, I can lend my car to my brother. His use is not trespass since
I consented to it. If a random stranger takes my car and uses it, we
call that theft because I did not consent to it.</p>
<p>But since consent is communicated and can be withheld, it need not be
all or nothing—a loan need not be a permanent gift. The consent given to
others to use one’s property can be conditional. For example, it can be
limited in time or in other ways. If I lend my car to my brother to go
to lunch and he drives off to Canada in it for a month-long vacation, he
is now using my car without my consent, and he knows this. At this
point, he is identical to the thief or other trespasser. The question to
be asked is always: Did the owner consent to the other’s use of the
property? If so, it is permissible and rightful, since an owner can
allow others to use his property. But if not, it is a type of theft or
trespass. And clearly, determining whether consent was granted
presupposes the <em>possibility of communication</em>.</p>
<p>Now, when someone sells or buys an item, the sale or purchase can be,
and usually is, conditional. For example, if I buy a candy bar for a
shilling from a vendor, I transfer title to my shilling to the vendor,
and he transfers title to the candy to me. Other customary assumptions
are viewed as implied conditions on the title transfers, but they can
also be made explicit or they can contradict default assumptions
(sometimes called suppletive law). I might state that the title to my
coin transfers <em>only</em> if the candy bar has such-and-such property
(e.g., it is unopened or fresh, or not laced with poison; although these
would probably be default or implied conditions anyway). Therefore, the
vendor receives my consent to use and take title to the coin
<em>only</em> if these conditions are met. If the vendor knowingly sells
me a five-year-old piece of chocolate, then the condition for
transferring title to the coin to him has simply not been met, and he is
aware of this. So the vendor would be aware that he does <em>not</em>
have the right to use or keep the coin—just as, in the example above, my
brother knows he may use my car to go to lunch, but that he has no right
to use it to drive to Canada.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the R-Burger/L-Burger example I gave, I assumed a
hypothetical situation in which the customer wanted an R-Burger. That
is, he wanted a burger having certain characteristics—it is fresh, has
meat and bread, and was made by a certain, identifiable company (the
R-Burger chain). When he paid for the fake R-Burger, then title to his
coin transfers to the vendor only if the conditions are met. They are
not met, because the burger was not made by the R-Burger chain, and that
was one of the customer’s conditions. Therefore, the L-Burger chain is
taking and using his coin without his consent. It is for this reason
that he should have a claim against them for trespass (which may be
couched in fraud, breach of contract, or theft terms).<a href="#fn566"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref566"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>566</sup></a></p>
<p>Van Dun might argue that it is not possible to identify the R-Burger
chain if it does not have a trademark right and that the L-Burger chain
can just rename itself “R-Burgers” too, so that when the customer asks
for an R-Burger (i.e., conditions the title transfer to the money on it
being made and sold by R-Burger), he is actually getting one. He is just
getting it from the second R-Burger company, not the first R-Burger
company.</p>
<p>However, this response would be easy to overcome. <em>It need only be
possible for the customer to adequately identify what the condition
is.</em> Language is not infinitely malleable, and communication is
(undeniably) possible. If pressed, the customer could specify that the
purchase is conditioned on the current store he is in being owned by the
same R-Burger company first started at such and such date and address,
and so on. There is no reason it would be impossible to identify a given
vendor without traditional trademark law, just as it is not impossible
to identify fellow humans, despite the fact that we do not usually have
trademarks on our names (in fact, humans often have identical names,
e.g., John Smith).</p>
<p>Van Dun’s implicit assumption here is really that communication and
identification of individuals or entities is literally impossible in the
absence of trademark rights. I believe this is one of his central
mistakes here. Van Dun seems to be so accustomed to the positive law’s
trademark framework being relied on by modern businesses and consumers
that he seems to believe accurate communication is impossible without
it. This is obviously absurd.<a href="#fn567" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref567" role="doc-noteref"><sup>567</sup></a></p>
<p>Accordingly, I submit that Van Dun is incorrect. Under libertarian
principles, property owners are free to condition the transfer of title
to their property. In a typical exchange, there are many implied
conditions, and others may be expressly added or changed. These
conditions specify when the other party has the right to take and use
the property to be transferred, just as when one lends property or
invites a guest to one’s home, the manifested consent of the owner
governs which uses by the invitee are permissible and which are
tantamount to trespass. From here, it is easy to see how selling an item
to a customer with a falsely-labeled characteristic can result in title
to the monetary payment not passing due to failure of one of the
conditions. If title does not pass, then the vendor does not have a
right to take, use, or spend the money; it is still the property of the
customer.</p>

13: Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society</h3>
<p>Originally published in the <em>Journal of Libertarian Studies</em>

and Murray Rothbard; Hoppe was then the new editor of the <em>JLS</em>

<p>I had become fascinated with the Roman/civil law (the law of
Louisiana and continental Europe) and the English common law and its
possible connections to libertarian political and legal philosophy. I
conceived of this project in law school (1988–91) at LSU, a civil-law
law school, when I was still more under the thrall of Ayn Rand and her
type of rationalism. At first I thought the more “rationalist” civil law
was more compatible with a reason- and deductivist-based approach to
politics and law than was the common law. One of my law professors, John
Devlin, suggested I read Oliver Wendell Holmes’s <em>The Common Law</em>
to counterbalance some of these views. This helped me gain an
appreciation of the English common law and decentralized legal systems
in general. I ended up concluding that decentralized legal systems—the
original Roman law, and its offspring, European civil law and the later
English common law—were more compatible with natural principles of
justice favored by libertarianism than legislated law. This article was
an attempt to highlight what is good in these ancient systems of law and
what we can draw on and use in our libertarian
theorizing.<sup>†</sup></p>

<h4 id="i.-introduction-2">I. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Libertarians’ devotion to individual rights, and to laws in support
of those rights, is unquestionable. Most of the laws favored by
libertarians can be shown to be consistent with our individual
rights—unlike the blatantly illegitimate laws advocated by socialists.
Despite this, however, many libertarians overlook important procedural
or structural requirements that must accompany any legal system in which
substantively justifiable law can develop and last.</p>
<p>In particular, the danger and futility of making law by
<em>legislation</em> is too often ignored, even by libertarians (other
than anarcho-capitalists, who oppose the existence of any government on
principle, including its legislature).<a href="#fn569"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref569" role="doc-noteref"><sup>569</sup></a>
Libertarians often, for example, advocate that the legislature enact
this or that law, or they at least support many statutes that are
already in force, such as statutes prohibiting murder. The concept of
separation of governmental powers into the legislative, executive, and
judicial branches, which many libertarians support, implies that
legislation can be a valid function of a libertarian government. But as
Italian legal theorist Bruno Leoni noted in 1961:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is … paradoxical that the very economists who support the free
market at the present time do not seem to care to consider whether a
free market could really last within a legal system centered on
legislation.<a href="#fn570" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref570"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>570</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leoni argued that legislation as such is incompatible with freedom.
If this is correct, then even statutes that seem to embody libertarian
principles simultaneously subvert those principles.</p>
<p>There is another way of forming law, however—in which law is “found”
or discovered, rather than “made”—which does not depend on legislation
or legislators. This is the way of decentralized legal systems such as
customary law, Roman law, and the English common law.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will examine the two ways of forming
law—centralized (i.e., legislation-based) and decentralized—and will
argue that only the latter is compatible with libertarian principles. I
will also examine the proper role for legal codification in light of
this conclusion.</p>
<h4 id="ii.-centralized-and-decentralized-legal-systems">II. CENTRALIZED
AND DECENTRALIZED LEGAL SYSTEMS</h4>
<h5 id="a.-civil-law-and-common-law"><em>A. Civil Law and Common
Law</em></h5>
<p>In modern times the two dominant legal systems in the world are the
common law and the continental civil law. Based on the body of English
case law that developed gradually over the centuries, the common law
spread to English colonies and commonwealths like America, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and India. Modern civil law systems are based in
part on Roman law, which, like the common law, developed many of its
important legal principles in the accumulated decisions of jurists in
thousands of cases over centuries (and which predates the common law by
centuries).<a href="#fn571" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref571"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>571</sup></a> Virtually all of Europe and many
other jurisdictions, including Louisiana, Puerto Rico, Quebec, Scotland,
and Latin America, have a civil-law system. The civil law systems are
usually based on civil codes, such as in Japan. The earliest of these
codes was the French Napoleonic Code of 1804.</p>
<p>In the common law and Roman law, there eventually evolved very
sophisticated bodies of legal principles, concepts, methodology, and
precedents. Because the classical common law and Roman law developed the
large bulk of their legal principles through the decision and discussion
of cases, they serve as rough examples of decentralized systems of
“judge-found” law, as do largely private customary law systems like the
Law Merchant.<a href="#fn572" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref572"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>572</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike Roman law and the common law, however, modern civil law
principles are embodied in a statute called a Civil Code, and the civil
law enshrines legislation as the primary source of law. <a href="#fn573"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref573" role="doc-noteref"><sup>573</sup></a>
In these systems, legal scientists elegantly codify the preceding body
of legal principles developed mostly in a decentralized fashion (via the
Roman law) and customary European law, but then the legislature enacts
this code as a statute and makes legislation the primary source of law.
The modern civil law is thus a good example of an explicitly centralized
legal system, even though much of the substantive provisions of civil
codes are based on legal principles discovered in decentralized fashion
in Rome many centuries ago. Roman law thus has more in common with the
common law and customary law than with the Roman law’s offspring, modern
civil law, since the former were decentralized law-finding systems,
while the latter are centralized, legislation-based law-<em>making</em>
systems.<a href="#fn574" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref574"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>574</sup></a> Today’s common law, while based on
the classical and mostly decentralized Anglo-American common law, is
also coming to be more and more dominated by legislation and, to that
extent, is gradually being centralized as well.</p>
<p>Thus, previously, law was thought of as a body of true principles
ripe for discovery by judges, not as whatever the legislator decreed.
Nowadays, however, legislation has become such a ubiquitous way of
making law that “the very idea that the law might not be identical with
legislation seems odd both to students of law and to laymen.”<a
href="#fn575" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref575"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>575</sup></a> And, one might add, to many
libertarians. As discussed below, however, a legislative system is
incompatible with libertarian principles and destroys true Law. This
holds true for all legislation-based legal systems, even civil law
systems, which typically embody fairly libertarian principles, much as
the original body of common law does. Although the civil codes of civil
law systems codify, in elegant form, principles developed in the
relatively decentralized Roman legal system, civil codes are still
merely statutes in a system in which legislation is the primary source
of law. Thus even civil codes, the most elegant and liberal exemplars of
centralized legislation, are subject to the general criticism of
legislation presented in this chapter.</p>
<h5 id="b.-civil-law-rationalism-and-libertarianism"><em>B. Civil Law,
Rationalism, and Libertarianism</em></h5>
<p>Before concluding this section and proceeding to general criticisms
of legislated law, I want to briefly note the tendency of civilians to
regard the civil law as a great “rationalist” system.<a href="#fn576"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref576" role="doc-noteref"><sup>576</sup></a>
Civilians consider modern civil law to be “rational” or even
“rationalistic” for various reasons, including the views that civil law:
is rationally and systematically codified,<a href="#fn577"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref577" role="doc-noteref"><sup>577</sup></a>
rather than “unscientifically” developed in an uncoordinated fashion by
decentralized judges; is “certain” and clear because the rules are
written;<a href="#fn578" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref578"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>578</sup></a> and is proclaimed by the
legislator. Civil law systems such as the Louisiana and French systems
are also praised as being drafted “in the spirit of the
Enlightenment,”<a href="#fn579" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref579"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>579</sup></a> and as resting on an ideological
commitment to democracy,<a href="#fn580" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref580" role="doc-noteref"><sup>580</sup></a> economic
liberalism,<a href="#fn581" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref581"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>581</sup></a> private property,<a href="#fn582"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref582" role="doc-noteref"><sup>582</sup></a>
freedom of contract,<a href="#fn583" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref583"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>583</sup></a> individualism,<a href="#fn584"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref584" role="doc-noteref"><sup>584</sup></a>
natural law,<a href="#fn585" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref585"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>585</sup></a> and justice.<a href="#fn586"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref586"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>586</sup></a></p>
<p>Most libertarians would agree that such virtues are genuinely
justifiable and thus ought to be supported by any legitimate legal
system. Moreover, civilians are also correct that these liberal
principles are consistent with rationalism, because libertarian
principles can also be justified with rationalist arguments.<a
href="#fn587" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref587"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>587</sup></a></p>
<p>Under the libertarian conception of individual rights, the virtues
typically cited in favor of the civil law are certainly necessary
requirements of a just legal system. The virtues of economic liberalism,
private property, freedom of contract, individualism, natural law, and
justice are really only secondary derivations of the basic individual
rights to person and property. Natural law is nothing more than the
objective truth that each individual has certain rights—i.e., to own
himself and to homestead unowned property or acquire it by contractual
transfer. Justice is nothing more than giving a person his due, but what
a person’s “due” is depends upon what his rights are.<a href="#fn588"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref588" role="doc-noteref"><sup>588</sup></a>
Individualism has meaning and validity, because it is
<em>individuals</em> that have rights. Economic liberalism, private
property, and freedom of contract are only the playing out of the fact
that individuals have a right to own, and thus trade, private property,
and indeed have a right to do <em>anything</em> that is not aggression.
Economic liberalism is only a consequence of the government’s lack of
authority to hamper free trade and association between individuals.<a
href="#fn589" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref589"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>589</sup></a></p>
<p>Any system of law must be compatible with the rights that individual
humans have, and, to that extent, law should be “certain”—that is, we
should be certain that law will protect our rights and will not infringe
them. The more general goal of “certainty” in the law is merely an
aspect of the rule of law, which is necessary for any civilization to
survive. Without certainty and the <em>rule of law</em>, individuals are
not able to predict the results of their actions and are thus unable to
rationally plan for the future.</p>
<p>In Part III, below, I argue that centralized legal systems like the
civil law and, increasingly, the legislation-dominated common law
systems are antithetical to the values of justice, natural law,
individual rights, and certainty. Civilians generally support these
values, yet they also support the idea of the primacy of legislation
which will tend to destroy these values. But how can the civil law be
the great system of reason and rationalism, how can it support economic
liberalism and individualism, if the civil law is based on legislation,
which undercuts these things? Although worshipers of legislation claim
to be rationalists, only a naive sort of rationalism, the same naivety
that is behind the desire of socialists to “scientifically” plan market
activity, can underlie such claims.<a href="#fn590" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref590" role="doc-noteref"><sup>590</sup></a></p>
<p>Civilians are correct that reason and even rationalism justify the
tenets of individualism, individual rights, economic liberalism, private
property, and natural law. Contrary to claims of civilians, however, it
is a completely private, decentralized law-finding system that is
compatible with and that fosters such virtues and principles. Therefore,
as will be shown, it is non-legislative, decentralized law-finding
systems that are imbued with the spirit of reason and true rationalism.
Legislation-based systems are not compatible with either libertarianism
or rationalism, or with our natural human rights.</p>
<h4 id="iii.-law-legislation-and-liberty">III. LAW, LEGISLATION, AND
LIBERTY</h4>
<p>In this Part, I explain the various reasons why legislation is
incompatible with individual rights and the related standards that any
valid legal order must uphold. Each criticism of legislation applies
equally to the civil law, because the civil law is a centralized (i.e.,
legislative) law-making system, and also applies to modern common law
systems to the extent that legislation has supplanted (decentralized)
case law as the primary source of law.</p>
<h5 id="a.-anarcho-capitalism"><em>A. Anarcho-Capitalism</em></h5>
<p>In the opinion of many libertarians, a principled and consistent
application of libertarian principles invalidates not only most of
today’s (legislated) laws, but also the state itself, since government
is an agency of institutionalized aggression.<a href="#fn591"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref591" role="doc-noteref"><sup>591</sup></a>
The state, by its mere existence, rests on aggression and necessarily
initiates violence against innocent individuals (e.g., taxation;
monopolizing law). The state cannot exist without aggression, and if
aggression is illegitimate, then so is the state.<a href="#fn592"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref592"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>592</sup></a></p>
<p>As most libertarians are aware, this view is known as
“anarcho-capitalism” or anarchist libertarianism, since this form of
anarchism follows from a respect for individual rights that are also a
feature of laissez faire capitalism. It almost goes without saying that,
if government may not exist, neither may legislation, because only a
governmental legislature can enact statutes. There is simply no room for
government and legislation in the moral universe. This does not mean,
however, that there would be no law if there were no government.
Certainly law can develop in a decentralized court system, whether a
government-based common-law system or a private system. As Rothbard
explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t is perfectly possible, in theory and historically,[<a
href="#fn593" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref593"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>593</sup></a>] to have efficient and courteous
police, competent and learned judges, and a body of systematic and
socially accepted law—and none of these things being furnished by a
coercive government.<a href="#fn594" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref594"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>594</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of this Part is devoted to additional critiques of
legislation that do not depend on anarcho-capitalism but only on the
general rights and principles accepted by libertarians in general. In
other words, one does not need to be an anarchist libertarian to oppose
legislation as a means of making, developing, or identifying law.</p>
<h5 id="b.-certainty"><em>B. Certainty</em></h5>
<h6 id="certainty-the-rule-of-law-and-legislation"><strong>1. Certainty,
the Rule of Law, and Legislation</strong></h6>
<p>Certainty, which includes clarity and stability in the law, is a
necessary feature of any just legal order, as it is a crucial component
of the rule of law itself. “The rule of law” is a phrase that is used
with varying meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the absence of arbitrary power on the part of the government to
punish citizens or to commit acts against life or property; (2) the
subjection of every man, whatever his rank or condition, to the ordinary
law of the realm and to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals; and
(3) a predominance of the legal spirit in English institutions….<a
href="#fn595" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref595"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>595</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rule of law is necessary because a government with arbitrary
power to inflict violence on its subjects is a standing threat to
individual liberty. And if laws are not equally applicable to all men
and women, some individual rights will not be respected, because all men
and women have certain inalienable, natural rights by their very nature
as humans. Clearly, then, the rule of law must be maintained by any just
legal system. But the rule of law “cannot be maintained without actually
securing the certainty of the law, conceived of as the possibility of
long-run planning on the part of individuals in regard to their behavior
in private life and business.”<a href="#fn596" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref596" role="doc-noteref"><sup>596</sup></a> Thus, a direct
implication of rationalism is that the law should be certain.</p>
<p>Even those favoring legislation recognize the importance of
certainty; indeed, certainty is one of the purported hallmarks of the
civil law. In the words of Professor Vernon Palmer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What enduring objectives underlie the relentless drive toward
codification in the twentieth century? In my view, this may be explained
in three words—certainty, justice, and modernity…. An unchanging purpose
of codification and recodification is to overcome an existing
fragmentation of law and legal sources in order to create the conditions
necessary for <em>legal certainty</em>.<a href="#fn597"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref597"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>597</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, as Leoni points out, there is much more certainty in a
decentralized legal system, than in a centralized legislative system.
When the legislature has the ability to change the law from day to day,
we can never be sure what rules will apply tomorrow.<a href="#fn598"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref598" role="doc-noteref"><sup>598</sup></a>
As Leoni observes, in a system of legislative supremacy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[N]obody can tell whether a rule may be only one year or one month or
one day old when it will be abrogated by a new rule. All these rules are
precisely worded in written formulae that readers or interpreters cannot
change at their will. Nevertheless, all of them may go as soon and as
abruptly as they came. The result is that, if we leave out of the
picture the ambiguities of the text, we are always “certain” as far as
the literal content of each rule is concerned at any given moment, but
we are <em>never certain</em> that tomorrow we shall still have the
rules we have today.<a href="#fn599" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref599"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>599</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] legal system centered on legislation, while involving the
possibility that other people (the legislators) may interfere with our
actions every day, also involves the possibility that they may change
their way of interfering every day. As a result, people are prevented
not only from freely deciding what to do, but from foreseeing the legal
effects of their daily behavior.<a href="#fn600" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref600" role="doc-noteref"><sup>600</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may have, then, either rule by legislators or the rule of law, but
not both.<a href="#fn601" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref601"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>601</sup></a> In the words of the Italian
scholar Giovanni Sartori, “Mass fabrication of laws ends by jeopardizing
the other fundamental requisite of law—certainty.”<a href="#fn602"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref602"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>602</sup></a></p>
<h6 id="decentralized-law-finding-systems"><strong>2. Decentralized
law-finding systems</strong></h6>
<p><em>a. Limits of Courts’ Decisions: Jurisdiction, Scope of Decision,
and Precedent</em></p>
<p>By contrast, judicial decisions—whether by private arbitrators in an
anarcho-capitalist society or by judges in a government-established
common-law system—are much less able to cause legal uncertainty than is
legislation. This is because, as Leoni explains, the position of
common-law or decentralized judges “is fundamentally different from that
of legislators, at least in three very important respects.”<a
href="#fn603" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref603"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>603</sup></a> First, judges can only make
decisions when asked to do so by the parties concerned. Second, the
judge’s decision is less far-reaching than legislation because it
primarily affects the parties to the dispute, and only occasionally
affects third parties or others with no connection to the parties
involved.<a href="#fn604" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref604"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>604</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding this second point, let me point out that this is true only
for the plaintiff, however, in systems where a verdict may be enforced
against a defendant regardless of his consent to the court’s
jurisdiction—i.e., where courts have compulsory jurisdiction over
certain individuals. But even this power is of a drastically lesser
scope than the ability of legislators to enact statutes at any time,
without being requested by anyone, and that affect everyone, not just
plaintiffs and defendants. Further, in a totally private court system,
courts do not necessarily have to have the ability to assert
jurisdiction over unwilling defendants.<a href="#fn605"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref605" role="doc-noteref"><sup>605</sup></a>
And even in a government court system such as the common law, it is not
absolutely necessary that the courts have compulsory jurisdiction over
unwilling participants. By contrast, legislation by its nature arrogates
to itself jurisdiction over all the government’s subjects.</p>
<p>Third, a judge’s discretion is further limited by the necessity of
referring to similar precedents.<a href="#fn606" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref606" role="doc-noteref"><sup>606</sup></a> This does not
necessarily mean that a judge is automatically bound by a prior judicial
decision on similar facts, but that at least such precedents are
influential. When law is viewed as being <em>found</em> rather than
<em>made</em>, it makes sense that one court would refer to principles
already discovered and developed over the centuries by other judges.
Because individuals crave certainty and predictability, they will tend
to prefer decisions of courts that respect the wisdom of established
custom and precedent, where possible. Thus, even a government court will
feel a necessity to refer to similar precedents, so that its judgments
and reasoning will be respected. A private court will have even more
incentive to respect relevant precedents so as to gain and retain
customers.</p>
<p>But a court’s essential job is to issue a just decision rather than
automatically following precedents through blind obedience. Indeed,
under the Roman law, and under the common law as it existed at the time
of Blackstone, an individual decision was not absolutely binding on
future courts.<a href="#fn607" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref607"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>607</sup></a> Even the great common-law advocate
“Blackstone was not a slavish adherent of the principle of <em>stare
decisis</em> (decision according to precedent)—a prior decision could be
overruled if ‘contrary to reason’….”<a href="#fn608"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref608" role="doc-noteref"><sup>608</sup></a>
But Blackstone did favor <em>stare decisis</em> as a means of
subordinating judges to law and for stability in the law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For it is an established rule to abide by former precedents, where
the same points come again in litigation: as well to keep the scale of
justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with every new judge’s
opinion; as also because the law in that case being solemnly declared
and determined, what before was uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, is
now become a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any
subsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private
sentiments….<a href="#fn609" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref609"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>609</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, the civilian concept of <em>jurisprudence
constante</em> is more likely to be adhered to by private courts than
<em>stare decisis</em>. (<em>Stare decisis</em> contemplates adherence
by a court to a principle of law announced and applied in a single
occasion in the past. Under the doctrine of <em>jurisprudence</em>
<em>constante</em>, the rule of law upon which repeated decisions in a
long line of cases is based is entitled to great weight in subsequent
decisions.<a href="#fn610" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref610"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>610</sup></a>) In any event, it is very likely
that judges will always attempt to distinguish or at least criticize
similar precedents even if they choose not to follow them.<a
href="#fn611" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref611"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>611</sup></a> As mentioned above, this will tend
to limit the judge’s discretion to “make” law.</p>
<p><em>b. Government Courts: Extra-Market Powers and Disguised
Legislation</em></p>
<p>Thus, decentralized law-finding systems offer more certainty than
centralized law-making systems. As the discussion above shows, however,
in a government-backed <em>common-law</em> type of decentralized system
(as opposed to a wholly private court system), the common law itself can
develop legislative characteristics that tend to undermine certainty
just as legislation does. This is because common-law courts are
government courts and thus have extra-market powers, such as the power
to subpoena, the power of compulsory jurisdiction over defendants, and
the power of judicial review.</p>
<p>Supreme courts, for example, may engage in what is really disguised
legislation. The United States Supreme Court does this all the time.<a
href="#fn612" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref612"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>612</sup></a> However, this is not a problem of
decentralized law itself, but of involving government in the court
system. Under anarcho-capitalism, with a system of totally private
courts and judges, these problems would be minimized as much as is
possible in the real world. And, as Leoni points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[E]ven supreme courts are not at all in the same practical position
as legislators. After all, not only the inferior courts, but also the
supreme courts, may issue decisions only if asked to do so by the
parties concerned; and although supreme courts are in this respect in a
different position from inferior courts, they are still bound to
“interpret” the law instead of promulgating it…. [Further,] under a
system of “binding” precedent, supreme courts too may be bound … by
their own precedents…. [T]his makes for a considerable difference
between judges of supreme courts and legislators as far as the unwelcome
imposition of their respective wills on a possibly great number of other
dissenting people is concerned.<a href="#fn613" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref613" role="doc-noteref"><sup>613</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, even under a government-based decentralized legal system such
as the common law, judges’ ability to “legislate” is radically different
from that of legislators. The possibility of judges acting like
legislators is not necessarily implied in the nature of decentralized
law-finding systems, but “is rather a deviation from it and a somewhat
contradictory introduction of the legislative process under the
deceptive label of lawyers’ or judiciary law at its highest stage.”<a
href="#fn614" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref614"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>614</sup></a></p>
<p>Although law developed in a decentralized legal order is an
“unplanned,” spontaneous order, it results in certainty, while a
centralized legal system tends to destroy certainty. In a decentralized
legal system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Law develops in a case by case manner during which judges fit and
adapt existing law to circumstances so as to produce an overall order
which, although it may not be “efficient” in a technical, rationalistic
sense, … is more stable than that created by statute…. [S]tatute law is
in fact much more capricious [than common law] precisely because, in the
modern world especially, statutes change frequently according to the
whims of legislatures…. <em>A structure of law which is not the result
of will and cannot be known in its entirety, paradoxically, displays
more regularities than a written code.</em><a href="#fn615"

<h6 id="civil-codes"><strong>3. Civil Codes</strong></h6>
<p class="heading" id="a.-the-special-status-of-a-civil-code"><em>a. The
“Special” Status of a Civil Code</em></p>
<p>Can legislation be made more stable so that it does not engender
uncertainty? Written constitutions such as the United States
Constitution are, after all, difficult to explicitly amend,<a
href="#fn616" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref616"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>616</sup></a> although the Supreme Court has
amended the Constitution <em>de facto</em> hundreds of times.<a
href="#fn617" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref617"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>617</sup></a> The more stable a written statute
is, however, the less it resembles legislation, and vice-versa.
Civilians contend that the civil law’s core is the civil code, which is
not meant to change on a daily basis. Rather, a code is more like a
constitution, which changes only rarely, in response to greater urgency.
The code is not a normal sort of legislation; it is more stable than
legislation, and therefore is not subject to the criticism that it
engenders uncertainty in the same way as does a mere legislative
system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C]odification has for its object the creation of a permanent
framework and direction of the evolution of the law. It has a
prospective life, and it is not limited to a short-lived or cyclical
legislation…. [C]odification is to be contrasted with simple legislation
tailored to the circumstances.<a href="#fn618" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref618" role="doc-noteref"><sup>618</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A civil code is more like a constitution than mere legislation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a commonplace that a civil code enjoys a more exalted status
than an ordinary statute. The higher dignity accorded to a code is
traditional in the civil law world. This respect is due originally to
the special qualities of the legislation—its relative permanence,
imposing structure, and inner coherence. Statutes may be ad hoc,
scattered, and temporary, but the civil code in our tradition has
attained something close to the stature enjoyed by a constitution or a
Magna Carta in the common-law world.<a href="#fn619"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref619"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>619</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, such flattery cannot change the fact that the civil code
itself provides that legislation is the primary source of law. It does
not provide that <em>codal</em> legislation, which conforms to certain
code-like requirements (e.g., generality, natural law, and the like), is
the only source of law. It does not abolish mere statutes and does not
take precedence over any subsequently-enacted conflicting statutes, as
the U.S. Constitution does; and neither does it provide for a
supermajority requirement for its amendment. From a legislator’s point
of view, the civil code and more mundane legislation are on the exact
same horizontal level. (Moreover, even a higher piece of legislation
like the U.S. Constitution is still just legislation: written decrees
announced by a government committee and enforced by the state, whether
just or not.)</p>
<p>Thus the code itself is subject to continual revision and, indeed, is
continually revised. It may not in practice be revised as drastically or
as often as the other statutes, but the legislature retains the ability
to change the code from day to day. For, “a code is a special kind of
statute, but a statute nevertheless.”<a href="#fn620"

role="doc-noteref"><sup>620</sup></a></p>
<p class="heading" id="b.-diluting-effect-of-special-statutes"><em>b.
Diluting Effect of Special Statutes</em></p>
<p>What is worse, even if the civil code itself were to be immutably
etched in stone—and civil codes are, admittedly, amended much less
frequently in some regimes than are “normal” statutes—it would tend to
be swamped by subsequent special statutes. Civilians do not disagree
with this point. Once a code has been produced and the laws codified, as
Professor Palmer recognizes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fragmentation continues inexorably. Special legislation lying outside
of the code piles up on all sides, as caselaw and jurisprudence create a
thicker and thicker gloss upon the code texts….[T]his inflation of
redundant and overlapping laws … is the true enemy of a scientific
codification and <em>the true nemesis of legal certainty</em>.<a
href="#fn621" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref621"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>621</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inexorable production of specialized legislation thus dilutes any
stabilizing effect of a civil code and makes the code less relevant.
Given the unwieldy hodge-podge of arcane, special-interest statutes that
we are faced with today, is it any wonder that uncertainty—both in what
the law is today and in what it might be tomorrow—is engendered? Yet we
would not have reached such a chaotic state if not for the legislature’s
ability to enact its will into law.</p>
<h6 id="negative-effects-of-uncertainty"><strong>4. Negative Effects of
Uncertainty</strong></h6>
<p class="heading" id="a.-sanctity-of-contract"><em>a. Sanctity of
Contract</em></p>
<p>As discussed above,<a href="#fn622" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref622" role="doc-noteref"><sup>622</sup></a> without certainty of
the law, individuals are less able to make long-range plans. The
uncertainty resulting from legislative supremacy also has the negative
side effect of weakening the sanctity of contract. Legislation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…destroy[s] established rules and [nullifies] existing conventions
and agreements that have hitherto been voluntarily accepted and kept.
Even more disruptive is the fact that the very possibility of nullifying
agreements and conventions through supervening legislation tends in the
long run to induce people to fail to rely on any existing conventions or
to keep any accepted agreements.<a href="#fn623" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref623" role="doc-noteref"><sup>623</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When legislation becomes supreme and statutes are fruitful and
multiply, our very conception of what the law is changes. Unlike in the
past, “we are used to having our rights modified by the sovereign
decisions of legislators. A landlord no longer feels surprised at being
compelled to keep a tenant; an employer is no less used to having to
raise the wages of his employees in virtue of the decrees of Power.
Nowadays it is understood that our subjective rights are precarious and
at the good pleasure of authority.”<a href="#fn624" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref624" role="doc-noteref"><sup>624</sup></a></p>
<p>When contractual reliance becomes more risky, “contractual exchanges
requiring temporally separated future performance become less
attractive, leading the parties to develop costly alternatives, such as
contractual hostages (if that is possible at all under the statute),
otherwise unwarranted vertical integration of production processes, or
the foregoing of such exchanges entirely.”<a href="#fn625"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref625" role="doc-noteref"><sup>625</sup></a>
Such alternatives impoverish us all by imposing unnecessary costs on
production and exchange.</p>
<p class="heading"
id="b.-time-preference-and-the-structure-of-production"><em>b. Time
Preference and the Structure of Production</em></p>
<p>Another extremely pernicious but subtle effect of the increased
uncertainty of legislative systems is the increase of man’s time
preference. Individuals invariably demonstrate a preference for earlier
goods over later goods, all things being equal. This is the phenomenon
of time preference.<a href="#fn626" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref626"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>626</sup></a> Time preference explains the
advent of interest payments, payments made to someone who loans money.
When a loan of money is made, the lender gives up (more-valued) present
dollars and receives (less-valued) future dollars, and thus the loan
will go forward only if the lender is compensated with interest.</p>
<p>Men prosper materially when time preferences are lower, since when
this is the case, they are more willing to forego immediate benefits
such as consumption and invest their time and capital in more indirect
(i.e., more roundabout, lengthier) production processes, which yield
more and/or better goods for consumption or for further production.<a
href="#fn627" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref627"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>627</sup></a> We forego picking bananas to eat
them now (consumption) and devote some of our present time to the
building of fishing nets (capital) so we can catch more fish in the
future, which can feed more people for the same amount of work as it
took to search for bananas.</p>
<p>Any artificial raising of the general time preference rate tends to
impoverish society by pushing us away from production, long-term
investments, and roundabout production processes and towards consumption
and more short-term investments which produce fewer and/or worse quality
goods. In other words, instead of foregoing picking bananas to eat them
now and instead of spending time building fishing nets to produce goods
in the future, we tend to eat more bananas now and live only for the
moment, and reduce our investment in the future. Clearly, when the
general time preference rate is artificially raised, the populace
becomes materially poorer and worse off.</p>
<p><em>Yet increased uncertainty causes an increase in time preference
rates.</em> With the very possibility of legislation, the future is made
more unpredictable than it would be without the possibility of
legislation. Future goods are always less desirable to individuals than
present goods. But if the future becomes more unpredictable, future
actions and goods become less certain to occur, and thus future goods
become relatively even <em>less</em> desirable, and present goods
therefore become relatively more desirable. As explained by Hoppe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he mere fact of legislation—of democratic law-making—increases the
degree of uncertainty. Rather than being immutable and hence
predictable, law becomes increasingly flexible and unpredictable. What
is right and wrong today may not be so tomorrow. The future is thus
rendered more haphazard. Consequently, all around time preferences
degrees will rise, consumption and short-term orientation will be
stimulated, and at the same time the respect for all laws will be
systematically undermined and crime promoted (for if there is no
immutable standard of “right,” then there is also no firm definition of
“crime”).<a href="#fn628" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref628"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>628</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leoni anticipated a similar effect of legislation. Leoni called the
illusory certainty generated by written legislation the short-run
certainty of the law, as opposed to genuine, long-run legal certainty.
The desire for short-run certainty over long-run certainty corresponds
to an immature desire for immediate gratification. Leoni writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am reminded of a conversation I had with an old man who grew plants
in my country. I asked him to sell me a big tree for my private garden.
He replied, “Everybody now wants big trees. People want them
immediately; they do not bother about the fact that trees grow slowly
and that it takes a great deal of time and trouble to grow them.
Everybody today is always in a hurry,” he sadly concluded, “and I do not
know why.” <a href="#fn629" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref629"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>629</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is, in part, because an increased climate of uncertainty
increases the general time preference rate.</p>
<p class="heading" id="c.-time-preference-and-crime"><em>c. Time
Preference and Crime</em></p>
<p>There is also a fascinating relationship, as Hoppe above alludes to,
between higher time preference and increased crime. This is because
earning a market income requires more patience than does the immediate
gratification that criminals seek: “one must first work for a while
before one gets paid. In contrast, specific criminal activities such as
murder, assault, rape, robbery, theft, and burglary require no such
discipline: the reward for the aggressor is tangible and immediate
whereas the sacrifice—possible punishment—lies in the future and is
uncertain.”<a href="#fn630" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref630"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>630</sup></a> As a person becomes more
present-oriented, immediate (criminal) gratifications become relatively
more attractive, and future, uncertain punishment becomes less of a
disincentive. Thus many people on the margin—those who are just deterred
from committing crimes by the threat of possible future punishment under
normal time-preference conditions in a free society—will not be deterred
from committing crimes in a society with legislation and its concomitant
increase in time preference. In other words, there are individuals today
who are committing violent crimes solely because of the increased
uncertainty in society caused by the existence of legislation.<a
href="#fn631" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref631"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>631</sup></a> Further, when the increased
uncertainty tends to impoverish us by shortening the structure of
production, more people are poor and impoverished, which also tends to
increase the amount of crime in society.</p>
<p>When law is based on legislation, uncertainty is increased, not
decreased, even in the supposedly “certain” civil law systems. This
hampers the ability of individuals to engage in private calculation,
i.e., in planning for the future and in knowing the legal consequences
of their future actions. It makes contractual reliance more risky and
thus imposes further costs on otherwise-beneficial economic
transactions. And the unavoidable uncertainty caused by legislation also
raises our time preference rate, which “necessarily exerts a push away
from more highly capitalized, and hence more productive production
processes, and into the direction of a hand-to-mouth existence,”<a

<p>Introductory Note: In this section (Part III.C), I relied heavily on
Bruno Leoni’s interpretation of Mises’s and Hayek’s views on the
economic calculation problem and his related criticism of legislation by
analogy to central economic planning. Subsequently, I gained a deeper
understanding of the difference between Mises’s and Hayek’s approach to
this issue, after Joseph Salerno initiated the “dehomogenization”
debate.<a href="#fn633" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref633"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>633</sup></a> At the time I wrote the original

reliance on Hayek to criticize legislation, when he analogizes the
problems of legislation to the economic calculation problem faced by a
central economic planner, because Hayek’s own approach to the
calculation problem and his focus on “knowledge” is flawed. By the time
I wrote the article which would become chapter 17 of this volume, in
1999, I had realized my error, and discussed the flaws with the Hayekian
approach in the section “Knowledge vs. Calculation.” In sum, as several
Misesian Austrians have pointed out:</p>
<p>Rothbard: “the entire Hayekian emphasis on ‘knowledge’ is misplaced
and misconceived”</p>
<p>Hülsmann: discussing “the irrelevance of knowledge problems”</p>
<p>Salerno: “[t]he price system is not–and praxeologically cannot be—a
mechanism for economizing and communicating the knowledge relevant to

<p>Besides the fact that the possibility of legislation breeds
uncertainty and is thus harmful for this reason alone, legislators face
a problem that central economic planners also face. It is an information
problem, and this unavoidable problem makes it unlikely that any body of
legislation will develop substantively legitimate law—i.e., a body of
law consistent with principles such as justice, individualism, and
economic liberalism. For the same reason that central economic planning
is impossible, centrally-planned laws cannot hope to be truly based on
the true interests or needs or situation of the populace. I first
discuss the reason why central planning—i.e., socialism—is impossible,
before analogizing socialism to legislation.</p>
<h6 id="central-planning-and-the-impossibility-of-socialism"><strong>1.
Central Planning and the Impossibility of Socialism</strong></h6>
<p>With the collapse of communism/socialism, mainstream opinion is
finally starting to realize that socialism, in addition to being
incredibly immoral and wasteful of human life, simply does not work. But
this comes as no revelation and no surprise to the Austrian school of
economics following in the footsteps of Ludwig von Mises. As far back as
1920, Mises explained why socialism is <em>impossible</em>. Although
Mises’s amazingly prescient ideas were arrogantly and unfortunately
ignored for decades by establishment thinkers, Mises has finally been
vindicated by the universally (if belatedly) acknowledged failure of
socialism,<a href="#fn636" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref636"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>636</sup></a> and I will not re-argue the
obvious here, especially in a libertarian journal.</p>
<p>However, Mises’s explanation of why socialist central planning is
doomed to failure has, as pointed out by Leoni, important ramifications
for <em>legislation</em> as well. Thus, in this subsection I briefly
discuss the so-called “economic calculation debate” before exploring its
implications for legislation.</p>
<p>In 1920 Mises published his devastating critique of socialism,
“Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth.”<a href="#fn637"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref637" role="doc-noteref"><sup>637</sup></a>
Mises showed that, besides the incentive problem of socialism (e.g.,
“Who will take out the garbage?”),<a href="#fn638" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref638" role="doc-noteref"><sup>638</sup></a> the central planner
cannot know what products or how much of them to order to be produced
without the information provided by prices on a free market. In a free
market, in which there is by definition private ownership of property,
the free exchange of goods by individual human actors in accordance with
their subjective utilities establishes relative prices, in terms of
money (which historically was gold and other precious metals). These
money prices are the indispensable tool of calculation for rational
coordination of scarce resources, since “monetary economic calculation
is the intellectual basis of the market economy.”<a href="#fn639"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref639" role="doc-noteref"><sup>639</sup></a>
Without market prices, how can a central planning board know what or how
many products to produce, with which techniques and raw materials, and
in which location? These and a practically infinite number of questions
are simply unanswerable without the information provided by monetary
prices. As Rothbard explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mises demonstrated that, in any economy more complex than the Crusoe
or primitive family level, the socialist planning board would simply not
know what to do, or how to answer any of these vital questions.
Developing the momentous concept of <em>calculation</em>, Mises pointed
out that the planning board could not answer these questions because
socialism would lack the indispensable tool that private entrepreneurs
use to appraise and calculate: the existence of a market in the means of
production, a market that brings about money prices based on genuine
profit-seeking exchanges by private owners of these means of production.
Since the very essence of socialism is collective ownership of the means
of production, the planning board would not be able to plan, or to make
any sort of rational economic decisions. Its decisions would necessarily
be completely arbitrary and chaotic, and therefore the existence of a
socialist planned economy is literally “impossible” (to use a term long
ridiculed by Mises’s critics).<a href="#fn640" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref640" role="doc-noteref"><sup>640</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defenders of socialism often countered with the bare fact of the
Soviet Union’s existence and “success” as disproof of the contention
that socialism is impossible. However, as Rothbard points out, Soviet
GNP and other production figures relied upon as evidence of the USSR’s
success were wholly inaccurate and deceitful—as the final collapse of
socialism has made manifest. Further, the Soviet Union and other
socialist countries have never enjoyed complete socialism, for despite
their best efforts to stamp out individual initiative, free trade, and
private property, the existence of black (i.e., free) markets and
bribery is widespread, which prevent socialism from completely
controlling and thus strangling the economy.</p>
<p>Also, these socialist economies existed in a world containing many
(relatively) capitalist markets, such as that in the United States.
Thus, the socialist planners were able to parasitically copy the prices
of the West as a crude guideline for pricing and allocating their own
capital resources.<a href="#fn641" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref641"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>641</sup></a> To the extent true socialism was
able to be imposed on the populace, economic calculation thereunder was
impossible and the people suffered accordingly.</p>
<p>In the words of Mises, “Where there is no market there is no price
system, and where there is no price system there can be no economic
calculation.”<a href="#fn642" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref642"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>642</sup></a> “The paradox of ‘planning’ is that
it cannot plan, because of the absence of economic calculation. What is

<h6 id="legislation-as-central-planning"><strong>2. Legislation as
Central Planning</strong></h6>
<p>One of Bruno Leoni’s greatest achievements was to teach us that
Mises’s criticism applies not only to a central planning board of a
socialist economy, but also to a legislature attempting to “centrally
plan” the laws of a society. Leoni notes that several economists in the
early ’20s, but especially Mises, demonstrated “that a centralized
economy run by<br />
a committee of directors suppressing market prices and proceeding
without them does not work because the directors cannot know, without
the continuous revelation of the market, what the demand or the supply
would be….”<a href="#fn644" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref644"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>644</sup></a> Leoni recognized that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…this demonstration may be deemed the most important and lasting
contribution made by the economists to the cause of individual freedom
in our time. <em>However, its conclusions may be considered only as a
special</em> <em>case of a more general realization that no legislator
would be able to establish by himself, without some kind of continuous
collaboration on the part of all the people concerned, the rules
governing the actual behavior of everybody in the endless relationships
that each has with everybody else.</em> No public opinion polls, no
referenda, no consultations would really put the legislators in a
position to determine these rules, any more than a similar procedure
could put the directors of a planned economy in a position to discover
the total demand and supply of all commodities and services.<a

<p>What does this mean? Leoni is pointing out that legislators, even if
they wanted to enact rules that truly take into account the actual
situation, customs, expectations, and practices of individuals, simply
can never collect enough information about the near-infinite variety of
human interactions. The legislator, like a communist central planner,
can only grope in the dark. And unlike a blind man who literally has to
grope in the dark but at least knows when he has finally run into a wall
or found the door, the legislator (or central planner) has no reliable
guide for knowing whether they have constructed the “right” law (or
economic allocation) or not. Further, not only can legislators not know
the actual situation of the individuals they intend to cast their
legislative net over, but they cannot predict the often far-reaching
effects of legislation. Legislation routinely has unintended
consequences, a fact that cannot be gotten around since it is
necessitated by the systematic ignorance that legislators face.<a
href="#fn646" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref646"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>646</sup></a></p>
<p>The ultimate reason that the legislator and central planner are both
ultimately doomed to failure is that “<em>there is more than an analogy
between the market economy and a judiciary or lawyers’ law, just as
there is much more than an analogy between a planned economy and
legislation.</em>”<a href="#fn647" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref647"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>647</sup></a> There is “more” than an analogy
because legislation and central planning are really the same thing:
coercively-backed commands emanating from the government that order
individuals to act in certain ways that the government prefers.</p>
<p>In a common-law process, law develops spontaneously, much as prices
arise spontaneously on a free market. Mises showed that only when
individuals remain free to trade and own private property can genuine
prices be discovered. Similarly, true law is discovered in a process
that “can be described as sort of a vast, continuous, and chiefly
spontaneous collaboration between the judges and the judged in order to
discover what the people’s will is in a series of definite instances—a
collaboration that in many respects may be compared to that existing
among all the participants in a free market.”<a href="#fn648"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref648" role="doc-noteref"><sup>648</sup></a>
True law cannot be designed or imposed top-down on society. The form of
a legal system, like a price structure or like a language, must evolve
naturally, from the bottom up. This is why the artificial language
Esperanto failed to take hold.<a href="#fn649" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref649" role="doc-noteref"><sup>649</sup></a> The naive belief
that Law can be discovered by means of government employees’ dictates is
reminiscent of the joke about the new English public school, in which
the headmaster announced to the students one day, “from now on, it will
be a tradition at the School to wear hats on Fridays.” Legislation is
artificial law and is no substitute for evolved law.</p>
<p>A crucial reason for the systematic ignorance of central planners and
legislators alike is “the decentralized, fragmentary character of
knowledge.”<a href="#fn650" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref650"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>650</sup></a> This makes central planners and
central law-makers systematically unable to ever have enough knowledge
to make informed decisions that affect entire economic or legal systems.
Moreover, not only is a central planner “unable” to gather information
only present in a dynamic price structure, but the attempt to plan
actually <em>destroys</em> the price structure because the private
property system at the base of a price structure is outlawed. Similarly,
not only does a legislator face a severe ignorance problem—he could
never hope to have a comprehensive and continually updated view of all
the interactions, rules, relationships, and customs that exist among the
people—he also subverts the very spontaneous legal order that would form
in the absence of legislative interference. Customs change, for example,
because of the uncertainty introduced, because people become more
suspicious and rely less on contracts, and because their time preference
increases, as discussed above.<a href="#fn651" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref651" role="doc-noteref"><sup>651</sup></a> As Professor Aranson
puts it, “Legislation saps the social order of spontaneity.”<a
href="#fn652" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref652"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>652</sup></a></p>
<p>Just as a decentralized, free market economy is essential to the
coordination of resources and the production of wealth, so a
decentralized law-finding system is a prerequisite to allowing true law
to develop. This does not guarantee that the law will be just—there are
no guarantees—but at least it is possible in a decentralized law-finding
system, while in a legislated system it is not.</p>

Special Interests and the Unrepresentative Character of
Legislation</strong></h6>
<p>A problem of a legislative system that is related to the central
planning problem is its unrepresentative character. Although democracy
is not without problems,<a href="#fn653" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref653" role="doc-noteref"><sup>653</sup></a> a representative
democracy is better than one that is not. Because of the information
problem faced by centralized law-makers, they cannot know the people’s
wishes with any accuracy or detail. “<em>[A] legal system centered on
legislation resembles … a centralized economy in which all the relevant
decisions are made by a handful of directors, whose knowledge of the
whole situation is fatally limited and whose respect, if any, for the
people’s wishes is subject to that limitation.</em>”<a href="#fn654"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref654"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>654</sup></a></p>
<p>Italian legal scholar Giovanni Sartori puts the point forcefully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e make the inference that when a person who allegedly represents
some tens of thousands contributes … to the lawmaking process, then he
is making the thousands of people whom he is representing free, because
the represented thereby obey norms that they have freely chosen…. How
absurd! … In empirical terms, from the premise that I know how to swim
it may follow that I can cross a river, but not that I can cross the
ocean.<a href="#fn655" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref655"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>655</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, even if citizen involvement and participation in a small
community can produce liberty, “we cannot draw the conclusion that the
same amount of participation will produce the same result in a large
community; for in the latter an equally intense participation will
entail diminishing consequences.”<a href="#fn656" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref656" role="doc-noteref"><sup>656</sup></a> Leoni argues that
“the more numerous the people are whom one tries to ‘represent’ through
the legislative process and the more numerous the matters in which one
tries to represent them, the less the word ‘representation’ has a
meaning referable to the actual will of actual people other than that of
the persons named as their ‘representatives.’”<a href="#fn657"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref657"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>657</sup></a></p>
<p>Legislators cannot discover the will of their constituents, and, as
explained above,<a href="#fn658" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref658"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>658</sup></a> cannot know very much at all about
the actual interactions and circumstances of those who they seek to
regulate. At best, then, a legislator will produce rather neutral, if
bumbling, intrusive, and ineffectual, laws. But we all know about
lobbyists and special interest groups, and their existence ensures that
legislators will not be merely ignorant idiots. Instead, they will
actively seek to enact invidious statutes that benefit a select few at
the expense of others and, in the long run, at the expense of all of
society.</p>
<p>In the political process, statutes are enacted that reflect the will
of a contingent majority of legislators. This provides an opportunity
for various groups to demand special treatment, such as protectionism or
blatant wealth transfers. Those with a vested interest in a given piece
of legislation are willing to invest much time, effort, and money (e.g.
for bribes) to persuade legislators to enact the legislation. Each
individual in the large group outside the special interest group feels
the pain of the legislation much less than the special interest group
will benefit, so that there is relatively little incentive for many
people to oppose the special group’s lobbying efforts, or even to
educate themselves as to which lobbying efforts are taking place.
Escalating efforts at forming special interest groups to lobby for
specialized statutes results in “nothing less than a potential <em>legal
war of all against all</em>, carried on by way of legislation and
representation.”<a href="#fn659" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref659"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>659</sup></a> Any legislative system in a large,
modern society is doomed to succumb, to a large extent, to special
interest groups rather than representing the general will of the
populace.</p>
<h6 id="decentralized-law-finding-systems-1"><strong>4. Decentralized
Law-Finding Systems</strong></h6>
<p>As discussed above, legislative systems such as the civil law are
centralized law-making systems and face many of the problems faced by
central planners in general. Decentralized law-finding systems like the
common law, on the other hand, are analogous to free markets in that a
spontaneous order arises in both.<a href="#fn660" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref660" role="doc-noteref"><sup>660</sup></a> Unlike a legislator
imposing his will on society, when a judge decides a case he attempts
“to discover and make explicit the rule that is implicit in the
practices, customs, and institutions of the people…. Law then develops
through the application of the rule to new situations.”<a href="#fn661"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref661" role="doc-noteref"><sup>661</sup></a>
But as Liggio and Palmer note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This process reveals another analogy with the decentralized market
process, for the decision of a judge in a particular case is subject to
review by other participants in the legal process. One judge cannot
impose his personal will or idiosyncratic interpretation of the law on
the entire legal system; similarly, innovations in the market process
arise through the decentralized activities of entrepreneurs and firms
and are then subject to the review of consumers, investors, and other
market participants. In both the market process and the common law
process there is little danger of having “all your eggs in one basket,”
as is the case with both socialism and legislation.<a href="#fn662"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref662"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>662</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judges in a decentralized law-finding system are also less likely to
be influenced by special interests than are legislators. Professor
Epstein argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that structural features limit what the manipulation of common law
rules can achieve. The more focused and sustained methods of legislation
and regulation are apt to have more dramatic effects than does
alteration of common law rules and thus will attract the primary efforts
of those trying to use the law to promote their own interests.<a
href="#fn663" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref663"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>663</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the extent a court-based legal system displays legislative
characteristics, which often occurs in government-based court systems,<a
href="#fn664" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref664"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>664</sup></a> it faces the same central planning
problems as does legislation.<a href="#fn665" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref665" role="doc-noteref"><sup>665</sup></a> For example, judges
that attempt in their decisions to “maximize society’s wealth” <a
href="#fn666" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref666"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>666</sup></a> face the same information problems
as a central economic planner.<a href="#fn667" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref667" role="doc-noteref"><sup>667</sup></a></p>
<p>Judges, then, especially government-employed judges, can run into the
legislator’s ignorance problem when they act like legislators and
pretend they are omniscient.</p>
<h5 id="d.-the-proliferation-of-laws"><em>D. The Proliferation of
Laws</em></h5>
<p>Legislation is nothing more than controls, and it is evident that
controls breed yet more controls. And invariably, because of government
propaganda combined with public ignorance, the inevitable failures of
the nostrum of legislation are blamed, not on the interventionist
government, but on freedom and unregulated human conduct. Thus even more
controls are imposed to solve problems caused by controls in the first
place, and the process accelerates. For example, the well-known
boom-bust business cycle, with its recurrent depressions and recessions
(such as the Great Depression and recent recessions), is caused not by
capitalism but by government manipulation of the money supply (which is,
of course, only possible with legislatively-created institutions such as
the Federal Reserve).<a href="#fn668" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref668"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>668</sup></a> When such government-caused
calamities strike, the current Roosevelt or Clinton milks the disaster
as an excuse for more government intervention and power.<a href="#fn669"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref669" role="doc-noteref"><sup>669</sup></a>
Thus, legislation has a ratcheting effect whereby statutes tend to lead
to further statutes, and the government sphere expands outward as these
statutes cascade down from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Such a continual outpouring of laws has many insidious effects. As
has wisely been said, “The more corrupt the Republic, the more the
laws.”<a href="#fn670" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref670"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>670</sup></a> But the reverse is also true. As
special interest groups become successful, others become necessary for
self-defense, and soon a legal war of all against all begins to emerge,
as already discussed.<a href="#fn671" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref671"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>671</sup></a> The ability<br />
of legislators to change laws reduces legal certainty, which makes
contractual reliance more risky and hampers useful economic
transactions. Uncertainty also increases the general time preference
rate, which shortens the structure of production, thereby impoverishing
society. The ensuing higher time preference also increases the
prevalence of criminal activity.<a href="#fn672" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref672" role="doc-noteref"><sup>672</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, when so many laws exist, and with such arcane, vague,
complex language, it becomes almost impossible for each citizen to avoid
being a law-breaker, especially when we have the perverse rule that
“ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Even government officials cannot
seem to obey federal tax laws regarding household help. Almost everyone
has violated a tax law, securities regulation, “racketeering” law, drug
law, handgun law, alcohol law, customs regulation, anti-sodomy law, or
at least traffic ordinance.<a href="#fn673" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref673" role="doc-noteref"><sup>673</sup></a> But when we are all
law-breakers the law is discredited<a href="#fn674" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref674" role="doc-noteref"><sup>674</sup></a> and, what is worse,
the government can selectively and arbitrarily enforce whatever law is
convenient against whichever “trouble-maker” it wishes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, “the legislative conception of law accustoms those to
whom the norms are addressed to accept any and all commands of the
State, that is, to accept any <em>iussum</em> as <em>ius</em>.”<a
href="#fn675" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref675"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>675</sup></a> People become more accustomed to
following orders, and thus become more docile, servile, and less
independent. Once people become docile and lose their rebellious spirit,
“[t]he road is cleared for the legal suppression of constitutional
legality. Whoever has had the experience of observing, for example, how
fascism established itself in power knows how easily the existing
juridical order can be manipulated to serve the ends of a dictatorship
without the country’s being really aware of the break.”<a href="#fn676"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref676"

<p>Legal inflation cheapens and dilutes law, just as money inflation by
the Federal Reserve dilutes dollars and causes price inflation. True law
becomes smothered by legislation.</p>
<h4 id="iv.-naive-rationalism-and-the-primacy-of-legislation">IV. NAIVE
RATIONALISM AND THE PRIMACY OF LEGISLATION</h4>
<p>If the arguments made herein are correct, no centralized legal system
can be a rationalist system, because legislation undermines the
rationalist, libertarian virtues of individualism, individual liberty,
and the rule of law. Why, then, is the civil law proclaimed as the great
rationalist legal system, even though it sets up legislation as the
primary source of law? Why are legislation and codification hailed as
superior, scientific, and rational? Why, for that matter, is legislation
so popular today even in common-law regimes, as well as in our federal
system? It seems somewhat strange that those who support individual
liberty, justice, and the rule of law would also support the very thing
that opposes and erodes these things.</p>
<p>In Hayek’s view, there are two types of rationalism: evolutionary
rationalism (or, in Karl Popper’s terminology, critical rationalism) and
constructivist rationalism (Popper’s naive rationalism).<a href="#fn677"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref677" role="doc-noteref"><sup>677</sup></a>
Each of these two variants of rationalism is associated with a unique
view of liberty. Critical rationalism, i.e., true rationalism, relates
to a “British” theory of liberty that derives from thinkers such as
Locke, Hume, Smith, Burke, Montesquieu, de Tocqueville, and Lord Acton,
while the “French” version of rationalism, i.e., naive rationalism,
derives from Rousseau, Condorcet, Hobbes, and Descartes.<a href="#fn678"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref678" role="doc-noteref"><sup>678</sup></a>
Hayek believed that “all modern socialism, planning and totalitarianism
derive” from the naive rationalism of the French tradition.<a
href="#fn679" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref679"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>679</sup></a></p>
<p>Like the socialists who naively believe that the delicate order of
the market, coordinated by millions of individual interactions, can be
replaced by the brute force of a central planning board, naive
rationalists have an almost superstitious faith in the ability of reason
to impose law on society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Hayek’s view, the decisive influence on the French Enlightenment
political theory was the philosophy of Descartes, with its extravagant
assumptions about the powers of human reason. Cartesian [i.e., naive]
rationalism lead to the belief that everything which men achieve,
including liberty, is the direct result of reason and therefore should
be subject to its control. It traced all order to deliberate human
design and expressed contempt for institutions that were not consciously
designed or not intelligible to reason.<a href="#fn680"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref680"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>680</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But naive rationalists fail to appreciate the true role of
spontaneous order in human society. Because they did not understand, for
example, that resources are allocated rationally only in a decentralized
free market, a free market appears chaotic and unruly, as something that
should be tamed and replaced with “scientific” central planning.</p>
<p>The belief of civilians and other proponents of centralized
law-making that true law ever could be made by a legislature stems from
a naive rationalism because it assigns too broad a role to deductive
reason. This is not surprising, given the French influence on the
development of modern civil law. Reason is our only means of knowledge,
but we would not attempt, for example, to take a sick person’s
temperature by closing our eyes and deducing it. Instead, we would
measure it, if we realized that a pure exercise of deductive thinking
cannot hope to give us this information.<a href="#fn681"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref681" role="doc-noteref"><sup>681</sup></a>
This would be naive.<a href="#fn682" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref682"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>682</sup></a></p>
<p>A genuine market order can only be generated from the bottom up by
the free interaction of private property owners. Given this fact, it is
rational not to destroy this order by the top-down commands issued by a
sovereign central planner. A detailed body of law, while based on
fundamental norms established by and compatible with true rationalism,
can only be discovered and established in a decentralized fashion; and
it is clear that centralized legislative commands can only disrupt and
distort the spontaneous and rational development of Law. The championing
of legislation, not to mention central economic planning, thus
irrationally ignores the reality that Law is compatible only with a
decentralized law-finding system, and it ignores the inevitable negative
effects of attempting to legislate (i.e., uncertainty, proliferation of
the laws, special interest wars, unintended effects). The civil law
worships legislation because of a desire to impose “order” on a field
where there is already spontaneous order. This naive rationalism is not
really rationalism at all: it is anti-rationalism or irrationalism.</p>
<p>The desire to plan, to impose order—whether economic or legal—on
others, is dangerous because, in the name of reason and freedom,
individual freedom is smothered. As Thomas Sowell writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its most extreme, [rationalism] exalts the most trivial or
tendentious “study” by “experts” into policy, forcibly overriding the
preferences and convictions of millions of people. While rationalism at
the individual level is a plea for more personal autonomy from cultural
norms, at the social level it is often a claim—or arrogation—of power to
stifle the autonomy of others, on the basis of superior virtuosity with
words.<a href="#fn683" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref683"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>683</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bentham is a good example of the dangerous arrogance of naive
rationalism. Bentham longed to (legislatively) codify his utilitarian
“greatest happiness principle” and, thus, to use legislation as
necessary to sweep aside any common law in his way. He:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…evinced no misgivings about the power of reason—in particular
Bentham’s reason—to decide any questions of policy <em>de novo</em>,
without benefit of authority, consensus, precedent, etc…. Bentham is not
a little the fanatic whose willingness to sweep aside the obstacles to
implementation of his proposals draws sustenance from a boundless
confidence in his own reasoning powers…. Bentham’s blind spot about the
problem of social order is of a piece with his enthusiasm for social
planning. He worried about all monopolies except the most dangerous, the
monopoly of political power.<a href="#fn684" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref684" role="doc-noteref"><sup>684</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the civil law and, indeed, all modern law, gives license to
legislators, it is irrationalistic, and does not promote, but hinders,
individual liberty and the true development of Law.</p>

<h5 id="a.-the-role-of-legislation"><em>A. The Role of
Legislation</em></h5>
<h6 id="the-secondary-role-of-legislation"><strong>1. The Secondary Role
of Legislation</strong></h6>
<p>Does all this mean that there is absolutely no room for legislation?
If anarcho-capitalism is accepted, of course there may be no legislation
because there may be no government. Relaxing this assumption, if there
is a government, then even if it is a minimalist one, it seems that
there must effectively be some legislation, if only to determine the
structure and function of the government itself. In this case, the
points made in this paper militate against any legislation at all other
than that strictly necessary to govern the government itself (e.g., a
written constitution).</p>
<p>Even if there is a state, the body of law in society should be
fashioned by a decentralized court system. The courts should be part of
a private system of courts to the extent possible, for example, a
competing system of arbitral tribunals rather than government-backed
common-law courts. But whether law-finding fora are government courts or
private courts, the legislature should have no ability to enact “laws”
that have any effect on the decisions that courts make.<a href="#fn685"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref685"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>685</sup></a></p>
<p>If we relax the anarchist/minimal state assumption once more, and
admit that a legislature should in some special cases be able to enact
statutes to override court decisions, clearly legislation should never
be seen as even <em>a</em> primary source of law, much less <em>the</em>
primary source of law, lest all the law-destroying features described
herein arise.</p>
<p>As the renowned legal scholar Alan Watson has pointed out, in
previous eras, legislation was not widely used to alter the private law
or to impose some imagined social order on society, but rather to make
the law clearer or more accessible.<a href="#fn686" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref686" role="doc-noteref"><sup>686</sup></a></p>
<p>Even Leoni was not a complete anarchist and believed in the necessity
of at least some legislation.<a href="#fn687" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref687" role="doc-noteref"><sup>687</sup></a> According to Leoni,
the role of legislation should be kept very small and applied very
carefully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Substituting legislation for the spontaneous application of
nonlegislated rules of behavior is indefensible unless it is proved that
the latter are uncertain or insufficient or that they generate some evil
that legislation could avoid while maintaining the advantages of the
previous system. <a href="#fn688" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref688"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>688</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much, if any, of today’s legislation could survive this test.
Thus, legislation must be restricted to a strictly secondary role, at
most, for a system based on the <em>primacy</em> of legislation will
inevitably subvert the spontaneous order and substitute pernicious and
chaotic rules in its stead.</p>
<h6
id="alleged-deficiencies-of-decentralized-law-finding-systems"><strong>2.
Alleged Deficiencies of Decentralized Law-Finding Systems</strong></h6>
<p>Hayek, another advocate of the spontaneous order of decentralized
systems, also believed that legislation is called for in certain
situations.<a href="#fn689" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref689"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>689</sup></a> Hayek maintained that the fact
that a “grown” system of law has some desirable characteristics that
legislation usually:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…does not mean that in other respects such law may not develop in
very undesirable directions, and that when this happens correction by
deliberate legislation may not be the only practicable way out. For a
variety of reasons the spontaneous process of growth may lead into an
impasse from which it cannot extricate itself by its own forces or which
it will at least not correct quickly enough. The development of case-law
is in some respects a sort of one-way street: when it has already moved
a considerable distance in one direction, it often cannot retrace its
steps when some implications of earlier decisions are seen to be clearly
undesirable. The fact that law that has evolved in this way has certain
desirable properties does not prove that it will always be good law or
even that some of its rules may not be very bad. It therefore does not
mean that we can altogether dispense with legislation.<a href="#fn690"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref690"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>690</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hayek also maintained that the judicial, evolutionary growth of law
may be “too slow” to bring about the “desirable” rapid adaptation of the
law to wholly new circumstances. Further, according to Hayek, a judge
would have to upset “reasonable expectations created by his earlier
decisions” to overturn an erroneous line of cases, whereas a legislator
can promulgate a new rule which is to be effective only in the future.<a
href="#fn691" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref691"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>691</sup></a></p>
<p>Objectivists are also in favor of legislation if it is the only way
to have intellectual property rights. For example, Objectivist attorney
Murray Franck writes (in response to my criticism that intellectual
property rights cannot arise on the common law, or organically, and
require legislation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[J]ust as the common law evolved to recognize “trespass by barbecue
smoke,” it would have evolved to recognize property in the airwaves and
in intellectual creations. But even if it could be established somehow
that the common law would never have recognized intellectual property
rights, this would not be an argument against such rights. The common
law often requires legislation to correct it (for example, in
recognizing the rights of women). Indeed it is a myth that the common
law evolves to reflect, and that legislation always is in conflict with,
the requirements of human nature. The same minds that employ induction
and deduction to decide a particular case, making common law, can employ
those methods to legislate universal laws.<a href="#fn692"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref692"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>692</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Epstein, a brilliant proponent of the common law, also feels
that legislation is sometimes desirable, for example, when courts cannot
come up with a number, such as a statute of limitations, which might be
very desirable.<a href="#fn693" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref693"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>693</sup></a> Without legislation, courts would
likely bar lawsuits after some length of time. But it is possible that
different courts would have different limitations periods, and some
judges may decide each case on its own merits. According to Epstein,
without a statute of limitations, no court would develop a hard and
fast, arbitrary number.<a href="#fn694" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref694" role="doc-noteref"><sup>694</sup></a> Rather, in a pure
court system, individuals could only estimate the probability of being
able to sue (or to be sued) after a given number of years. By contrast,
the number is certain under a statute of limitations. Because certainty
is desirable, and because people are risk-averse, “A single number
stated in advance truncates the risk [by] making it clear that some
actions cannot be brought.”<a href="#fn695" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref695" role="doc-noteref"><sup>695</sup></a></p>
<p>Even Blackstone was not “an uncritical opponent of statutory law….
Blackstone assigned a limited role to statutory law: its proper office
was to resolve conflicts between common law precedents and otherwise to
supplement and patch common law doctrine.” <a href="#fn696"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref696"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>696</sup></a></p>
<p>But is the common-law’s development “too slow,” at least on occasion,
as Hayek claimed? The U.S. Supreme Court has praised the common law’s
“flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation” as “the peculiar
boast and excellence of the common law.”<a href="#fn697"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref697" role="doc-noteref"><sup>697</sup></a>
For example, as Blackstone points out, judges under the common law were
able to reform the system of feudal land law without legislation. <a
href="#fn698" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref698"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>698</sup></a></p>
<p>It would seem, then, that decentralized systems are able to adapt to
new situations when it is called for.<a href="#fn699"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref699" role="doc-noteref"><sup>699</sup></a>
Additionally, it is not always desirable that basic rules (such as that
contracts should be fulfilled) should change just because societal
conditions change. Professor Epstein has explained that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social circumstances continually change, but it is wrong to suppose
that the substantive principles of the legal system should change in
response to new social conditions. The law should not be a mirror of
social organization. In private law matters, it can best perform its
essential function only if it remains constant.<a href="#fn700"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref700"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>700</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, one wonders how any external observer, such as Hayek or any
legislature, could ever know what rate of legal change is “too slow,” or
even what change is “desirable,” any more than a central planning board
can know what is the “right” price to charge for a gallon of milk.
Indeed, Hayek’s own insights into the virtues of spontaneous order and
the problems of central economic planning demonstrate the ignorance of
any central planner in this regard.</p>
<p>I admit that, in some circumstances, a decentralized body of law can
err and seem to need “patching”; and indeed, all things being equal, a
statute of limitations might be better than none at all. Unfortunately,
however, all things are <em>not</em> equal, because of the problems that
inevitably accompany legislation. The choice is between a fallible
system of decentralized law with no legislature and an even more
fallible and dangerous legislative means of making law. To “patch”
common law by legislation, you have to first empower a legislature. As
Mises wisely put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No socialist author ever gave a thought to the possibility that the
abstract entity which he wants to vest with unlimited power—whether it
is called humanity, society, nation, state, or government—could act in a
way of which he himself disapproves.<a href="#fn701"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref701"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>701</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Mises here warns, a legislature will not be content to merely fix
one bad law. Rather, legislation will eventually overwhelm and suffocate
the naturally-developed body of law and engender uncertainty; special
interest warfare and quick fix laws will proliferate; and the government
will eventually abuse its sovereign position by engaging in economic and
human planning.</p>
<p>Epstein may well be correct that not having a definite period for
liberative prescription may inject uncertainty into the legal process.
Unfortunately, the attempt to cure this by empowering a legislature also
increases the general uncertainty in society. Which uncertainty is
greater? And what about the liberty of individuals who have their right
to sue artificially limited by a statute of limitations? How can we know
that the benefit to them (or even to others) is greater than the harm
done to them? Because values are subjective to the individual, and
because of the economic calculation problem, no central governmental
legislature can know whether the benefits of a statute of limitations
are worth the cost of such legislation.<a href="#fn702"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref702" role="doc-noteref"><sup>702</sup></a>
Furthermore, why is it justifiable to harm one individual to benefit
another?</p>
<p>Another problem with urging legislation as a solution to common law
gone astray is that this assumes that the legislature can be convinced
to make the correct legal reform. First, this is a very dubious
assumption, especially given the special interest lobbying that
legislators face, and also given the fact that legislators tend to be
people who are interested in power rather than philosopher-kings who
want to do the right thing.<a href="#fn703" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref703" role="doc-noteref"><sup>703</sup></a> Second, if a
proponent of legislation assumes that reasonable and humane legislators
can see the light of reason and correctly reform the law, why is it not
at least as likely that judges can be persuaded as well?</p>
<p>Especially in an anarcho-capitalistic system—i.e., in a free
society—in which all courts are private and compete for business by
selling and producing “justice,” the courts at least have an incentive
to continually refine the rules in a just direction. If Epstein and
legislators can see the value of a fixed time limit to instituting a
lawsuit, so can the public, which would create a demand for such a rule.
Private court systems that offered such rules to cater to consumer
demand would tend to draw more customers and lawsuits than relatively
unjust competitor-courts. Thus there is a natural incentive for courts,
at least competing courts in a free society, to search for justice and
to strive to adopt it, so as to cater to a justice-seeking consumer
base.</p>
<h6 id="structural-safeguards-to-limit-legislation"><strong>3.
Structural Safeguards to Limit Legislation</strong></h6>
<p>For all these reasons, I do not believe that legislation is a
legitimate or practical means of creating law, or even of patching it.
If a legislature can be convinced to recognize and respect the right
law, so can a decentralized court system, especially one competing with
other courts for customers. Courts do not face the same pernicious and
systematic incentives that legislators do to make bad laws, and many of
them. And courts, if they go bad, at least have a more limited effect on
society; whereas when legislatures go bad, there is no end to the evil
that they can perpetrate.<a href="#fn704" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref704" role="doc-noteref"><sup>704</sup></a></p>
<p>If legislation can be considered valid at all (given a governmental
system), it can only be occasional or spurious legislation that modifies
the body of law which is <em>primarily</em> developed by a court-based,
decentralized law-finding system—or legislation that controls how the
state itself is limited and organized. If we must have legislation,
several constitutional safeguards should accompany its exercise, to
attempt to restrict legislation to a purely secondary role in the
formation of law. Certainly, a supermajority,<a href="#fn705"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref705" role="doc-noteref"><sup>705</sup></a>
and maybe a referendum, should be required in order to enact any
statutes whatever, except perhaps for statutes that repeal prior
statutes or that limit governmental power.</p>
<p>In addition to a supermajority requirement, another reform that might
be considered would be for all legislation to be limited to replacing
the opinion of a given court decision with a new decision, which would
have purely prospective effect. Then, if a given case or line of cases
were issued that had particularly egregious reasoning or results, a
supermajority could form in the legislature that would rewrite the
unfortunate opinion in purportedly better form and enact this into law,
as if the court had first issued the rewritten decision. The rewritten
opinion would then assume the status of a judicial precedent, at least
for that court.</p>
<p>The benefit of this limitation is that it would prevent legislatures
from enacting huge legislative schemes out of whole cloth. There would
simply be no way for the legislature to enact an Americans with
Disabilities Act, since any statute would really be a rewritten judicial
opinion, and to the extent the legislated substitute opinion strayed
from the facts of the particular case, it would be merely
<em>dicta</em>. If a judge in a battery case, for example, ruled that
the spotted owl or the intelligent socialist was now an endangered
species, such language would be completely irrelevant, since it is
beyond a judge’s power to enact an Endangered Species Act in any
judicial opinion. Such a mechanism for legislation would allow very bad
case law developments to be overcome, but would also severely restrict
the ability of legislatures to radically restructure the law, and thus
would reduce the incidence of vote-buying and special interest lobbying,
the amount of uncertainty, the proliferation of statutes, and the amount
of social planning and other mischief that a legislature might otherwise
be inclined to engage in.</p>
<p>Other provisions that could help to limit the dangerous effects of
having a legislature include a line-item veto by the executive branch
and sunset provisions that automatically repeal legislation unless
re-enacted<br />
after a given number of years. Another useful prophylactic measure would
be an absolute right to jury trials in <em>all</em> cases, civil or
criminal (so that government could not escape the jury requirement by
calling truly criminal sanctions “civil”), in which the application of a
statute is involved. This should be combined with a requirement that the
jury be made aware of their right to judge the <em>law</em>’s validity
as well as the defendant’s liability or guilt.<a href="#fn706"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref706"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>706</sup></a></p>
<p>The right of law-abiding citizens to own weapons of any sort, without
any registration requirement, is also essential so that an armed public
can stand as a last bulwark against a tyrannical government. Even with
such safeguards, the power of a government armed with the power to
legislate, the power to create and rewrite “law,” is awesome, and
fearsome, to behold.</p>
<h5 id="b.-the-role-of-commentators-and-codes"><em>B. The Role of
Commentators and Codes</em></h5>
<p>The criticisms of legislation apply even to civil codes, the most
impressive component of modern civil law. Admittedly, the civil law, at
least as embodied in a civil code, is superior to the common law in many
ways. The civilian system of property rights, not mired in feudalistic
form as is the British common law, is much cleaner and
conceptually<br />
more sound than common law real property.<a href="#fn707"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref707" role="doc-noteref"><sup>707</sup></a>
Common-law real property concepts are almost painful to the mind. As
another example, the irrational common-law requirement of
“consideration” to create a binding obligation<a href="#fn708"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref708" role="doc-noteref"><sup>708</sup></a>
is replaced in the civil law with the more sensible prerequisite of
“cause.”<a href="#fn709" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref709"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>709</sup></a> However, these superior qualities
of the civil law are not due to its legislated character but to the
superior legal concepts that evolved in the Roman law.</p>
<p>But the civil code also contains many illiberal and thus illegitimate
provisions, which are a problem only because the code is legislated into
law. If the civil code were a private, unlegislated codification, judges
could simply ignore its illiberal provisions. A particularly egregious
example of an unjust law is Louisiana’s forced heirship regime,<a
href="#fn710" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref710"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>710</sup></a> which limits individuals’ ability
to dispose of their own property as they wish upon death. Also, in the
civil law, certain sales may be annulled if “too low” a price was paid
by the buyer,<a href="#fn711" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref711"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>711</sup></a> which violates the rights of
property owners to dispose of their property, and which also foolishly
assumes that the government knows better than the seller and buyer what
the right price is for an item.<a href="#fn712" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref712" role="doc-noteref"><sup>712</sup></a></p>
<p>Ignoring relatively minor problems such as these, the civil code in
and of itself is largely commendable, especially insofar as it embodies
and systematizes a naturally grown body of law.<a href="#fn713"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref713" role="doc-noteref"><sup>713</sup></a>
But the civil law is more than the civil code: it is legislation made
paramount. Legislation is considered the primary source of law—indeed,
the civil code itself is legislated—and thus all the problems of
legislation discussed above apply to the civil law. When the civil code
is enacted as a statute, it is no wonder that proponents of the civil
code would naturally view legislation as supreme and tend to view
legislation as the primary source of law. And then even the civil code
itself tends to develop legislative characteristics, such as code
articles enacted at the behest of special interests; illiberal
provisions such as those cited above; and specialized, detailed articles
out of place in a generalized code.</p>
<p>The civil law would be much improved if the civil code were more like
a constitution, in that its provisions would prevail over any contrary
statute, and in that some sort of supermajority requirement would be
needed to amend it. But we already have constitutions, both state and
federal. I do believe that the basic libertarian principles specified
herein—<br />
the individual rights to self-ownership and to own property, as embodied
in the libertarian non-aggression axiom—should be followed by any judge,
but this does not necessarily mean there must be a statute or
constitution specifying these principles. It is only important that
judges recognize them and, in the long run, this can only happen if a
consensus in society recognizes the validity of such principles in the
first place. Our task is always education. If the public were ever to
become libertarian enough to adopt a libertarian constitution, one would
probably not be needed, since private justice supplied on the market, or
even in government-based common-law courts, would veer in a libertarian
direction in response to the people’s sense of justice.</p>
<p>But if a libertarian constitution or code were in place, it would be
relatively sparse. It would specify as first principles that the
initiation of force is illegitimate and that the individual rights to
own one’s own body and any property one homesteads or acquires
voluntarily from other owners are absolute and inviolable. As deductions
therefrom, it could specify that rape, murder, theft, assault, battery,
and trespass are also rights-violations. As Rothbard states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Law Code of a purely free society would simply enshrine the
libertarian axiom: prohibition of any violence against the person or
property of another (except in defense of someone’s person or property),
property to be defined as self-ownership plus the ownership of resources
that one has found, transformed, or bought or received after such
transformation. The task of the Code would be to spell out the
implications of this axiom (e.g., the libertarian sections of the law
merchant or common law would be co-opted, while the statist accretions
would be discarded). The Code would then be applied to specific cases by
the free-market judges, who would all pledge themselves to follow it.<a
href="#fn714" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref714"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>714</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I would add that the “libertarian” sections of Roman law, e.g., as
embodied in modern civil codes, could be adopted in developing
Rothbard’s libertarian Law Code, or at least could be referred to by
private courts in fashioning legal rules to handle actual disputes.)</p>
<p>But because of the near-infinite variety of ways in which humans can
interact, such a code could never be made all-comprehensive. Any
codifier who attempted to do this would face the information problems
discussed herein. At some point judges need to consider the particular
facts of a controversy and, keeping principles of justice in mind, eke
out the applicable rule. Judges will sometimes make mistakes, but, then,
the fact that individuals are fallible can never be escaped, so this
criticism is moot.</p>
<p>It is true that a decentralized, gradually-developed body of case law
can become unwieldy and difficult to research. But it is not more so
than the modern morass of statutes. I cannot see how either a lawyer or
the average layman would have an easier time discerning what law applies
to him in a given situation under today’s statute-ridden laws, as
opposed to in a decentralized legal system, having a body of
judge-discovered principles. Surely in both cases laymen may resort to
specialists such as attorneys and explanatory treatises to tell them
what the law is. At least in a decentralized system the law is less
likely to change from day to day, so that when a person knows what the
law is today he is more certain it will be the law tomorrow. And there
are likely to be far fewer laws regulating far fewer aspects of our
daily lives in a judge-based system, which should make it easier to
determine what the relevant law is concerning a given situation.</p>
<p>There is, for these reasons, a significant role for codification in a
free society, but only for private, not legislative, codification. To
the extent such private codes are systematic and rational, they can both
influence the rational development of the law and present or systematize
it in concise form for lawyers and laymen alike. We already have
treatises such as the American Law Institute’s <em>Restatements</em> of
the law, <em>Texas Jurisprudence Third</em>, <em>American Jurisprudence
Second</em>, and <em>Corpus Juris Secundum</em>. These treatises would
be far more rational and systematic, and shorter, if they did not have
to take an unwieldy and interfering body of legislation into account; if
they could focus primarily on common-law developments. Legal scholars
who currently draft civil code articles for consideration and enactment
by a legislature could surely dedicate their energies to privately
codifying and systematizing the body of case law that has been
developed. <a href="#fn715" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref715"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>715</sup></a></p>
<p>Even a true codification of existing case law can make mistakes. If
the code is private, judges can ignore the lapses in the commentator’s
reasoning. Of course, this has the extra benefit of giving an incentive
to private codifiers not to engage in dishonest reasoning or meddlesome
social planning. If a codifier wants his work to be used and
acknowledged, he will attempt to accurately describe the existing body
of law when he organizes and presents it, and will likely be explicit
when recommending that judges adopt certain changes in future
decisions.</p>
<p>Law codes should thus be strictly private. We have long seen the
wisdom of keeping church and state separate. Theorists like Mises, and
the collapse of socialism, teach the virtues of the separation of
economy and state. True advocates of a libertarian social and legal
order should favor the separation of law and state.<a href="#fn716"

role="doc-noteref"><sup>716</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="c.-common-law-vs.-civil-law"><em>C. Common Law vs. Civil
Law</em></h5>
<p>While in this chapter I argue for the superiority of decentralized
law discovery systems such as the Roman law and common law over modern
legislation-dominant systems, many libertarians in the past have tended
to favor the English common law over competing systems, including modern
civil law, even though the civil codes, although<br />
legislated, are elegant codifications of private law principles that
themselves evolved in the decentralized Roman Law legal system. The fact
that modern civil codes are enacted as statutes and enshrine legal or
legislative positivism is indeed a negative.<a href="#fn717"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref717" role="doc-noteref"><sup>717</sup></a>
This does not detract from the value of having an elegant written
summary of the law prepared by legal scholars distilling and summarizing
the body of private law developed in more or less decentralized systems
over the ages.</p>
<p>Moreover, the common law itself, as noted, has been increasingly
submerged in a sea of legislation, ever since the rise of the
administrative state and democratic law-making in the 20th century. And
as noted above, Alan Watson has pointed out that in the past,
legislation was used mainly to make the law clearer or more accessible,
not to make drastic change or impose a new social order.<a href="#fn718"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref718" role="doc-noteref"><sup>718</sup></a>
This is in contrast to modern democratic law-making—legislation—that has
increasingly become the dominant source of law and is used for
widespread social engineering.</p>
<p>Hans-Hermann Hoppe has also commented on the relative merits of the
English common law versus the European continental and Romanesque civil
law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the structure that the initial founding cantons in
Switzerland had, where all free men swore an oath that they would come
to mutually assist each other in case of an attack against them. And
these cities frequently had written law codes, that is, Magdeburg Law or
Hamburg Law or Hanover Law or Lübeck Law, etc., so that people who moved
to these cities knew what law code would apply to them, and when new
cities were founded, the normal thing to do was to adopt one of the
already existing law codes and maybe make a few amendments to it. That
is, some law codes became the law codes, not just of one city, but of
many, many cities, who adopted the initial example of a place that first
took the initiative to write these laws down.</p>
<p>In this connection, let me make a little side remark. In
English-speaking countries, America and England, there is a certain
amount of pride in having the so-called common law, which is, in a way,
noncodified law, or case law. The Continental tradition, as you know,
has been for a long time different. There, we have had codified law
taken from the Romans, especially from the East Romans who had codified
this law for the first time in an extensive manner and then, of course,
in modern times, the Napoleonic Code, which has been taken over by most
Continental European states in one form or another with some
modifications. And, as I said, Anglo-Saxons looked down on codified law
and hailed their own noncodified common law. I want to just remark that,
for instance, Max Weber has a very interesting observation regarding
this. He sees the reason for the noncodification of the common law in
the self-interest of the lawyers to make the law difficult to understand
for the layman and thus make a lot of money. He emphasizes that codified
law makes it possible for the layman on the street who can read to study
the law book himself and go to court himself and point out, here, that
this law is written down. So, maybe this excessive pride that the
Anglo-Saxons have in their common law might be a little bit overdrawn.<a
href="#fn719" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref719"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>719</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to agree with this. What is admirable about the common law is
that it is decentralized. But so was the Roman law. Today’s world is
dominated by legislation and legal positivism, so the common view is
that the civil law and common law are distinct. But this fails to
recognize that the civil law, although legislated as a statute, is still
a codification of a body of private law principles developed largely in
the decentralized Roman law system, plus European custom that developed
in intervening centuries—and that the common law of today is being
overwhelmed with a growing body of statutory law (as are the continental
civil codes). It is not so clear that the <em>substance</em> of the
English common law is significantly better or more libertarian than the
substance of the Roman law as embodied in the modern continental civil
codes. In fact, as noted in this chapter, in many respects the Roman
legal concepts are arguably superior to common law principles (for
example, the Roman law has a more conceptually elegant and streamlined
system of property rights, as opposed to the cluttered common law
system, which is mired in feudalistic concepts; and the Roman law’s
concept of contract is in some ways superior, since it does not have the
unnecessary and formalistic doctrine of consideration).<a href="#fn720"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref720"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>720</sup></a></p>
<p>What we should be wary of is legal and legislative positivism, of
relying on legislation as a dominant means of making law. And while we
can appreciate the civil codes, along with private “codifications” of
the law or treatises such as the ALI’s <em>Restatements</em> of the law,
and older treatises such as those by Blackstone and Coke, we should
oppose efforts to codify the common law in various jurisdictions and
enact them as positive legislation, such as David Dudley Field’s attempt
to (legislatively) codify New York’s common law in the late 1800s. This
was vigorously fought by New York lawyer James C. Carter. Carter opposed
replacing case law with centralized legislation. He notes that caselaw
precedents are flexible and allow the judge to do justice, while
statutes are applied literally, even where injustice is done or the
legislator did not contemplate the result. Thus, Carter argues, one of
the worst effects of legislatively codifying law—replacing organically
developed law with artificial statutes—is that it changes the role of
courts and judges from one in which the judge searches for justice into
mere squabbles over definitions of words found in statutes. As Carter
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At present, when any doubt arises in any particular case as to what
the true rule of the unwritten [i.e., judge-found, common-law developed]
law is, it is at once assumed that the rule most in accordance with
justice and sound policy is the one which must be declared to be the
law. The search is for that rule. The appeal is squarely made to the
highest considerations of morality and justice. These are the rallying
points of the struggle. The contention is ennobling and beneficial to
the advocates, to the judges, to the parties, to the auditors, and so
indirectly to the whole community. The decision then made records
another step in the advance of human reason towards that perfection
after which it forever aspires. But when the law is conceded to be
written down in a statute, and the only question is what the statute
means, a contention unspeakably inferior is substituted. The dispute is
about <em>words</em>. The question of what is right or wrong, just or
unjust, is irrelevant and out of place. The only question is what has
been written. What a wretched exchange for the manly encounter upon the
elevated plane of principle!<a href="#fn721" class="footnote-ref"

<h4 id="vi.-conclusion">VI. CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>Virtues such as individual liberty and legal certainty, understood as
aspects of a just, libertarian polity, are indeed objectively valid
standards that any legal system must uphold. Centralized legal
systems—even those that attempt to embody libertarian virtues, such as
the civil law—undercut individual rights, because in them legislation is
made supreme and valid; because law-finding is replaced with
law-making.</p>
<p>Both the Roman law and common law have been corrupted into today’s
inferior legislation-dominated systems. The primacy of legislation
should be abandoned, and we should return to a system of judge-made
law—a private system, ideally, but in the direction of systems like the
old common law and Roman law, at least. Scholars who codify
naturally-evolved law have a vital function to serve, but they should
not ask for governmental imprimatur on their scholarly efforts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the form of a legal system does not guarantee that just
laws will be adopted. We must always be vigilant and urge that
individual freedom be respected, whether by legislator or judge.</p>

<p>Legislative supremacy is announced in the very first articles of the

<p>Yet some scholars note that the Louisiana code is not quite as

admits custom as a source of law and, importantly, also provides: “When
no rule for a particular situation can be derived from legislation or
custom, the court is bound to proceed according to equity. To decide

IP, over the years, starting with <em>Against Intellectual
Property</em>, first published in 2001.<sup>*</sup> This chapter,
originally intended for a symposium issue of the <em>Griffith Law
Review</em> but withdrawn/rejected because of a dispute with the
editors, was originally published in my journal <em>Libertarian
Papers</em> in 2013. It was the most comprehensive article I’d written
on IP since <em>AIP</em>.<sup>†</sup> It incorporates much of the
material from that work and includes some additional material that I had
published in the intervening decade or so. Chapter 15 contains
additional arguments developed subsequently and complements this work
and <em>AIP</em>. These two chapters, together, contain a good
presentation of my current views and arguments related to
IP.<sup>††</sup></p>
<p><sup>*</sup> <em>Journal of Libertarian Studies</em> 15, no. 2
(Spring 2001): 1–53. Hereinafter, <em>AIP</em>. In this chapter I will
cite the 2008 edition of <em>AIP</em> (www.c4sif.org/aip). In
<em>AIP</em> I thanked “Wendy McElroy and Gene Callahan for helpful
comments on an earlier draft.” My article “In Defense of Napster and
Against the Second Homesteading Rule,” <em>LewRockwell.com</em>
(September 4, 2000) presented a summary version of the argument later
elaborated in <em>AIP</em>. I thanked Gil Guillory for helpful comments
on that piece.</p>

The publication history is detailed at Kinsella, “Kinsella, ‘Law and
Intellectual Property in a Stateless Society,’” <em>C4SIF Blog</em>
(March 1, 2013). The structure of the article is similar to the more
concise “Intellectual Property and Libertarianism,” <em>Mises Daily</em>
(Nov. 17, 2009). The title is slightly misleading because the article
was really about why IP is unjust and had little to do with anarchy or
stateless societies; the title and the slight emphasis on stateless
societies in the text was intended to make the article fit the theme of
the symposium issue it was intended for, which was “Law and Anarchy:
Legal Order and the Idea of a Stateless Society.” I’ve chosen to retain
the original title here.</p>
<p><sup>††</sup> For those interested in reading my original
<em>AIP</em>, I suggest instead the similar version “The Case Against
Intellectual Property,” in <em>Handbook of the Philosophical Foundations
of Business Ethics</em> (Prof. Dr. Christoph Lütge, ed.; Springer, 2013)
(chapter 68, in Part 18, “Property Rights: Material and Intellectual,”

<h4 id="i.-introduction-3">I. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>It is widely recognized that the institutional protection of property
rights was a necessary (though probably not sufficient)<a href="#fn728"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref728" role="doc-noteref"><sup>728</sup></a>
condition for the radical prosperity experienced in the West since the
advent of the industrial revolution. And property rights include
so-called “intellectual property” (IP) rights which emerged in their
modern form around the same time.<a href="#fn729" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref729" role="doc-noteref"><sup>729</sup></a> Or so we have been
told. The idea that IP rights are a legitimate type of property right,
and a necessary part of a free market economy, has been taken for
granted since the dawn of modern patent and copyright approximately two
centuries ago.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread assumption that IP is legitimate, even its
proponents seem somewhat uneasy with it. Thus most of them favor limited
terms for patent and copyright—about 17 years for the former and usually
over 100 years for the latter—unlike the potentially perpetual ownership
of traditional forms of property.<a href="#fn730" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref730" role="doc-noteref"><sup>730</sup></a> And there is
continual dissatisfaction with the state of the law, its ambiguities and
arbitrary standards, and with patent office efficiency and competence,
or lack thereof. There are incessant calls for “reform,” and for curbs
on “misuse” or “abuse” of patent and copyright. But in these complaints
and debates, it is almost always taken for granted that some form of
copyright and patent are essential, even if reform is needed.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, increasing numbers of libertarians have
begun to doubt the very legitimacy of IP.<a href="#fn731"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref731" role="doc-noteref"><sup>731</sup></a>
In this chapter I argue that patent and copyright should be abolished
entirely, not merely reformed.</p>
<p>As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to describe the libertarian
view of property rights. As this discussion will make clear, IP rights
such as patent and copyright are inconsistent with the private property
order that would characterize a stateless, private-law society. I will
follow with a discussion of what practices or laws might prevail in the
absence of IP.</p>
<h4 id="ii.-the-libertarian-framework732">II. THE LIBERTARIAN
FRAMEWORK<a href="#fn732" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref732"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>732</sup></a></h4>
<h5 id="a.-property-rights-and-liberty"><em>A. Property, Rights, and
Liberty</em></h5>
<p>Libertarians tend to agree on a wide array of policies and
principles. Nonetheless, it is not easy to find consensus on what
libertarianism’s defining characteristic is, or on what distinguishes it
from other political theories and systems.</p>
<p>Various formulations abound. It is said that libertarianism is
concerned with individual rights, property rights,<a href="#fn733"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref733" role="doc-noteref"><sup>733</sup></a>
the free market, capitalism, freedom, liberty, justice, or the
nonaggression principle. But are any of these ideas truly fundamental or
foundational? “Capitalism” and “the free market,” for example, describe
the catallactic conditions that arise or are permitted in a libertarian
society, but they do not encompass other aspects of libertarianism.<a
href="#fn734" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref734"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>734</sup></a> And individual rights, justice,
and nonaggression collapse into property rights. As Murray Rothbard
explained, individual rights are property rights.<a href="#fn735"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref735" role="doc-noteref"><sup>735</sup></a>
And justice simply means giving someone his due, which depends on what
his (property) rights are.<a href="#fn736" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref736" role="doc-noteref"><sup>736</sup></a></p>
<p>The nonaggression principle is also dependent on property rights,
since what aggression is depends on what our (property) rights are. If
you hit me, it is aggression <em>because</em> I have a property right in
my body. If I take from you the apple you possess, this is
trespass—aggression—only <em>because</em> you own the apple. One cannot
identify an act of aggression without implicitly assigning a
corresponding property right to the victim. “Freedom” and “liberty” face
difficulties similar to that of the concept of aggression, as indicated
in the common saying, “Your freedom ends where my nose begins!”</p>
<p>So capitalism and the free market are too narrow, and justice,
individual rights, liberty, freedom, and aggression all boil down to, or
are defined in terms of, property rights.</p>
<p>What of property rights, then? Is this what differentiates
libertarianism from other political philosophies—that we favor property
rights, and all others do not? Surely such a claim is untenable. After
all, a property right is simply the <em>exclusive right to control a
scarce resource</em>. As Professor Yiannopoulos explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Property</em> may be defined as an <em>exclusive right to control
an economic good</em>…; it is the name of a concept that refers to the
rights and obligations, privileges and restrictions that govern the
relations of man with respect to <em>things of value</em>. People
everywhere and at all times desire the possession of things that are
necessary for survival or valuable by cultural definition and which, as
a result of the demand placed upon them, <em>become scarce</em>. Laws
enforced by organized society control the competition for, and guarantee
the enjoyment of, these desired things. What is guaranteed to be one’s
own is property… [Property rights] <em>confer a direct and immediate
authority over a thing</em>.<a href="#fn737" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref737" role="doc-noteref"><sup>737</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, property rights specify which persons own—that is,
have the right to control—various scarce resources in a given region or
jurisdiction. Yet every political theory advances <em>some</em> theory
of property. None of the various forms of socialism deny property rights
<em>per se</em>; each system will specify an owner for each contestable
scarce resource.<a href="#fn738" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref738"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>738</sup></a> If the state nationalizes an
industry, it is asserting ownership of those means of production. If the
state taxes you, it is implicitly asserting ownership of the funds
taken. If my land is transferred to a private developer by eminent
domain statutes, the developer is now the owner. If the law allows a
recipient of racial discrimination to sue his employer for a sum of
money, he is the owner of the money.<a href="#fn739"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref739"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>739</sup></a></p>
<p>Protection of and respect for property rights is thus not unique to
libertarianism. What is distinctive about libertarianism is its
<em>particular property assignment rules</em>: that is, the rules that
determine who owns each contestable resource.</p>
<h5 id="b.-property-in-bodies"><em>B. Property in Bodies</em></h5>
<p>As indicated above, every legal system assigns a particular owner to
each scarce resource. These resources obviously include natural
resources such as land, fruits on trees, and so on. Things found in
nature are not the only scarce resources, however. Each human actor has,
controls, and is identified and associated with a unique human body,
which is also a scarce resource.<a href="#fn740" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref740" role="doc-noteref"><sup>740</sup></a> Both human bodies
and nonhuman, scarce resources are desired for use as <em>means</em> by
actors in the pursuit of various goals.<a href="#fn741"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref741"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>741</sup></a></p>
<p>Accordingly, any political theory or system must assign ownership or
control rights in human bodies as well as in external things.<a
href="#fn742" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref742"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>742</sup></a> However, there are relevant
differences between these two types of scarce resources that justify
treating them separately.</p>
<p>Let us consider first the libertarian property assignment rules with
respect to human bodies, and the corresponding notion of aggression as
it pertains to bodies. Libertarians often vigorously assert the
“nonaggression principle.” As Ayn Rand said, “So long as men desire to
live together, no man may <em>initiate</em>—do you hear me? No man may
<em>start</em>—the use of physical force against others.”<a
href="#fn743" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref743"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>743</sup></a> Or, as Rothbard put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The libertarian creed rests upon one central principle, or “axiom”:
that no man or group of men may aggress against the person or property
of anyone else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.”
“Aggression” is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of
physical violence against the person or property of anyone else.
Aggression is therefore synonymous with invasion.<a href="#fn744"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref744"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>744</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, at least when it comes to human bodies, libertarians
maintain that the only way to violate rights is by <em>initiating</em>
force—that is, by committing aggression. And, correspondingly, that
force used <em>in response</em> to aggression—such as defensive,
restitutive, or retaliatory/retributive force—is justified.<a
href="#fn745" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref745"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>745</sup></a></p>
<p>Now in the case of the body, it is clear what aggression is: invading
the borders of someone’s body, commonly called battery, or, more
generally, using the body of another without his or her consent.<a
href="#fn746" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref746"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>746</sup></a> The very notion of interpersonal
aggression presupposes property rights in bodies—more particularly, that
each person is, at least <em>prima facie</em>, the owner of his own
body.<a href="#fn747" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref747"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>747</sup></a> And the notion of self-ownership
corresponds to the non-aggression principle. Both imply each other, or
are alternate ways of stating the same basic idea: that no person may
use another’s body without his or her consent; to do so is unjustified
and impermissible aggression.</p>
<p>Non-libertarian political philosophies do not accept the libertarian
self-ownership principle. According to them, each person has
<em>some</em> limited rights in his own body, but not complete or
exclusive rights. Society—or the state, purporting to be society’s
agent—has certain rights in each citizen’s body, too. The state may
limit or override the individual’s control over his own body. This
partial slavery is implicit in state actions such as taxation,
conscription, drug prohibitions, and other regulations and laws.</p>
<p>The libertarian says that each person is the <em>full owner</em> of
his body: he has the right to control his body, to decide whether or not
he ingests narcotics, joins an army, and so on. Others, however,
maintain that the state, or society, is at least a partial owner of the
bodies of those subject to such laws—or even a nearly complete owner in
the case of conscriptees or nonaggressor “criminals” incarcerated for
life or those killed by government bombs. Libertarians believe in
<em>self</em>-ownership. Non-libertarians—statists—of all stripes
advocate some form of slavery. This is virtually implicit in the nature
of the state as an agency that asserts the right to be “the ultimate
arbiter in every case of conflict, including conflicts involving itself,
[and that] allows no appeal above and beyond itself.”<a href="#fn748"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref748" role="doc-noteref"><sup>748</sup></a>
This arrangement permits the state to override individuals’
self-ownership rights—to, in effect, become their master or
overlord.</p>
<p>As an illustration, consider this exchange between a communist party
official and a farmer in China in 1978, when farmers were prohibited
from private ownership of their crop yields: “At one meeting with
communist party officials, a farmer asked: ‘What about the teeth in my
head? Do I own those?’ Answer: No. Your teeth belong to the
collective.”<a href="#fn749" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref749"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>749</sup></a></p>
<p>Libertarians believe the farmer should own his teeth, his body, his
home, his farm, and his crop yields.</p>
<h5 id="c.-self-ownership-and-conflict-avoidance"><em>C. Self-Ownership
and Conflict-Avoidance</em></h5>
<p>There is always the possibility of conflict over contestable (scarce,
conflictable)<a href="#fn750" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref750"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>750</sup></a> resources. This is in the very
nature of scarce, or rivalrous, resources. By assigning an owner to each
resource, the legal or property rights system establishes objective,
publicly visible or discernible boundaries or borders that nonowners can
avoid. This makes conflict-<br />
free, productive, cooperative use of resources possible. This is true of
human bodies as well as of external objects.<a href="#fn751"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref751" role="doc-noteref"><sup>751</sup></a>
If we seek rules that permit peaceful, productive, and conflict-free use
of our very bodies, some rules allocating body ownership must be
established. These basic values, or <em>grundnorms</em>—peace,
conflict-avoidance, prosperity—and related ones such as justice,
cooperation, and civilization, are the reason that libertarians, indeed
any civilized person who adopts these basic values, seek property
assignment rules in the first place.<a href="#fn752"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref752" role="doc-noteref"><sup>752</sup></a>
We prefer society and civilization to mayhem and fighting and violence.
Libertarians believe that self-ownership (and other property acquisition
rules discussed further below) is the only property assignment rule
compatible with these <em>grundnorms</em>; it is implied by them.</p>
<p>As noted above, the libertarian view is that the appropriate
body-ownership rule is that each person is, <em>prima facie</em>, a
self-owner: each person owns his own body. It might be argued, however,
that <em>any</em> property assignment rule would suffice to permit
conflict-free use of resources, that the libertarian self-ownership rule
is not necessary. As long as everyone knows who owns a given
resource—even if it is a king or tyrant—then people can avoid conflict
by respecting existing property boundaries. In the case of bodies, this
would mean some form of slavery, where some people are owned partially
or completely by others.<a href="#fn753" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref753" role="doc-noteref"><sup>753</sup></a> Whether a person
<em>A</em> is a self-owner, or owned by some other person or group
<em>B,</em> everyone can know who gets to decide who can use
<em>A</em>’s body, and thus conflict can be avoided so long as everyone
respects this property right allocation.</p>
<p>The libertarian view is that only its particular property assignment
rule—<em>self</em>-ownership, as opposed to <em>other</em>-ownership
(slavery)—fulfills the conflict-avoidance role of property rights. This
is so for several interrelated reasons.</p>
<p>First, as Professor Hoppe has argued, the assignment of ownership to
a given resource must not be random, arbitrary, particularistic, or
biased if the property norm is to serve the function of
conflict-avoidance.<a href="#fn754" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref754"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>754</sup></a> This is because any possible norm
designed to avoid conflict must be justified in the context of
argumentation, in which participants put forth <em>reasons</em> in
support of their proposed norms. The norms proposed in genuine
argumentation claim universal acceptability, i.e. they must be
universalizable. Reasons must be provided that can in principle be
acceptable to both sides as grounded in the nature of things, not merely
arbitrary or “particularistic” rules such as “I get to hit you, but you
do not get to hit me, because I am me and you are you.” Such an
arbitrary assertion fails to even attempt to justify the proposed norm.
For another example, <em>B</em>’s claim that he owns his own body and
also owns <em>A</em>’s body, while <em>A</em> does not get to own his
own body, is an obviously particularistic claim that makes arbitrary
distinctions between two otherwise-similar agents, where the distinction
is not grounded in any objective difference between <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>. Such particularistic norms or reasons are not
universalizable; that is, they are <em>not reasons at all</em>, and thus
are contrary to the purpose and nature of the activity of justificatory
argumentation.</p>
<p>When assigning property title to a disputed or contested resource,
such as <em>A</em>’s body, some objective link must be found between the
claimant and the resource, so that ownership can be established that can
be recognized publicly by others and also acceptable as fair and as
grounded in the nature of things. As I wrote elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]here are only two fundamental alternatives for acquiring rights in
unowned property: (1) by doing something with the property with which no
one else had ever done before, such as the mixing of labor or
homesteading; or (2) by mere verbal declaration or decree. The second
alternative is arbitrary and cannot serve to avoid conflicts. Only the
first alternative, that of Lockean homesteading, establishes an
objective link between a particular person and a particular scarce
resource; thus, no one can deny the Lockean right to homestead unowned
resources.<a href="#fn755" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref755"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>755</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, as Hoppe has argued, property title has to be assigned to one
of competing claimants based on “the existence of an objective,
intersubjectively ascertainable link between owner and the” resource
claimed.<a href="#fn756" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref756"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>756</sup></a> In the case of one’s own body, it
is the unique relationship between a person and his body—<em>his direct
and immediate control</em> over his body and the fact that, at least in
some sense, a body is a given person and vice versa—that constitutes the
objective link sufficient to give that person a claim to his body
superior to those of typical third party claimants.</p>
<p>Moreover, any outsider who claims another’s body cannot deny this
objective link and its special status, since the outsider also
necessarily presupposes this in his own case. This is so because, in
seeking dominion over the other and in asserting ownership over the
other’s body, he has to presuppose his own ownership of his body. In so
doing, the outsider demonstrates that he <em>does</em> place a certain
significance on this link, even as (at the same time) he disregards the
significance of the other’s link to his own body.<a href="#fn757"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref757"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>757</sup></a></p>
<p>For these reasons, libertarianism recognizes that only the
self-ownership rule is universalizable and compatible with the
<em>grundnorms</em> of peace, cooperation, and conflict-avoidance. We
recognize that each person is <em>prima facie</em> the owner of his own
body because, by virtue of his unique link to and connection with his
own body—his direct and immediate control over it—he has a better claim
to it than anyone else.<a href="#fn758" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref758" role="doc-noteref"><sup>758</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="d.-property-in-external-things"><em>D. Property in External
Things</em></h5>
<p>Libertarians apply similar reasoning in the case of other scarce
resources—namely, external objects in the world. One key difference
between bodies and external resources—and the reason for their separate
treatment—is that the latter were at one point <em>unowned</em> and are
<em>acquired by</em> human actors who are <em>already necessarily
body-owners</em>. This difference implies a related distinction: as
noted above, in the case of bodies, the idea of aggression being
impermissible immediately implies (<em>prima facie</em>) self-ownership.
In the case of external objects, however, we must identify who the owner
of the object is before we can determine what uses of it constitute
aggression.</p>
<p>As in the case with bodies, humans need to be able to use external
objects as means to achieve various ends. Because these things are
scarce (rivalrous), there is also the potential for conflict. And, as in
the case with bodies, libertarians favor assigning property rights so as
to permit the peaceful, conflict-free, productive use of such resources.
Thus, as in the case with bodies, property is assigned to the person
with the best claim or link to a given scarce resource—with the “best
claim” standard based on the shared <em>grundnorms</em> of permitting
peaceful, cooperative, conflict-free human interaction and use of
resources.</p>
<p>Unlike human bodies, however, external objects are not parts of one’s
identity, are not directly controlled by one’s will,
and—significantly—they are <em>initially unowned</em>.<a href="#fn759"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref759" role="doc-noteref"><sup>759</sup></a>
Here, the relevant objective link is <em>appropriation</em>—the
transformation, possession, or embordering of a previously unowned
resource, i.e., Lockean homesteading.<a href="#fn760"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref760" role="doc-noteref"><sup>760</sup></a>
Under this approach, the first (prior) user of a previously unowned
thing has a <em>prima facie</em> better claim than a second (later)
claimant solely by virtue of his being earlier.</p>
<p>Why is appropriation the relevant link for determination of
ownership? First, keep in mind that the question with respect to such
scarce resources is: who is the resource’s <em>owner</em>? Recall that
ownership is the <em>right</em> to control, use, or possess,<a
href="#fn761" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref761"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>761</sup></a> while possession is
<em>actual</em> control—“the <em>factual</em> authority that a person
exercises over a corporeal thing.”<a href="#fn762" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref762" role="doc-noteref"><sup>762</sup></a> The question is not
who has physical possession, it is who has ownership. Asking who is the
owner of a resource presupposes a crucial <em>distinction</em> between
ownership and possession—between the right to control and actual
control. And the answer has to take into account the nature of
previously unowned things—namely, that they must at some point<br />
become owned by a first owner to become goods at all.</p>
<p>The answer must also take into account the presupposed goals of those
seeking this answer: rules that permit conflict-free use of resources.
For this reason, the answer cannot be whoever <em>has the</em>
<em>resource or whoever is able to take it</em> is its owner. To hold
such a view is to endorse might-makes-right, where ownership collapses
into possession for want of a distinction.<a href="#fn763"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref763" role="doc-noteref"><sup>763</sup></a>
Such a system, far from avoiding conflict, makes conflict inevitable.<a
href="#fn764" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref764"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>764</sup></a></p>
<p>An aspect of ownership and property rights that is not often made
explicit is what has been called the “prior-later distinction.” This is
the idea that it <em>makes a difference</em> who came first.<a
href="#fn765" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref765"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>765</sup></a> The prior-later distinction is
implicit in the very idea of ownership, as the owner has a better
claim—again, <em>prima facie</em>—to his resource than “latecomers.”<a
href="#fn766" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref766"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>766</sup></a> If the owner did not have a better
claim to the resource than someone who just comes later and physically
wrests it from him, then he is not an owner, but merely the current user
or possessor, and we are operating under the amoral might-makes-right
principle instead of property rights and ownership.</p>
<p>More generally, latecomers’ claims are inferior to those of prior
possessors or claimants, who either homesteaded the resource or who can
trace their title back to the homesteader or earlier owner.<a
href="#fn767" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref767"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>767</sup></a> The crucial importance of the
prior-later distinction to libertarian theory is the reason Professor
Hoppe repeatedly emphasizes it in his writing.<a href="#fn768"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref768"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>768</sup></a></p>
<p>To sum up, the libertarian position on property rights is that in
order to permit conflict-free, productive use of scarce resources,
property titles to particular resources are assigned to particular
owners. As noted above, however, the title assignment must not be
random, arbitrary, or particularistic; instead, it has to be assigned
based on “the existence of an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable
link between owner” and the resource claimed.<a href="#fn769"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref769" role="doc-noteref"><sup>769</sup></a>
As can be seen from the considerations presented above, the link is the
physical transformation or embordering by the original homesteader, or a
contractual chain of title traceable back to him (or to some previous
possessor whose claim no one else can defeat).<a href="#fn770"

<h5 id="e.-consistency-and-principle"><em>E. Consistency and
Principle</em></h5>
<p>Most people give some weight to some of the above considerations. In
their eyes, a person is the owner of his own body—usually. A homesteader
owns the resource he appropriates—unless the state takes it from him “by
operation of law.”<a href="#fn771" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref771"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>771</sup></a> This is the principal distinction
between libertarians and typical non-libertarians (excluding criminals,
sociopaths, tyrants, government leaders, and so on): libertarians are
consistently opposed to aggression, defined in terms of invasion of
property borders, where property rights are understood to be assigned on
the basis of self-ownership in the case of bodies. And in the case of
non-bodily external objects, rights are understood on the basis of prior
possession or homesteading and contractual transfer of title.</p>
<p>This framework for rights is motivated by the libertarian’s
consistent and principled valuing of peaceful interaction and
cooperation—in short, of civilized behavior. Consider the Misesian view
of human action. According to Mises, human action is aimed at
alleviating some <em>felt uneasiness</em>.<a href="#fn772"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref772" role="doc-noteref"><sup>772</sup></a>
Thus, the actor employs scarce means, according to his understanding of
causal laws, to achieve various ends—ultimately, the removal of
uneasiness.</p>
<p>Just as felt uneasiness in general is the cause of action aimed at
alleviating it, a certain type of “moral” uneasiness gives rise to the
practice of normative justification aimed at its alleviation. To-wit,
civilized man (evidently) feels morally uneasy at the prospect of
violent struggles with others. On the one hand, he wants, for some
practical reason, to control a given scarce resource and to use violence
against another person, if necessary, to achieve this control. On the
other hand, he also wants to avoid a wrongful use of force. Civilized
man, for some reason, feels reluctance and uneasiness at the prospect of
conflict or violent interaction with his fellow man. Perhaps he is
reluctant to violently clash with others over certain objects because he
has empathy with them.<a href="#fn773" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref773" role="doc-noteref"><sup>773</sup></a> Perhaps the instinct
to cooperate is a result of social evolution. As Mises noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are people whose only aim is to improve the condition of their
own ego. There are other people with whom awareness of the troubles of
their fellow men causes as much uneasiness as or even more uneasiness
than their own wants.<a href="#fn774" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref774"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>774</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the reason, because of this uneasiness, when there is the
potential for violent conflict, the civilized man <em>seeks
justification</em> for the use of force or violence to control or defend
the use of a desired scarce resource that some other person opposes or
threatens. Empathy—or whatever spurs man to adopt the libertarian
<em>grundnorms</em>—gives rise to a certain form of uneasiness, which
gives rise to the attempt to justify violent action.</p>
<p>Civilized man may be thus defined as <em>he who seeks justification
for the use of interpersonal violence</em>. When the inevitable need to
engage in violence arises—for defense of life or property—civilized man
seeks justification. Naturally, since this justification-seeking is done
by people who are inclined to reason and peace (justification is after
all a peaceful activity that necessarily takes place during
discourse),<a href="#fn775" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref775"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>775</sup></a> what they seek are rules that are
fair, potentially acceptable to all relevant parties, grounded in the
nature of things, and universalizable, and which permit conflict-free
use of resources.</p>
<p>As noted in foregoing sections, libertarian property rights
principles emerge as the only candidate that satisfies these criteria.
We favor <em>prima facie</em> self-ownership of bodies as the only fair
and justifiable body ownership rule that permits conflict-free use of
the resources of our bodies. And in the case of resources external to
human bodies, we favor property rights on the basis of prior possession
or homesteading and contractual transfer of title. That is, the
libertarian position on property rights in external objects is that in
any dispute or contest over any particular scarce resource, the original
homesteader—the person who appropriated the resource from its unowned
status by embordering or transforming it (or his contractual
transferee)—has a better claim than latecomers, those who did not
appropriate the scarce resource. This is the only fair and justifiable
property assignment rule that permits harmonious, productive,
conflict-free use of such external scarce resources.</p>
<p>Thus, if civilized man is he who seeks justification for the use of
violence, the libertarian is he who is <em>serious</em> about this
endeavor. He has a deep, principled, innate opposition to violence and
an equally deep commitment to peace and cooperation.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, libertarianism may be said to be the
political philosophy that <em>consistently</em> favors social rules
aimed at promoting peace, prosperity, and cooperation.<a href="#fn776"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref776" role="doc-noteref"><sup>776</sup></a>
It recognizes that the only rules that are compatible with the
<em>grundnorms</em> of civilized men are the self-ownership principle
and the Lockean homesteading principle, applied as consistently as
possible.</p>
<h5 id="f.-the-state"><em>F. The State</em></h5>
<p>Libertarians oppose all forms of crime (aggression). Thus we oppose
not only private aggression: we also oppose <em>institutionalized</em>
or public aggression. The opposition to institutionalized aggression is
based on the view, espoused by Bastiat, that an act of aggression that
is unjust for a private actor to perform remains illegitimate when
performed by agencies, institutions, or collectives.<a href="#fn777"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref777" role="doc-noteref"><sup>777</sup></a>
Murder or theft by ten, or a hundred, or a million, people is not better
than theft by a lone criminal. It is for this reason that libertarians
view the state itself as inherently criminal. For the state does not
just happen to engage in institutionalized aggression; it necessarily
does so on a systematic basis as part of the very nature of the state.
As Hoppe notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What must an agent be able to do to qualify as a state? This agent
must be able to insist that all conflicts among the inhabitants of a
given territory be brought to him for ultimate decision-making or be
subject to his final review. In particular, this agent must be able to
insist that all conflicts involving himself be adjudicated by him or his
agent. And implied in the power to exclude all others from acting as
ultimate judge, as the second defining characteristic of a state, is the
agent’s power to tax: to unilaterally determine the price that justice
seekers must pay for his services.<a href="#fn778" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref778" role="doc-noteref"><sup>778</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an agency necessarily commits aggression against either human
bodies or owned property (usually both), either by taxing or by
outlawing competition (usually both).<a href="#fn779"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref779" role="doc-noteref"><sup>779</sup></a>
For these reasons, the consistent libertarian, in opposing aggression,
is also anarchist.<a href="#fn780" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref780"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>780</sup></a></p>
<p>This also implies that legislation is illegitimate—as legislation
requires a state—and that a law that is purely a result of legislation,
and that cannot emerge in a decentralized legal order, is also
invalid.<a href="#fn781" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref781"

<h4 id="iii.-libertarianism-applied-to-ip">III. LIBERTARIANISM APPLIED
TO IP</h4>
<p>Given the foregoing libertarian (and Austrian-economics-informed)
understanding of property rights, it is clear that the institutions of
patent and copyright are simply indefensible. Here is why.</p>
<p>Copyrights pertain to “original works,” such as books, articles,
movies, and computer programs. They are grants by the state that permit
the copyright holder to prevent others from using their own
property—e.g., ink and paper—in certain ways. Thus copyright literally
results in censorship—not surprising given its origins in suppressing
the spread of ideas not favored by crown and church.<a href="#fn782"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref782" role="doc-noteref"><sup>782</sup></a>
For example, shortly before his death, author J.D. Salinger, author of
<em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, convinced U.S. courts to actually ban the
publication of a novel called <em>60 Years Later: Coming Through the
Rye</em>, based on copyright claims. And when a grocery store in Canada
mistakenly sold 14 copies of a new Harry Potter book a few days before
its official release on Saturday, July 16, 2005, a Canadian judge
“ordered customers not to talk about the book, copy it, sell it or even
read it before it is officially released at 12:01 a.m. July 16.”<a
href="#fn783" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref783"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>783</sup></a></p>
<p>Patents grant rights in “inventions”—useful machines or processes.
They are grants by the state that permit the patentee to use the state’s
court system to prohibit others from using their <em>own property</em>
in certain ways—from reconfiguring their property according to a certain
pattern or design described in the patent, or from using their property
(including their own bodies) in a certain sequence of steps described in
the patent.<a href="#fn784" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref784"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>784</sup></a></p>
<p>Both patent and copyright are simply state grants of monopoly
privilege. In both cases, the state is assigning to <em>A</em> a right
to control <em>B</em>’s property: <em>A</em> can force <em>B</em> not to
engage in certain actions with <em>B</em>’s resources. Since ownership
is the right to control, IP grants to <em>A</em> a co-ownership right (a
negative servitude) in <em>B</em>’s property.<a href="#fn785"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref785" role="doc-noteref"><sup>785</sup></a>
This clearly cannot be justified under libertarian principles.
<em>B</em> already owns his property. With respect to him, <em>A</em> is
a latecomer. <em>B</em> is the one who appropriated the property, not
<em>A</em>. It is too late for <em>A</em> to homestead the resource in
question—<em>B</em>, or his ancestor in title, already did that. The
resource is no longer unowned. Granting <em>A</em> ownership rights in
<em>B</em>’s property is quite obviously incompatible with basic
libertarian principles. It is nothing more than redistribution of
wealth. IP is therefore unlibertarian and unjustified.</p>
<p>Why, then, is this a contested issue? Why do some libertarians still
believe in IP rights?</p>
<p>There are various arguments advanced for IP. Professor Nance notes
that IP arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… generally fall into two broad categories, deontological and
consequentialist. The latter category embraces all theories that purport
to justify property rights on the basis of the <em>good
consequences</em> of their legal recognition, as distinct from their
<em>moral rightness</em>.<a href="#fn786" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref786" role="doc-noteref"><sup>786</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consequentialist approach is implied by the Constitution’s
authorization for IP law, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Congress shall have power … To promote the progress of science
and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors
the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.<a
href="#fn787" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref787"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>787</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nance argues that most deontological arguments for IP—which fall into
the “moral rights” tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… fall into one of two sub-categories. First, they can be based upon
the creator’s deserving to own the fruits of her labors. This “labor
theory” of property is generally associated with John Locke, whose
influence on American thought is undeniable. An alternative theory, less
familiar to Anglo-American thought, is that such rights are based upon
respecting the creator’s extension or reification of personality by the
occupation of tangible or intangible things. The “personality theory” of
property is most commonly attributed to the German philosopher Hegel and
is better established in continental law.<a href="#fn788"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref788"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>788</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequentialist (incentive-based) arguments also have two major
sub-categories: utilitarianism (maximizing preference satisfaction by
incentives) and teleology (using incentives to pursue values that
deserve government support or encouragement). There are also other
theories, sometimes overlapping with each other, such as contract-based
arguments and those related to fairness, welfare, and culture.<a
href="#fn789" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref789"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>789</sup></a> I will address and criticize some
of these arguments in the following sections.</p>
<h5 id="a.-utilitarianism"><em>A. Utilitarianism</em></h5>
<p>One reason many libertarians favor IP is that is that they approach
libertarianism from a utilitarian perspective instead of a principled
one. They favor laws that increase general utility, or wealth. And they
believe the state’s propaganda that state-granted IP rights actually do
increase general wealth.</p>
<p>The utilitarian perspective itself is bad enough, because all sorts
of terrible policies could be justified this way: why not take half of
Henry Ford’s fortune and give it to the poor? Wouldn’t the total welfare
gains to the thousands of recipients be greater than Ford’s reduced
utility? After all, he would still be a billionaire afterwards. To take
another example: if a man is extremely desperate for sex, could not his
gain be greater than the loss suffered by his rape victim (say, if she
is a prostitute), thus justifying rape, in some cases, on utilitarian
grounds? Most people will recognize that there is something wrong with
utilitarian reasoning if it could lead to such results.</p>
<p>But even if we ignore the ethical and methodological problems<a
href="#fn790" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref790"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>790</sup></a> with the utilitarian or
wealth-maximization approach, what is bizarre is that utilitarian
libertarians are in favor of IP when they have not demonstrated that IP
does increase overall wealth. They merely assume that it does and then
base their policy views on this assumption.</p>
<p>It is beyond dispute that the IP system imposes significant costs, in
monetary terms alone, not to mention costs in terms of liberty.<a
href="#fn791" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref791"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>791</sup></a> The usual argument, that the
incentive provided by IP law stimulates additional innovation and
creativity, has not even been proven.<a href="#fn792"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref792" role="doc-noteref"><sup>792</sup></a>
It is entirely possible (even likely, in my view) that the IP system not
only imposes many billions of dollars of cost on society but actually
impedes innovation, adding damage to injury.</p>
<p>But even if we assume that the IP system does stimulate some
additional, valuable innovation, no one has established that the value
of the purported gains is greater than the costs.<a href="#fn793"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref793" role="doc-noteref"><sup>793</sup></a>
If one asks advocates of IP how they know there is a net gain, the
result is silence (this is especially true of patent attorneys). They
cannot point to any study to support their utilitarian contention; they
usually just point to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution (if they
are even aware of it), as if the backroom dealings of politicians two
centuries ago are some sort of empirical evidence in favor of state
grants of monopoly privilege.</p>
<p>In fact, as far as I am able to tell, <em>every</em> study that
attempts to tally the costs and benefits of copyright or patent law
concludes either that these schemes cost more than they are worth, that
they actually reduce innovation, or that the research is inconclusive.
There are no studies unambiguously showing a net societal gain.<a
href="#fn794" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref794"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>794</sup></a> There are only repetitions of
state propaganda.</p>
<p>The Founders only had a hunch that copyrights and patents might
“promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts”<a href="#fn795"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref795"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>795</sup></a>—that the cost of this system would
be “worth it.” But they had no serious evidence. A hundred and fifty
years later there was still none. In an exhaustive 1958 study prepared
for the U.S. Senate Subcommittee On Patents, Trademarks &amp;
Copyrights, economist Fritz Machlup concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No economist, on the basis of present knowledge, could possibly state
with certainty that the patent system, as it now operates, confers a net
benefit or a net loss upon society. The best he can do is to state
assumptions and make guesses about the extent to which reality
corresponds to these assumptions… If we did not have a patent system, it
would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present knowledge of its
economic consequences, to recommend instituting one.<a href="#fn796"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref796"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>796</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the empirical case for patents has not been shored up at all in
the last fifty years. As George Priest wrote in 1986, “[I]n the current
state of knowledge, economists know almost nothing about the effect on
social welfare of the patent system or of other systems of intellectual
property.”<a href="#fn797" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref797"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>797</sup></a> Similar comments are echoed by
other researchers. François Lévêque and Yann Ménière, for example, of
the Ecole des Mines de Paris (an engineering university), observed in
2004:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The abolition or preservation of intellectual property protection is…
not just a purely theoretical question. To decide on it from an economic
viewpoint, we must be able to assess all the consequences of protection
and determine whether the total favorable effects for society outweigh
the total negative effects. Unfortunately, this exercise [an economic
analysis of the cost and benefits of intellectual property] is no more
within our reach today than it was in Machlup’s day [1950s].<a
href="#fn798" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref798"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>798</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently, Boston University Law School Professors (and
economists) Michael Meurer and Jim Bessen conclude that on average, the
patent system discourages innovation. As they write: “[I]t seems
unlikely that patents today are an effective policy instrument to
encourage innovation overall” (p. 216). To the contrary, it seems clear
that nowadays, “patents place a drag on innovation” (p. 146). In short,
“the patent system fails on its own terms” (p. 145).<a href="#fn799"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref799"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>799</sup></a></p>
<p>And in a recent paper, economists Boldrin and Levine state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The case against patents can be summarized briefly: there is no
empirical evidence that they serve to increase innovation and
productivity…. This disconnect is at the root of what is called the
“patent puzzle”: in spite of the enormous increase in the number of
patents and in the strength of their legal protection, the US economy
has seen neither a dramatic acceleration in the rate of technological
progress nor a major increase in the levels of research and development
expenditure…</p>
<p>Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely to find
other legislative instruments, less open to lobbying and rent seeking,
to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire
undersupplies it.<a href="#fn800" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref800"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>800</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Founders’ hunch about IP was wrong. Copyright and patent are not
necessary for creative or artistic works, invention, and innovation.
They do not even encourage it. These monopoly privileges enrich some at
the expense of others, distort the market and culture, and impoverish us
all.<a href="#fn801" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref801"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>801</sup></a> Given the available evidence,
anyone who accepts utilitarianism should be <em>opposed</em> to patent
and copyright.<a href="#fn802" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref802"

<h5 id="b.-libertarian-creationism803"><em>B. Libertarian
Creationism</em><a href="#fn803" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref803"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>803</sup></a></h5>
<p>Another reason why many libertarians favor IP is their confusion
about the origin of property and property rights. They accept the
careless observation that an individual can come to own things in three
ways: through homesteading an unowned thing, by contractual exchange,
and by creation. Therefore, they reason, if you own what you create,
this is especially true for useful ideas. For example, libertarian
philosopher Tibor Machan has stated: “[I]t would seem that so called
intellectual stuff is an even better candidate for qualifying as private
property than is, say, a tree or mountain.”<a href="#fn804"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref804" role="doc-noteref"><sup>804</sup></a>
And Objectivist philosopher David Kelley writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he essential basis of property rights lies in the phenomenon of
creating value… [F]or things that one has created, such as a new
product, one’s act of creation is the source of the right, regardless of
scarcity.<a href="#fn805" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref805"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>805</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mistake is the notion that creation is an independent source of
ownership, independent from homesteading and contracting. Yet it is easy
to see that “creation” is neither necessary nor sufficient as a source
of ownership. If you carve a statue using your own hunk of marble, you
own the resulting creation because you already owned the marble. You
owned it before, and you own it now.<a href="#fn806"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref806" role="doc-noteref"><sup>806</sup></a>
And if you homestead an unowned resource, such as a field, by using it
and thereby establishing publicly visible borders, you own it because
this first use and embordering gives you a better claim than
latecomers.<a href="#fn807" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref807"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>807</sup></a> Thus, creation is not necessary
for ownership to arise.</p>
<p>But suppose you carve a statue in someone else’s marble, either
without permission or with permission, such as when an employee works
with his employer’s marble by contract. You do not own the resulting
statue, even though you “created” it. If you are using marble stolen
from another person, your vandalizing it does not take away the owner’s
claims to it. And if you are working on your employer’s marble, he owns
the resulting statue. Thus, creation is not sufficient for ownership
rights to arise.</p>
<p>This is not to deny the importance of knowledge, or creation and
innovation. Human action, which necessarily employs (ownable) scarce
means, is also <em>informed</em> by technical knowledge of causal laws
or other practical information. An actor’s knowledge, beliefs and values
affect the ends he chooses to pursue and the causal means he selects to
achieve the end sought (as discussed further in the next section).</p>
<p>It is true that creation is an important means of increasing
<em>wealth</em>. As Hoppe has observed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One can acquire and increase wealth either through homesteading,
<em>production</em> and contractual exchange, or by expropriating and
exploiting homesteaders, producers, or contractual exchangers. There are
no other ways.<a href="#fn808" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref808"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>808</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While production or creation can certainly increase <em>wealth</em>,
it is not an independent source of ownership or rights. Production is
not the creation of new matter; it is the transformation of things from
one form to another—the transformation of things someone already owns,
either the producer or someone else. Using your labor and creativity to
transform your property into more valuable finished products gives you
greater wealth, but not additional property rights.<a href="#fn809"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref809" role="doc-noteref"><sup>809</sup></a>
(If you transform someone else’s property, he owns the resulting
transformed thing, even if it is now more valuable.)</p>
<p>In other words, creation is not the basis for property rights in
scarce goods. Creating something does not make you its owner. A mother
who creates a child does not own it. A vandal who creates a mural on
someone else’s property does not own it. An employee who creates a
consumer device using his employer’s facilities and materials does not
own it. Creation is not sufficient to generate rights. And those who
transform their own property to create a more valuable product own the
resulting product because they already owned the original material, not
because of creation. The creator of an idea does not thereby own the
idea.<a href="#fn810" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref810"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>810</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="c.-the-contractual-approach"><em>C. The Contractual
Approach</em></h5>
<p>Many libertarians also argue that some form of copyright or patent
could be created by contractual techniques—for example, by selling a
patterned medium (book, CD, etc.) or useful machine to a buyer on the
condition that it not be copied or revealed to others. For example,
Brown sells an innovative mousetrap to Green on the condition that Green
not reproduce it.<a href="#fn811" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref811"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>811</sup></a></p>
<p>For such contractual IP to emulate statutory IP, however, it has to
bind not only seller and buyer, but all third parties. The contract
between buyer and seller cannot do this—it binds only the buyer and
seller. In the example given above, even if Green agrees not to copy
Brown’s mousetrap, Black has no agreement with Brown. Brown has no
contractual right to prevent Black from using Black’s own property in
accordance with whatever knowledge or information Black has.</p>
<p>Now if Green were to sell Brown’s watch to Black without Brown’s
permission, most libertarians would say that Brown still owns the watch
and could take it from Black. Why doesn’t a similar logic apply in the
case of the mousetrap design?</p>
<p>The difference is that the watch is a scarce resource that has an
owner, while the mousetrap design is merely information, which is not a
type of thing that can be owned. The watch is a scarce resource still
owned by Brown. Black needs Brown’s consent to use it. But in the
mousetrap case, Black merely learns how to make a mousetrap. He uses
this information to make a mousetrap, by means of his own body and
property. He doesn’t need Brown’s permission, simply because he is not
using Brown’s property.</p>
<p>The IP advocate thus has to say that Brown owns the information about
how his mousetrap is configured. This move is question begging, however,
since it asserts what is to be shown: that there are intellectual
property rights.</p>
<p>If Black does not return Green’s watch, Green is without his watch
precisely because the watch is a scarce good. But Black’s knowing how to
make a mousetrap does not take away Green’s own mousetrap-making
knowledge, highlighting the nonscarce nature of information or patterns.
In short, Brown may retake his property from Black but has no right to
prevent Black from using information to guide his actions. Thus, the
contract approach fails as well.<a href="#fn812" class="footnote-ref"

<h5 id="d.-learning-emulation-and-knowledge-in-human-action"><em>D.
Learning, Emulation, and Knowledge in Human Action</em></h5>
<p>Another way to understand the error in treating information, ideas,
recipes, and patterns as ownable property is to consider IP in the
context of human action. Mises explains that “[t]o act means: to strive
after ends, that is, to choose a goal and to resort to means in order to
attain the goal sought.”<a href="#fn813" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref813" role="doc-noteref"><sup>813</sup></a> Knowledge and
information of course play a key role in action as well. As Mises puts
it, “Action … is not simply behavior, but behavior begot by judgments of
value, aiming at a definite end and <em>guided by ideas concerning the
suitability or unsuitability of definite means</em>.”<a href="#fn814"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref814"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>814</sup></a></p>
<p>Rothbard further elaborates on the importance of knowledge to
<em>guide</em> actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is another unique type of factor of production that is
indispensable in every stage of every production process. This is the
“technological idea” of how to proceed from one stage to another and
finally to arrive at the desired consumers’ good. This is but an
application of the analysis above, namely, that for any action, there
must be some <em>plan</em> or idea of the actor about how to use things
as means, as definite pathways, to desired ends. Without such plans or
ideas, there would be no action. These plans may be called
<em>recipes</em>; they are ideas of recipes that the actor uses to
arrive at his goal. A <em>recipe</em> must be present at each stage of
each production process from which the actor proceeds to a later stage.
The actor must have a recipe for transforming iron into steel, wheat
into flour, bread and ham into sandwiches, etc.<a href="#fn815"

<p>Moreover, “[m]eans are necessarily always limited, i.e. scarce, with
regard to the services for which man wants to use them.”<a href="#fn816"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref816" role="doc-noteref"><sup>816</sup></a>
This is why property rights emerged. Use of a resource by one person
excludes use by another. Property rights are assigned to scarce
resources to permit them to be used productively and cooperatively, and
to permit conflict to be avoided. In contrast, ownership of the
information that guides action is not necessary. For example, two people
who each own the ingredients (scarce goods) can simultaneously make a
cake with the same recipe.</p>
<p>Material progress is made over time because information is
<em>not</em> scarce. It can be infinitely multiplied, learned, taught,
and built on. The more patterns, recipes, and causal laws that are
known, the greater the wealth multiplier as individuals engage in
ever-more efficient and productive actions. It is <em>good</em> that
ideas are infinitely reproducible. There is no need to impose artificial
scarcity on ideas to make them more like physical resources,
which—unfortunately—<em>are</em> scarce.<a href="#fn817"

<h5 id="e.-ip-legislation-and-the-state"><em>E. IP, Legislation, and the
State</em></h5>
<p>A final problem with IP remains: patent and copyright are statutory
schemes, schemes that can be constructed only by legislation, and
therefore <em>have always</em> been constructed by legislation. A patent
or copyright code could no more arise in the decentralized, case-based
legal system of a free society than could the Americans with
Disabilities Act or Medicare. IP requires both a legislature and a
state. For libertarians who reject the legitimacy of the state,<a
href="#fn818" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref818"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>818</sup></a> or legislated law,<a href="#fn819"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref819" role="doc-noteref"><sup>819</sup></a>
this is the final nail in the IP coffin.</p>
<h4 id="iv.-imagining-an-ip-free-world">IV. IMAGINING AN IP-FREE
WORLD</h4>
<p>It is fairly straightforward to explain what is wrong with IP: patent
and copyright are artificial state-granted monopoly privileges that
undercut and invade property rights, as elaborated above. But the
consequentialist and utilitarian mindset is so entrenched that even
people who see the ethical problems with IP law sometimes demand that
the IP opponent explain how innovation would be funded in an IP-free
world. How would authors make money? How would blockbuster movies be
funded? Why would anyone invent if they could not get a patent? How
could companies afford to develop pharmaceuticals if they had to face
competition?</p>
<p>When I see such demands and questions, I am reminded of John Hasnas’s
comments in his classic article “The Myth of the Rule of Law.”<a
href="#fn820" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref820"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>820</sup></a> After arguing against the state
and for anarchy, Hasnas observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would a free market in legal services be like?</p>
<p>I am always tempted to give the honest and accurate response to this
challenge, which is that to ask the question is to miss the point. If
human beings had the wisdom and knowledge-generating capacity to be able
to describe how a free market would work, that would be the strongest
possible argument for central planning. One advocates a free market not
because of some moral imprimatur written across the heavens, but because
it is impossible for human beings to amass the knowledge of local
conditions and the predictive capacity necessary to effectively organize
economic relationships among millions of individuals. It is possible to
describe what a free market in shoes would be like <em>because we have
one</em>. But such a description is merely an observation of the current
state of a functioning market, not a projection of how human beings
would organize themselves to supply a currently non-marketed good. To
demand that an advocate of free market law (or Socrates of Monosizea,
for that matter) describe in advance how markets would supply legal
services (or shoes) is to issue an impossible challenge. Further, for an
advocate of free market law (or Socrates) to even accept this challenge
would be to engage in self-defeating activity since the more
successfully he or she could describe how the law (or shoe) market would
function, the more he or she would prove that it could be run by state
planners. Free markets supply human wants better than state monopolies
precisely because they allow an unlimited number of suppliers to attempt
to do so. By patronizing those who most effectively meet their
particular needs and causing those who do not to fail, consumers
determine the optimal method of supply. If it were possible to specify
in advance what the outcome of this process of selection would be, there
would be no need for the process itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: the answer such a challenge might be, as Leonard Read
said, “I don’t know.”<a href="#fn821" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref821"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>821</sup></a></p>
<p>To return to the current subject: with the advent of state IP
legislation, the state has interrupted and preempted whatever other
customs, business arrangements, contractual regimes and practices, and
so on, that would no doubt have arisen in its absence. So it is natural
for those accustomed to IP to be a bit nervous about replacing the
current flawed IP system with… a vacuum. It is natural for them to
wonder, “Well, what would occur in its absence?” As noted above, the
reason we are not sure what an IP-free world would look like is that the
state has snuffed out alternative institutions and practices.</p>
<p>Consider the analogous situation in which the FCC preempted and
monopolized the field of property rights in airwaves just as they were
starting to develop in the common law. Nowadays people are used to the
idea of the state regulating and parceling out airwave or spectrum
rights and might imagine there would be chaos if the FCC were abolished.
Still, we have some idea as to what property rights might emerge in
airwaves absent central state involvement.<a href="#fn822"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref822"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>822</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, because people are bound to ask the inevitable: we IP
opponents try to come up with some predictions and solutions and
answers. Thus, in the end we must agree with Hasnas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although I am tempted to give this response, I never do. This is
because, although true, it never persuades. Instead, it is usually
interpreted as an appeal for blind faith in the free market, and the
failure to provide a specific explanation as to how such a market would
provide legal services is interpreted as proof that it cannot.
Therefore, despite the self-defeating nature of the attempt, I usually
do try to suggest how a free market in law might work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how would content creators be rewarded in an IP-free market?
First, we must recognize that what advocates of IP want is a world where
competition is tamed. Their view is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments adopt intellectual property laws in the belief that a
privileged, monopolistic domain operating on the margins of the
free-market economy promotes long-term cultural and technological
progress better than a regime of <em>unbridled competition</em>.<a
href="#fn823" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref823"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>823</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, they favor the grant of monopolies by the state that shelter
various market actors from competition. But in a free society with no IP
rights, content creators and innovators would face competition just as
others do.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that the position of the creator of content
that is easily copied or imitated is no different in kind from that of
any other entrepreneur on the market. Every producer faces competition.
If a given entrepreneur makes profit, competitors notice this and start
to compete, eroding the initial profits made. Thus market actors
continually seek to innovate and find new ways to please consumers in
the pursuit of elusive profits. Most producers face a variety of costs,
including costs of exclusion. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Movie theaters, for example, invest in exclusion devices like ticket
windows, walls, and ushers, all designed to exclude non-contributors
from enjoyment of service. Alternatively, of course, movie owners could
set up projectors and screens in public parks and then attempt to
prevent passers-by from watching, or they could ask government to force
all non-contributors to wear special glasses which prevent them from
enjoying the movie. “Drive-ins,” faced with the prospect of free riders
peering over the walls, installed—at considerable expense—individual
speakers for each car, thus rendering the publicly available visual part
of the movie of little interest …. The costs of exclusion are involved
in the production of virtually every good imaginable.<a href="#fn824"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref824"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>824</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that it is the responsibility of entrepreneurs
whose products are easily imitated to find a way to profit, and that
they may not use state force to stop competitors. In a sense, this is
already the situation facing content creators. Piracy is real and is not
going away, unless the big media special interests succeed in having the
Internet shut down. Even in the face of widespread file sharing and
disregard for copyright, creativity is at an all time high.<a
href="#fn825" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref825"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>825</sup></a> The only solution to piracy and
file sharing is to offer a better service.<a href="#fn826"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref826" role="doc-noteref"><sup>826</sup></a>
For example, offering DRM-free movies or music for a reasonable price,
as comedian Louis C.K. did, earning $1M in about two weeks.<a
href="#fn827" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref827"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>827</sup></a> Or use crowd-source fundraising
mechanisms like Kickstarter—computer game company Double Fine
Productions recently used Kickstarter to raise $400,000 to fund a new
adventure game ($300,000 for game development, and $100,000 to make a
documentary about the process). In fact, as of this writing, $1,095,783
had been raised, from 28,921 backers, in <em>one day</em>.<a
href="#fn828" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref828"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>828</sup></a></p>
<p>And there are a variety of tactics people can adopt in different
industries. A singer or musician can garner fans from his recordings,
even if they are distributed for free, and charge fees for concerts.
Movie studios can sell tickets to movies that have advantages over home
viewing, such as better sound, 3D, large screens, and the like. Most
non-fiction authors—such as bloggers or law professors publishing law
review articles for free—do not get paid now, but engage in this
activity to enhance their reputation and employability, for ad revenues,
or for other reasons. A novelist could become popular with her first few
books and then get fans to pre-purchase the sequel before releasing it
or get paid to be a consultant on/endorser of a movie version.<a
href="#fn829" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref829"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>829</sup></a></p>
<p>We cannot forecast all the ways human entrepreneurial creativity will
discover to profit and flourish in a free society with no state-granted
protections from competition. But there is every reason to think that in
a private-law society, we would be unimaginably richer and freer, with
more diversity and intellectual creativity than ever before. The state
is nothing but a hindrance to everything good about human society.</p>

15: <em>Against Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years: Looking
Back and Looking Forward</h3>
<p>This chapter is previously unpublished, other than a working draft
posted on c4sif.org. It provides a perspective on the IP debates since
my <em>Against Intellectual Property</em> (<em>AIP</em>) was published
in 2001, and provides an overview of newer arguments about IP that I’ve
made in the twenty-plus years since the publication of <em>AIP</em>. It
also discusses changes I would make to the original arguments presented
in <em>AIP</em>. This chapter complements chapter 14, which itself was
originally published about a decade after <em>AIP</em>.</p>
<h4 id="i.-background">I. BACKGROUND</h4>
<p><em>Against Intellectual Property</em> originated as a <em>Journal of
Libertarian Studies</em> article in 2001.<a href="#fn830"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref830" role="doc-noteref"><sup>830</sup></a>
At the time there was less interest among libertarians in the topic of
intellectual property (IP) than there is now. Libertarian attention was
more focused on issues such as taxes, war, central banking, the drug
war, government education, asset forfeiture, business regulations, civil
liberties, and so on. Not so much on patent and copyright, the two
primary forms of IP.</p>
<p>I had no reason to think it was an especially important issue, but I
had always been dissatisfied with various libertarian arguments for IP,
and it kept nagging at me throughout college and law school. Ayn Rand’s
brief article on patent and copyright, for example, included strained
arguments as to why a 17 year patent term and a life-plus-50 year
copyright term were just about right.<a href="#fn831"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref831" role="doc-noteref"><sup>831</sup></a>
She also offered a confused argument as to why it was fair for the first
guy to race to the patent office to get a monopoly that could be used
against an independent inventor just one day behind him.<a href="#fn832"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref832"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>832</sup></a></p>
<p>It made no sense to me and didn’t seem to fit in well with other
aspects of libertarian theory and individual rights. I believed Rand’s
approach was wrong, or at least flawed, since natural property rights
can’t expire at an arbitrary time, much less one decreed by legislation,
but I still assumed IP rights were, somehow, legitimate property rights.
Since I was increasingly interested in libertarian theory (my first
scholarly libertarian article was published in 1992)<a href="#fn833"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref833" role="doc-noteref"><sup>833</sup></a>
and was beginning to specialize in IP in my law practice (in 1993),<a
href="#fn834" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref834"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>834</sup></a> I figured that I might be able to
come up with a better defense of IP than previous libertarians had
managed, since most of them really didn’t have a good grasp of how
actual patent and copyright law worked. So I dove deep into the
literature and tried to find a way to justify IP rights, only to keep
hitting dead ends.<a href="#fn835" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref835"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>835</sup></a> Every argument I could come up
with was as flawed and shaky as Ayn Rand’s.</p>
<p>And in my research I came across libertarian and other criticisms of
IP,<a href="#fn836" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref836"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>836</sup></a> and also deepened my understanding
of the crucial role of <em>scarcity</em> to property rights, as
emphasized in particular by Hans-Hermann Hoppe.<a href="#fn837"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref837" role="doc-noteref"><sup>837</sup></a>
I began to see that older criticisms of IP, such as the writings of
Benjamin Tucker, Wendy McElroy, Sam Konkin, and Tom Palmer, were
correct, even if their criticisms were not comprehensive or complete.<a
href="#fn838" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref838"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>838</sup></a> With a relief similar to the one I
felt when I finally gave up minarchism and ceded the ground to
anarchism, I finally concluded that patent and copyright are completely
statist and unjustified derogations from libertarian principles and
property rights. No wonder I had been failing in my attempts: I had been
trying to justify the unjustifiable!</p>
<p>So I sought to build on the work done by previous thinkers, and
clarify and expand it. I gave a few local talks and wrote some short
articles on the topic starting in 1995,<a href="#fn839"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref839" role="doc-noteref"><sup>839</sup></a>
often with a somewhat tentative tone as I was initially concerned that
publicly opposing IP law might harm my budding IP law practice (turns
out, it never caused a problem). I then wrote a lengthier treatment,
which became <em>AIP</em>, mostly to get it out of my system, intending
to then turn my attention back to other fields that interest me more,
like rights theory, contract theory, causation, and other aspects of
libertarian legal theory.<a href="#fn840" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref840" role="doc-noteref"><sup>840</sup></a></p>
<p>I presented the paper, then entitled “The Legitimacy of Intellectual
Property,” at the Ludwig von Mises Institute’s Austrian Scholars
Conference in March 2000. This was the year Objectivist George Reisman
started attending Mises Institute events, after having been ousted from
Objectivist circles over his favorable remarks about Barbara Branden’s
biography of Rand, and had reunited with his old friend Ralph Raico,
from whom he had been estranged for many years. I remember Reisman
asking me, after I delivered my paper, something like, “Let me make sure
I understand you. Are you saying all patent and copyright law should be
abolished?” I answered yes and, seeming somewhat stunned, he slowly
walked away. In any case, I submitted the paper to the <em>JLS</em>,
where it was published as “Against Intellectual Property,” a title
suggested by Professor Hans-Hermann Hoppe, then the journal’s
editor.</p>
<p><em>AIP</em>, and some other articles around the same time, argues
that all forms of intellectual property—including patent, copyright,
trademark, and trade secret, but especially the first two—are unjust and
unlibertarian laws and should be abolished.<a href="#fn841"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref841"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>841</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="ii.-the-internet-era-and-the-growing-ip-threat">II. THE INTERNET
ERA AND THE GROWING IP THREAT</h4>
<p>As noted above, IP had not received a great deal of attention from
libertarians before the internet era. But IP’s wallflower status was
about to change. Some were starting to sense that the IP issue was
becoming more important. The need to shine a light on patent and
copyright, heretofore relegated to the shadows and the bailiwick of
specialists, was becoming more apparent. An early sign of this among
Austro-libertarians, perhaps, was the Mises Institute’s awarding me the
O.P. Alford III Prize for 2002 for <em>AIP</em>.<a href="#fn842"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref842"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>842</sup></a></p>
<p>The Internet is the reason for IP emerging from the shadows. The
Internet—and digital information and file sharing, social media, and
related technologies like cell phones, texting, and ubiquitous video
cameras—was at this time gaining steam and becoming a huge social force.
It was becoming one of the most important tools to fight statism and to
preserve and extend human freedom and prosperity. And this is why it has
been under attack by the state, in the guise of anti-pornography,
anti-gambling, and anti-terrorism, as well as anti-piracy/copyright
protection efforts.</p>
<p>The Internet became the world’s biggest copying machine, leading to a
dramatic increase in the amount of copyright infringement, and thus in
the amount of copyright lawsuits and penalties.<a href="#fn843"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref843" role="doc-noteref"><sup>843</sup></a>
At the same time, news of shockingly excessive, absurd, and outrageous
copyright persecutions were instantly and widely communicated over the
Internet—college students and single mothers sued for millions of
dollars for sharing a few songs.<a href="#fn844" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref844" role="doc-noteref"><sup>844</sup></a> No longer were these
lawsuits hidden in the dark; Internet users were starting to be made
aware of them. Writes Siva Vaidhyanathan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1991 I noticed that [hip-hop] music had changed. The new work
lacked the texture and richness that had marked the finest albums of the
late 1980s, such as Public Enemy’s <em>It Takes a Nation of Millions to
Hold Us Back</em> and the Beastie Boys’s <em>Paul’s Boutique</em>.
Instead, the digital samples of others’ music that made up the intricate
bed of sound in those great albums was replaced by a thinner, less
interesting, less intricate collection of more obvious samples. The
language of sampling seemed to become simpler and less interesting.
There was less play and less depth to the music by 1992. I knew that
several hip-hop artists had faced copyright suits over sampling in 1990
and 1991. So I wondered if the law had had such a profound effect on the
art. After a bit of research, I concluded that it had. With a bit more
research, I sought to explain the larger, longer relationship between
copyright and creativity in American history. That project … became the
germ of my first book, published in 2001, <em>Copyrights and Copywrongs:
The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens
Creativity.</em></p>
<p>By 2001 copyright had exploded into public consciousness, largely
through the remarkable rise and fall of Napster, the first easy-to-use
digital file-sharing service. The United States had radically expanded
copyright law in the 1990s in anticipation of the “digital moment.” But
nothing had prepared the copyright industries for the torrent of
unauthorized peer-to-peer distribution over the Internet, starting in
about 2000. Meanwhile, computer software had blossomed from a mere hobby
to a multibillion-dollar global industry in the 1980s and 1990s without
any clear sense of how intellectual property would work for it (or
against it). At about the same time that U.S. courts ruled that software
could enjoy the protection of patent law as well as copyright, the
movement to lock computer code open for the benefit of security,
stability, quality, and creativity (and, to some, humanity) grew to be
called the “Free and Open-Source Software” movement. As someone thrown
into the copyright battles of the early twenty-first century despite my
training as a nineteenth-century cultural historian, I felt compelled to
make sense of these and other trends that were remaking our global
information ecosystem. Those interests are reflected in my second book,
published in 2004, <em>The Anarchist in the Library: How the Clash
between Freedom and Control Is Hacking the Real World and Crashing the
System</em>.</p>
<p>The copyright wars of the first decade of the twenty-first century
yielded a global “Free Culture” movement, with law professor Lawrence
Lessig as its intellectual leader. Globally, others concerned with
issues beyond copyright and creativity, including biopiracy and the cost
of pharmaceuticals in developing nations, launched the “Access to
Knowledge” movement. During the decade the industries devoted to
expanding and strengthening intellectual property succeeded in
legislatures and courts around the world. And the United States embedded
intellectual property standards into trade treaties with other nations.
The issues were becoming more interesting and important every week.</p>
<p>Then, in late 2004 Google announced it would begin to scan into
electronic form millions of books from dozens of university
libraries—many of which would still be covered by copyright. The ensuing
debate and lawsuits drew me into the fascinating world of search
engines, Internet policy, and the future of libraries and books. That
research generated my third book, published in 2011, <em>The
Googlization of Everything and Why We Should Worry.</em><a href="#fn845"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref845"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>845</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as Declan McCullogh writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few years, intellectual property has morphed from an
arcane topic of interest mostly to academicians and patent attorneys to
the stuff of newsmagazine cover stories. Courtrooms’ klieg lights have
illuminated how copyright law has been stretched in ways unimaginable
just five years ago. Software patents have roiled the computer industry
and alarmed developers of open-source programs. Meanwhile, displaying
all the temperance of a methadone addict, Congress keeps handing more
and more power to copyright owners.<a href="#fn846" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref846" role="doc-noteref"><sup>846</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patent outrages and abuse also increased along with a growing tech
sector and economy and were also communicated at light speed to blogs
and RSS feeds. And in the meantime the traditional
content-producers,<br />
ever-resistant to new technologies that disrupt comfortable, established
business models, kept lobbying Congress to ratchet up patent and
copyright scope and terms and penalties and enforcement,<a href="#fn847"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref847" role="doc-noteref"><sup>847</sup></a>
while at the same time the US bullied other countries to keep ratcheting
up their own IP laws and enforcement.<a href="#fn848"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref848" role="doc-noteref"><sup>848</sup></a>
This culminated in the attempt to<br />
enact anti-piracy legislation such as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)
and Protect IP Act (PIPA), which was—at least for the moment—derailed by
a historic Internet uprising.<a href="#fn849" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref849" role="doc-noteref"><sup>849</sup></a></p>
<p>For these reasons, in the last couple decades, as IP becomes a more
apparent threat to property rights, freedom of expression, and the
Internet, the issue became more prominent, and libertarians of various
stripes—Austrians, anarchists, left-libertarians, civil libertarians,
and the young and Internet dependent—started to become more interested
in the IP issue and more receptive to anti-IP arguments.<a href="#fn850"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref850" role="doc-noteref"><sup>850</sup></a>
And more and more libertarians are writing on this important topic and
building on, incorporating, or extending previous analyses, calling for
significant reform of IP law or even outright abolition.<a href="#fn851"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref851" role="doc-noteref"><sup>851</sup></a>
In addition, outside of libertarianism proper, a host of economists,
empirical researchers, and legal scholars, most notably economists
Michele Boldrin and David Levine, authors of the groundbreaking
<em>Against Intellectual Monopoly</em>, have expressed deep skepticism,
on empirical grounds, of the claimed pro-innovation effects of patent
and copyright.<a href="#fn852" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref852"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>852</sup></a></p>
<p>The issue continues to receive attention from a variety of
institutions and outlets. I have myself, lectured, debated, and been
interviewed countless times on this topic, including on the
<em>Stossel</em> show and the <em>Reason.tv</em>-sponsored Soho Forum
debate.<a href="#fn853" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref853"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>853</sup></a> I also gave a six-part lecture
course on IP for the Mises Academy in 2010 and reprised in 2011,<a
href="#fn854" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref854"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>854</sup></a> and I have continued to write on
this topic.<a href="#fn855" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref855"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>855</sup></a></p>
<p>What about the prospects for reform of patent and copyright law?
While more and more libertarians have come to see IP law as unjust, it
is unlikely there will be much legislative progress on this matter due
to widespread confusion about property rights and entrenched special
interests, in particular Hollywood and the American music industry,
which rely on copyright, and the pharmaceutical industry, which profits
from the patent system. That said, it seems unlikely that copyright
terms—once 14 years extendable to 28, and then life of the author plus
50 years, and now life of the author plus 70 years—will be extended any
further. And while patent and copyright law will stay on the books for a
long time, technology will make them increasingly harder to enforce.
Piracy of copyrighted works is already rampant due to the Internet and
encryption. As 3D printing technology advances, we may see an increased
ability of consumers to evade patent law as well.<a href="#fn856"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref856"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>856</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="iii.-changes">III. CHANGES</h4>
<p>I’ve been asked from time to time what changes I would make to
<em>AIP</em>. In my assessment, the basic arguments in <em>AIP</em> are
sound. I have yet to see a valid criticism.<a href="#fn857"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref857" role="doc-noteref"><sup>857</sup></a>
I might change the structure somewhat, or an emphasis or wording here
and there. For example, I would clarify that <em>scarcity</em> is meant
in the technical economics sense of rivalrousness.<br />
I might even propose the use of the term “conflictable,” to emphasize
the nature of resources that gives rise to property rights in the first
place, and to head off silly arguments like, “Well, IP is justified
since good ideas are scarce.”<a href="#fn858" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref858" role="doc-noteref"><sup>858</sup></a> Also, I might use
“corporeal” or “material” instead of “tangible.”<a href="#fn859"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref859" role="doc-noteref"><sup>859</sup></a>
I would try to be more careful to use the term <em>property</em> to
refer <em>not</em> to the owned resource that is the subject of property
rights, but only to the relationship between the owner and the resource
owned, although this can be tedious if overdone.<a href="#fn860"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref860" role="doc-noteref"><sup>860</sup></a>
I would streamline the initial section providing a positive legal

<h4 id="iv.-additions">IV. ADDITIONS</h4>
<p>But I would not change much, substantively speaking. However, since
writing <em>AIP</em> over 20 years ago, I have found additional ways of
explaining the fundamental problem with IP law—additional arguments,
examples, and evidence.<a href="#fn862" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref862" role="doc-noteref"><sup>862</sup></a> So I would add some
material, as I did to some degree in a later paper.<a href="#fn863"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref863" role="doc-noteref"><sup>863</sup></a>
I’ll briefly outline below some of the arguments developed after the
initial publication of <em>AIP</em>.</p>
<h5 id="a.-empirical-evidence"><em>A. Empirical Evidence</em></h5>
<p>In the “Utilitarian Defenses of IP” section of <em>AIP,</em> I
explained various defects in the utilitarian case for IP. First, as
Austrians have explained, value is not a measurable, cardinal quantity
that can be interpersonally compared.<a href="#fn864"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref864" role="doc-noteref"><sup>864</sup></a>
Second, even if violating someone’s rights by taking their resources and
redistributing them to someone else makes the recipient better off, it
is still a rights violation. And third, the proponent of IP, arguing
that IP laws lead to net utility gains, has the burden of proof.<a
href="#fn865" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref865"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>865</sup></a> And it has become increasingly
clearer, in the last 60+ years, that those arguing for IP on empirical
grounds have not yet satisfied and cannot satisfy their burden of proof
that IP makes us better off.<a href="#fn866" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref866" role="doc-noteref"><sup>866</sup></a> As I wrote in a
subsequent paper, “Given the available evidence, anyone who accepts
utilitarianism should be <em>opposed</em> to patent and copyright.”<a

Negative Easements</em><a href="#fn868" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref868" role="doc-noteref"><sup>868</sup></a></h5>
<p>Additionally, I have come to understand that IP rights can be
properly classified as <em>non-consensual negative easements</em> (or
servitudes),<a href="#fn869" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref869"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>869</sup></a> which makes plain exactly how they
infringe justly-acquired property rights.<a href="#fn870"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref870" role="doc-noteref"><sup>870</sup></a>
All property rights are enforceable rights in material,
scarce—conflictable—resources, the type of (causally efficacious) scarce
means that human actors can possess and manipulate and employ to
causally interfere in the world. It is not that assigning property
rights in information or knowledge is <em>wrong</em>, but that it is
<em>impossible</em>.<a href="#fn871" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref871"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>871</sup></a> Force cannot be applied to “ideas”
or information, but only to scarce resources. Any IP right is just a
disguised reassignment of property rights in existing scarce resources.
One reason for the confusion here is that people are not careful in
distinguishing between motivations and means.</p>
<p>For example, it is sometimes said that people “fight over religion.”
But this is not accurate. Religion is not a scarce resource over which
there can be conflict. Any interpersonal human conflict is
<em>always</em> over scarce, material, <em>conflictable</em> resources.
If <em>A</em> kills <em>B</em> or takes his land or cows in a religious
dispute, the religious disagreement is merely the <em>motivation</em> or
reason for the conflict or clash—the explanation for why parties act as
they do—but the clash itself is always over the material things that are
the real subject of property rights. We can <em>explain</em> a given
human action by reference to the ends aimed at and the means employed.
One’s motivations and goals factor into the ends; but the actual means
employed and the actions taken are what property rights concern.<a
href="#fn872" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref872"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>872</sup></a></p>
<p>All rights are human rights, and all human rights are property
rights,<a href="#fn873" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref873"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>873</sup></a> and property rights just are
rights to the exclusive control of certain conflictable resources.<a
href="#fn874" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref874"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>874</sup></a> In the end, every law, every
dispute, boils down to some actor being assigned ownership rights in a
given contested (conflictable) resource. A copyright grant gives the
holder a partial property right in the printing press and computers of
other people. A patent grant gives the holder a partial property right
in the factories and raw material already owned by others. Such rights
are negative easements that permit the holder to veto or prevent certain
uses by the owner. Negative easements are legitimate when consented to,
but in the case of IP, the state grants these rights to the IP holder
<em>without the consent</em> of the owner of the burdened property (the
so-called “servient estate”). As I noted in <em>AIP</em>, “ownership of
an idea, or ideal object, effectively gives the IP owners a property
right in every physical embodiment of that work or invention.”<a
href="#fn875" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref875"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>875</sup></a> Thus, IP rights amount to a taking
or infringement of property rights otherwise established in accordance
with the principles of original appropriation and contract.<a
href="#fn876" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref876"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>876</sup></a> This insight buttresses the
argument in <em>AIP</em> that “a system of property rights in ‘ideal
objects’ necessarily requires violation of other individual property
rights, e.g., to use one’s own tangible property as one sees fit.”<a

<p>In the “Creation vs. Scarcity” section of <em>AIP,</em> I pointed out
that one mistake made by many proponents of IP is the notion that
<em>creation is a source of property rights</em>. But it is not. I have
elaborated on this topic in subsequent writing, pointing out that
creation—i.e., production, transformation, or rearrangement<a
href="#fn879" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref879"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>879</sup></a> of existing resources—is a source
of <em>wealth</em> but not a source of property rights. After all,
transforming a set of input resources into a more valuable output
product requires that the input factors already be owned. The resulting
product is thus owned according to standard property rights and contract
principles.<a href="#fn880" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref880"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>880</sup></a></p>
<p>Property rights in one’s body are based in one’s direct control over
one’s body.<a href="#fn881" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref881"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>881</sup></a> Property rights in external,
previously unowned scarce resources come from original appropriation, or
homesteading—first use and transformation or embordering—of an
<em>unowned</em> scarce resource or by contractual transfer from a
previous owner.<a href="#fn882" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref882"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>882</sup></a> Production or transformation of
existing, already-owned resources may increase or create wealth, but is
not a source of rights. This is a common confusion among libertarians,
especially Randians and those influenced by the confused labor theory of
property and the related labor theory of value, as can be seen in
nonsensical sayings like, “You have a right to the fruits of your
labor.”<a href="#fn883" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref883"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>883</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="d.-the-labor-metaphor"><em>D. The Labor Metaphor</em></h5>
<p>Overreliance on “labor” metaphors also leads to confusion about IP.
Locke correctly argued that the first person to “mix his labor with” an
unowned resource owns it, since he thereby establishes an objective link
to the resource which gives him a better claim to it than latecomers.<a
href="#fn884" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref884"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>884</sup></a> However, Locke based his argument
on the confused and unnecessary idea that a person “owns” his labor and
“therefore” owns resources that he mixes it with. But labor is not
owned—it is an <em>action</em>, something a person performs with his
body, which he does own—and this assumption is not needed for the
Lockean labor-mixture argument to work.<a href="#fn885"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref885" role="doc-noteref"><sup>885</sup></a>
This mistaken notion leads some people to favor IP because they figure
that if you own a scarce resource because you mix your labor with it,
you also own useful ideas that are produced with your labor. The related
Smith-Ricardo-Marx labor theory of value, which underlies Marxism and
socialism, is also sometimes used to support IP, as when people argue
that if you work or labor, you “deserve” some kind of reward or profit.
All this focus on labor must be rejected as overly metaphorical and
confused, and, frankly, Marxian.<a href="#fn886" class="footnote-ref"

<h5 id="e.-the-separate-roles-of-knowledge-and-means-in-action"><em>E.
The Separate Roles of Knowledge and Means in Action</em></h5>
<p>The purpose of property rights is to permit conflict-free use of
resources, the scarce means of action that humans employ to causally
interfere with the course of events in an attempt to achieve their ends.
But this applies only to <em>conflictable</em> resources. Human action
also implies the <em>possession of knowledge</em> by the actor—knowledge
of what ends are possible and knowledge of what scarce means might be
employed to <em>causally achieve</em> the desired end. Thus all
successful human action requires <em>two separate components</em>: the
availability of scarce means or resources and knowledge to guide one’s
action.<a href="#fn887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref887"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>887</sup></a> Property rights apply
<em>only</em> to the scarce means or conflictable resources that humans
employ, but not to the knowledge or information people possess, which
guides their behavior, since anyone can use the same or similar
knowledge to guide their own actions without conflict. In fact, it is
the accumulation of this technological knowledge over time that enables
increasing material prosperity. Property rights are needed to permit
conflict-free use of scarce resources, but imposing restrictions on the
emulation, learning, and use of knowledge, which is what IP attempts to
do, impoverishes the human race.<a href="#fn888" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref888" role="doc-noteref"><sup>888</sup></a> This is why I
concluded one article with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is obscene to undermine the glorious operation of the market in
producing wealth and abundance by imposing artificial scarcity on human
knowledge and learning…. Learning, emulation, and information are good.
It is good that information can be reproduced, retained, spread, and
taught and learned and communicated so easily. Granted, we cannot say
that it is <em>bad</em> that the world of physical resources is one of
scarcity—this is the way reality is, after all—but it is certainly a
challenge, and it makes life a struggle. It is suicidal and foolish to
try to hamper one of our most important tools—learning, emulation,
knowledge—by imposing scarcity on it. Intellectual property is theft.
Intellectual property is statism. Intellectual property is death. Give
us <em>intellectual freedom</em> instead!<a href="#fn889"

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref890"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>890</sup></a></h5>
<p>As noted above (see note 31), confusion about the IP issue sometimes
stems from identifying “property” with the owned resource. People then
get bogged down in loaded or confused questions like, “Are ideas
property?” If one keeps in mind that the question is not what is
property, but rather who is the owner of a conflictable resource, then
the IP mistake is harder to make. A related mistake stems from the
failure to understand that all human rights are property rights and all
property rights <em>just are</em> rights to the exclusive control of a
given scarce (conflictable) resource.<a href="#fn891"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref891" role="doc-noteref"><sup>891</sup></a>
But every property right is an ownership right held by a particular
person or owner with respect to a particular conflictable resource. It
is the actual resource itself which is owned, <em>not</em> its
characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, if you own a red car, you own that car, but you do not
own its color; you do not own red or redness. If owning a red car meant
you owned its characteristics, you would own not only that particular
car, but its age, weight, size, shape, color, and so on, and, thus,
would thereby have an ownership claim over any other object that is red,
and so on. This would amount to reassigning ownership rights in someone
else’s red car to you, even though he owns that car and you did not
homestead it or obtain it by contract. Likewise, information cannot be
owned since it is not an <em>independently existing thing</em>;
information is <em>always</em> the <em>impatterning</em> of an
underlying medium or carrier or substrate, which is itself a scarce
resource that has an owner.<a href="#fn892" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref892" role="doc-noteref"><sup>892</sup></a> If I own a copy of
<em>Great Expectations</em>, I own that physical object: paper and glue
and ink. It has various characteristics: an age, a size, a shape, and a
certain arrangement of ink on its pages—the way the ink is impatterned
so that it represents letters and words and meanings to someone who can
read and who can observe the features of the book. But just as you don’t
own the color of your car, you don’t own the way an object is arranged
or shaped.<a href="#fn893" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref893"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>893</sup></a></p>
<p>As Roderick Long explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may be objected that the person who originated the information
deserves ownership rights over it. But information is not a concrete
thing an individual can control; it is a <em>universal</em>, existing in
other people’s minds and other people’s property, and over these the
originator has no legitimate sovereignty. You cannot own information
without owning other people.<a href="#fn894" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref894" role="doc-noteref"><sup>894</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="g.-selling-does-not-imply-ownership895"><em>G. Selling Does Not
Imply Ownership</em><a href="#fn895" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref895"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>895</sup></a></h5>
<p>As noted in Part IV.B, above, it is literally impossible to own or
have property rights in information or knowledge. People only manipulate
and have conflict over scarce resources (they are means of action, after
all), so that IP rights are just disguised reassignments of property
rights in existing conflictable or scarce resources. And as noted in
Part IV.F, above, information cannot be owned since it is not an
<em>independently existing thing</em>; information is <em>always</em>
the <em>impatterning</em> of an underlying medium or carrier or
substrate, which is itself a scarce resource that already has an owner,
in accordance with principles of original appropriation, contract, and
rectification.</p>
<p>Yet IP proponents sometimes point out that information, ideas,
know-how, and so on (as well as labor), can be <em>sold</em>. And so,
the reasoning goes, something that can be <em>sold</em> must have been
<em>owned</em> by the seller. Therefore, information can, in fact, be
owned. As I have explained elsewhere, this reasoning is fallacious and
based on conflation of two senses of the word “sell.”<a href="#fn896"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref896" role="doc-noteref"><sup>896</sup></a>
When <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> exchange two owned objects, such as an
apple for an orange, then there are two title transfers. <em>A</em>
sells his apple to <em>B,</em> and <em>B</em> sells his orange to
<em>A</em>.</p>
<p>But other contracts only involve one title-transfer. Suppose
<em>B</em> pays <em>A</em> to perform some action (labor, a service,
providing information, etc.). In this case, <em>B</em>’s owned resource
(money or something else) transfers to <em>A,</em> but nothing that
<em>A</em> owns transfers to <em>B</em>. It is simply that <em>A</em>
performed some action that <em>B</em> desired, and was induced to do so
by <em>B</em>’s payment. In this case, the end of <em>B</em>’s act of
agreeing to pay <em>A</em> was not the attainment of a property right or
title transfer, but the achievement of a new state of affairs in which
<em>A</em> performed some action desired by <em>B</em>.<a href="#fn897"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref897" role="doc-noteref"><sup>897</sup></a>
<em>A</em> is sometimes said to “sell” his labor or information to
<em>B</em> because of the analogy to a normal exchange of title, but
here the word “sell” is used in the economic sense to simply explain
<em>A</em>’s motivations and to properly characterize his actions: to
understand his ends or goals. In order to get <em>B</em>’s payment,
<em>A</em> performed the action desired by <em>B</em>. <em>A</em> does
not “sell” his labor or knowledge in a juristic or legal sense, and thus
did not “own” it in a legal sense. Thus, “selling” in the economic sense
does not imply owning. Information is unownable.<a href="#fn898"

<h5 id="h.-all-property-rights-are-limited"><em>H. All Property Rights
Are Limited</em></h5>
<p>One final argument may be addressed, which is touched on in some of
the above sections.<a href="#fn899" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref899"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>899</sup></a> When explaining why IP rights
violate property rights, we IP opponents explain that the grant of an IP
right is tantamount to a nonconsensual negative easement on someone
else’s property—it limits what the owner of a resource may do with the
resource.<a href="#fn900" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref900"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>900</sup></a> Or, as Roderick Long would say,
“Owning Ideas Means Owning People.”<a href="#fn901" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref901" role="doc-noteref"><sup>901</sup></a></p>
<p>A common response runs something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, IP rights limit what you can do with your own property. But this
is true of all property rights. My ownership of a home, or my body,
means you can’t shoot your gun at it. So my property rights limit your
property rights. Therefore, just because intellectual property rights
limit your property rights doesn’t mean they are illegitimate any more
than my self-ownership limits your property rights in your gun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many problems with this argument, as I have detailed
elsewhere.<a href="#fn902" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref902"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>902</sup></a> First, even if we grant that in
some cases property rights can be limited, it does not imply that just
<em>any</em> limit is legitimate. If a woman objects to being raped, it
will not do to say “stop complaining that we are violating your property
right in your own body; after all, all property rights are limited.” You
would need to articulate why it’s justified to limit property rights. In
the examples given by IP proponents, someone’s property rights are
limited as needed to keep them from exercising those rights to commit
aggression against others’ property rights. But IP rights limit the
owner’s property rights (again, in the form of a negative servitude),
even though the owner, in rearranging <em>his own resources</em> in a
certain way, does not invade the borders of the inventor’s or author’s
property. In response to this, the IP proponent will say, “Yes, by
making a copy of the author/inventor’s creation, the copier is
infringing the author/inventor’s property rights.” But this is
question-begging. It presupposes that there <em>are</em> rights to
universals, when this is the issue under dispute.</p>
<p>Second, it is simply not true that property rights limit other
property rights. Rather, property rights limit <em>actions</em>. If
<em>A</em> owns his body, then <em>B</em> may not shoot it with a gun,
<em>whether he owns the gun or not</em>. The point is that <em>B</em>
may not use or invade the borders of <em>A</em>’s body—his owned
resource—with <em>any</em> means at all, whether it be the use of
<em>B</em>’s hands, or some other means such as a gun, even if he stole
the gun from <em>C</em> and is not its owner. People are responsible for
their <em>actions</em>, and actions always employ some means to achieve
the end. The means may be simply the actor’s own body, or it may be some
external object, one that may be owned by the actor, or not.<a
href="#fn903" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref903"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>903</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore, it <em>is</em> a valid criticism of IP that it unjustly
limits others’ use of their own resources.</p>
<h5
id="i.-the-structural-unity-of-real-and-intellectual-property"><em>I.
The Structural Unity of Real and Intellectual Property</em></h5>
<p>Another argument made in support of IP is that it is, legally,
structurally similar to normal property rights in scarce resources, such
as property rights in realty (land or immovables) or personalty
(corporeal movables).<a href="#fn904" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref904"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>904</sup></a> This is an odd argument. It is
true that the state, via legislation, is able to set up positive rights
that, in modern legal systems, are treated similarly to property rights
in scarce resources (land and personalty). But so what? In antebellum
America, under chattel slavery, slaves—innocent human beings—were
legally ownable and thus subject to the various legal incidents of
property, such as sale, mortgages, and so on. The fact that the state,
by artificial legislation, can make inventions and artistic creations
the subject of contracts, sales, and so on does not show that the law is
just. This is just a facile argument.<a href="#fn905"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref905"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>905</sup></a></p>
<p>First, patent and copyright were not originally called property
rights. They were referred to accurately as state-granted privileges or
monopolies.<a href="#fn906" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref906"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>906</sup></a> Referring to patent and copyright
as “property rights” was a later innovation, engaged in for propaganda
purposes. This was observed by Fritz Machlup and Edith Penrose in a
seminal study in 1950:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many writers who habitually call all sorts of rights by the
name of property. This may be a harmless waste of words, or it may have
a purpose. It happens that <em>those who started using the word property
in connection with inventions had a very definite purpose in mind: they
wanted to substitute a word with a respectable connotation, “property,”
for a word that had an unpleasant ring, “privilege.”</em><a
href="#fn907" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref907"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>907</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as Machlup wrote in a later study commissioned by the US
Congress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While some economists before 1873 were anxious to deny that patents
conferred “monopolies”—and, indeed, had talked of “property in
inventions” chiefly in order to avoid using the unpopular word
“monopoly”—most of this squeamishness has disappeared. But most writers
want to make it understood that these are not “odious” monopolies but
rather “social monopolies”, “general welfare monopolies”, or “socially
earned” monopolies. Most writers also point out with great emphasis that
the monopoly grant is limited and conditional.<a href="#fn908"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref908"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>908</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Michael Davis also explores the strategy of those who
insist on erroneously classifying patents as property rights. He calls
this tactic “the trump of property,” which is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a strategy of defining patents according to property law concepts far
removed from debates over the public interest in the issuance of patents
…. [T]he foregoing description of patent law as a form of competition
regulation, let alone as a form of national industrial policy, is
obviously not the conventional one. Organized patent interests (the
patent bar, patent proprietors, and their sponsors) do not espouse that
view, but instead habitually offer a more cramped description of patent
law. One might call that description the trump of property—a strategy to
secure the claim that proprietors can exclusively own patents, and to
eliminate any argument that the public has a continuing interest in
issued patents. That description promotes patents as just another kind
of property, but firmly rejects any suggestion that patent law
represents either a form of competition regulation or a national
industrial policy. With a firm foundation in free market theories, the
strong claim that patents are just another form of property implicitly
rejects the idea that patent law serves any regulatory function….<a
href="#fn909" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref909"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>909</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davis also notes, of the attempt by defenders of patents to deny that
they are monopolies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This “debate” seemingly has only one point: to sanitize the patent
monopoly so that it more closely resembles simple property. A monopoly,
of course, virtually compels the public interest. Thus, the trump of
property depends on asserting not only that a patent is simple property,
but also that it does not constitute an economic phenomenon, like a
monopoly, in which the public has a particular interest.<a href="#fn910"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref910"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>910</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that, despite the assertions of defenders of IP, these
rights are <em>not</em> like normal property rights in scarce resources.
First, unlike property rights in scarce resources like personalty
(movables) and real estate or land (immovables), IP rights in inventions
(patents) and creative works (copyright) expire after a finite
term—about 17 or so years for patents, and life of the author plus 70
years for copyright (say, about 120 years for a 40 year old author who
lives to age 90). Second, the “borders” or boundaries defined by
copyright law in “works” and by patent law for “inventions” is
inherently murky, vague, arbitrary, and non-objective.</p>
<p>Scholars have noted other differences between IP and normal property
rights. Writes Professor Tom Bell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copyrights and patents differ from tangible property in fundamental
ways. Economically speaking, copyrights and patents are not rivalrous in
consumption; whereas all the world can sing the same beautiful song, for
instance, only one person can swallow a cool gulp of iced tea. Legally
speaking, copyrights and patents exist only thanks to the express terms
of the U.S. Constitution and various statutory enactments. In contrast,
we enjoy tangible property thanks to common law, customary practices,
and nature itself. Even birds recognize property rights in nests. They
do not, however, copyright their songs.</p>
<p>Those represent but some of the reasons I have argued that we should
call copyright an <em>intellectual privilege</em>, reserving
<em>property</em> for things that deserve the label. Another, related
reason: Calling copyright <em>property</em> risks eroding that valuable
service mark.<a href="#fn911" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref911"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>911</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding Epstein’s contentions about the “structural unity” between
IP and real property rights, Professor Peter Menell concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he Property Rights Movement is too limited and grounded in
absolutist ideology to support the needs of a dynamic,
resource-sensitive intellectual property system. Professor Epstein’s
simplistic equation of real and intellectual property generates more
heat than light. It is not particularly helpful to think of real and
intellectual property as structurally unified. The differences matter
significantly and resorting to rhetorical metaphors distracts attention
from critical issues. As Judge (later Justice) Cardozo cautioned in
1926, “[m]etaphors in law are to be narrowly watched, for starting as
devices to liberate thought, they end often by enslaving it.”<a
href="#fn912" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref912"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>912</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are even further dissimilarities between IP rights and normal
property rights. For example, as Professors Dorfman and Jacob write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In these pages we seek to integrate two claims. First, we argue that,
taken to their logical conclusions, the considerations that support a
strict form of protection for tangible property rights do not call for a
similar form of protection when applied to the case of copyright. More
dramatically, these considerations <em>demand</em>, on pain of glaring
inconsistency, a substantially weaker protection for copyright. In
pursuing this claim, we show that the form of protecting property rights
(including rights in tangibles) is, to an important extent, a feature of
certain normal, though contingent, facts about the human world. Second,
the normative question concerning the selection of a desirable
protection for creative works is most naturally pursued from a tort law
perspective, in part because the normative structure of copyright law
simply is that of tort law.<a href="#fn913" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref913" role="doc-noteref"><sup>913</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, as Wendy Gordon writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “property” portion of the “intellectual property” label has
caused practical as well as conceptual difficulties. Too many courts
have assumed that all things called “property” should be treated
similarly, ignoring the important physical, institutional, and statutory
differences that distinguish intellectual “property” from the tangible
kind.<a href="#fn914" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref914"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>914</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I should note that, to my knowledge, none of the
above-quoted scholars is an IP or patent abolitionist, except perhaps
for Davis re patents. But they are honest scholars who recognize IP as
being an unnatural legal regime distinct from natural, common law
property rights.</p>
<p>In sum, IP rights, especially patent and copyright, are not like
property rights in scarce resources. And even if they were, this would
not make them just, any more than the ability to make human slaves
property justifies that institution.</p>
<h5 id="j.-john-locke-and-the-founders-on-ip-as-a-natural-right"><em>J.
John Locke and the Founders on IP as a Natural Right</em></h5>
<p>In what seems to be nothing more than an appeal to authority, some
defenders of IP argue that IP rights are not artificial state-granted
monopoly privileges, but rather natural property rights, and that this
was recognized by Locke and the Founders of the US Constitution and
various constitutional interpretations of patent and copyright.<a
href="#fn915" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref915"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>915</sup></a></p>
<p>First, it must be said that it is irrelevant whether Locke and some
Founding Fathers thought of IP as a natural right or not. If they did,
they were just wrong.</p>
<p>It is clear that Jefferson did not.<a href="#fn916"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref916" role="doc-noteref"><sup>916</sup></a>
He was not opposed to patent and copyright, but clearly viewed them as
grants of monopoly privilege, a policy tool. After all, during the
drafting of the Bill of Rights, Jefferson, in a Letter to James Madison,
proposed an amendment to the draft Bill of Rights to limit the terms of
“monopolies” (patent and copyright) to a fixed number of years,
to-wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art. 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own
productions in literature and their own inventions in the arts for a
term not exceeding — years but for no longer term and no other
purpose.<a href="#fn917" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref917"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>917</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another letter, to Isaac McPherson, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was,
until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general
law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other
countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and
personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that
these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society;
and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of
invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.<a
href="#fn918" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref918"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>918</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for Locke, he did favor copyright for authors, but only as a
policy tool. He did not view IP rights as natural property rights. As
Professor Tom Bell explains, Locke’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… labor-desert justification of property gives authors clear title to
the particular tangible copy in which they fix their expression. If an
author has already acquired property rights in paper and ink by dint of
creating them or, more likely, consensual exchange, and then mixes those
two forms of chattel property, tracing ink words on cellulose paper,
then the author enjoys natural and common-law rights in the newly
arranged physical property. But it remains a separate—and
contestable—question whether that argument establishing rights in
<em>atoms</em> also justifies giving an author property rights to a
parcel in the imaginary realm of ideas. Locke himself did not try to
justify intangible property. He appears, in fact, to have viewed
copyright as merely a policy tool for promoting the public good. Modern
commentators who would venture so far beyond the boundaries of Locke’s
thought, into the abstractions of intellectual property, thus go further
than Locke ever dared and further than they should in his name….</p>
<p>Unlike Epstein, I find that natural property rights theory can help
fully explain a broad range of human behavior and offers a useful tool
for assessing the justifiability of social institutions. Like him,
however, I doubt that Locke’s theory can justify copyright. To Epstein’s
trenchant critiques, I add one targeted at any supposed natural property
right in expressive works: copyright contradicts Locke’s own
justification of property. Locke described legislation authorizing the
Stationers’ Company monopoly on printing—the nearest thing to a
Copyright Act in his day—as a “manifest … invasion of the trade,
liberty, and property of the subject.” Today, by invoking government
power a copyright holdercan impose prior restraint, fines, imprisonment,
and confiscation on those engaged in peaceful expression and the quiet
enjoyment of tangible property. Copyright law violates the very
rights—the tangible property rights—that Locke set out to defend. …</p>
<p>As our careful review of the historical record has showed … the
Founders probably did not regard copyright as a natural right.<a
href="#fn919" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref919"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>919</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In support of his contentions here, Bell cites Ronan Deazley, who
“reads Locke’s correspondence to indicate that ‘Locke himself did not
consider [that] his theory of property extended to intellectual
properties such as copyrights and patents,’ and instead recognized that
it could exist only [by] grace of parliamentary action.”<a href="#fn920"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref920"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>920</sup></a></p>
<p>In sum, IP rights, especially patent and copyright, have always been
viewed as mere policy tools, not as natural property rights. These laws
cannot be justified by appeals to authority.</p>

<p>Libertarian sci-fi author J. Neil Schulman, an old friend, and I
agreed on most political matters, except for intellectual property (IP),
over which we’ve had a decades-long disagreement.<sup>*</sup> Neil
modified his theory over time, moving from “logorights” to
“media-carried property,” and eventually published <em>Origitent: Why
Original Content is Property</em> in 2018, which included debates and

and included my Introduction.<sup>†</sup> I have updated my

Property.”</p>
<h4 id="introduction">“INTRODUCTION”</h4>
<p>“Hey, Kinsella, why would you write an introduction for a
pro-intellectual property book?” my friends might ask me. I mean, did
ask me.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-this">WHY DO THIS?</h4>
<p>I could think of a few possible responses. First—I might say—it’s not
an introduction. It’s really a foreword. Hence my scare quotes.<a
href="#fn922" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref922"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>922</sup></a> But the publisher insisted on
calling my contribution an introduction. Much to my aplomb. Or chagrin.
Whatever the word is. But let’s face it, this is a weaselly response.
What does it matter whether it’s a foreword or introduction?</p>
<p>Second, Neil objects to the term “intellectual property” to describe
his views, as you’ll find in the pages that follow. He argues for
property rights in what he used to call logorights but now refers to as
“media carried property” (MCP). He tends to say that he opposes modern
IP law—patent and copyright. But though he says he’s not for IP law, he
has sometimes gotten upset at my suggestion that patent and copyright
law should be abolished. Hey, Neil, if you’re not in favor of IP law
then why do you bristle at my call to abolish it? Confuses the hell out
of me. I think he does that just to keep me off balance. But it’s cool,
it’s cool, I do the same to him.</p>
<p>Third, this is my chance to “come out”—to announce that I have
finally changed my mind about IP and am now an ardent supporter of a
certain form of legal protection for products of the mind. Because of
the power and clarity of Neil’s revised arguments, I’ve finally seen the
light! As many know, as a newly-minted libertarian, I was initially in
favor of IP (Ayn Rand ensnares a lot of us newbies), before developing
some doubts about the notion. As a young patent attorney,<br />
I diverted my libertarian efforts towards finding and developing a good
argument for IP. I pored through the literature, reading and studying
tons of articles and books by legal scholars, political philosophers,
economists, and libertarians of various stripes, searching for a way to
justify patent and copyright. Hey, I did the work, so you don’t have to.
Anyway. I finally gave up and became an atheist. Sorry, I mean an
opponent of IP. Despite my upbringing. I mean career. I became an
anti-IP IP attorney. I became a self-hating patent lawyer. (But a
<em>damn good</em> one.)</p>
<p>But keep in mind that I was always looking for proof of God. Sorry—I
mean a good argument for IP. I <em>wanted</em> to find a justification
for patent law, after all—it was my career. Just like I wanted to find
an argument for God after being a lifelong Catholic and altar boy. But I
failed in my quest (both of them, not that they are connected, exactly).
I was unable to square the circle. So I finally became the IP version of
atheist, because I just couldn’t find a good argument for IP.</p>
<p>But Neil never gave up. His original “logorights” argument (first
published in 1983) didn’t persuade me. But then, after repeated sparring
with me, he reformulated his argument. He adjusted it. He tweaked it.
Now, it’s about “media carried property.” And <em>mirabile dictu!</em>,
he has done it! He has finally found a solid footing for a type of IP,
one that has persuaded even me, Kinsella, arch-enemy of IP! Finally, my
whole career is actually justified! All I need do is recant my IP heresy
here, in this <em>soi-disant</em> “Introduction.”</p>
<h4 id="coming-clean"><em>Coming Clean</em></h4>
<p>Okay, time to come clean. I can’t keep up pretenses anymore. As the
punchline to the joke goes, “I’m just f*cking with you—she’s dead.”<a
href="#fn923" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref923"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>923</sup></a> In other words—I was joking. I’m
not “coming out.” I’m still anti-IP. So everybody just relax. I still
think Neil is wrong. And he thinks I’m wrong. And we’re cool with that.
That’s how libertarian bros do.</p>
<p>One thing you can say: Neil’s given this issue repeated valiant
efforts. Maybe it just takes him longer than me to give up. I gave it up
after a good ten-plus years of diligent study and effort. Neil’s been
steadfast in his support for his version of IP for maybe 35 years now.
That takes a special kind of stupid. I mean dedication.</p>
<p>So scratch the third reason. And let’s face it, my first two “points”
were really not very good arguments at all.</p>
<p>So back to the first question: why would I write this introduction?
What’s my purpose? What’s the purpose of this book? Okay. Let me try
this angle. The historical angle. The setting. The context.</p>
<h4 id="the-historical-setting-of-intellectual-property">THE HISTORICAL
SETTING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>
<p>Look. Here’s what happened. IP existed in scattered/proto forms
hundreds of years ago, in the form of monopoly grants of privilege by
the state. It goes back a long way, probably as far back as nascent
forms of protectionism and proto-state-granted monopoly privilege. We
see traces of it as far back as 2,500 years ago: in about 500 B.C., in
the Greek city of Sybaris, located in what is now southern Italy, there
were annual culinary competitions. The victor was given the exclusive
right to prepare his dish for one year.<a href="#fn924"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref924" role="doc-noteref"><sup>924</sup></a>
Sort of like a copyright. Or patent. Some kind of right to his
origitent. And then, over the ensuing centuries, there were variousforms
of protectionism, and also attempts to promote or protect or
“incentivize” innovation and creativity. These controls were intermixed
with mercantilism (protectionism) and censorship.<a href="#fn925"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref925"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>925</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="patents"><em>Patents</em></h4>
<p>Let’s consider the origins of patents, property rights in
inventions—techniques or machine designs that accomplish some practical
purpose. A mousetrap, a method for threshing corn. But the original
grant of patents did not usually involve some innovative machine or
process. In England, the king would hand out monopoly privilege rights
to cronies, maybe in exchange for helping the king out, by helping to
collect taxes, and so on. These grants were called “letters
patent”—patent meaning “open.” “Only John Smythe may sell playing cards
in ye olde town of Bluxsome-on-Thames” or whatever (and then government
goons would raid his competitors on occasion to ensure they were not
selling counterfeit or “pirated” cards… a bit ironic given that one of
the early uses of Letters Patent by the British Crown was to entice
pirates to become “privateers” [a fancy name for legitimized piracy], by
giving them a monopoly over some of the spoils of their piracy for a
given time).<a href="#fn926" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref926"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>926</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="real-pirates"><em>Real Pirates</em></h4>
<p>A notorious example is Francis Drake, who was given a Letter Patent
on March 15, 1587, to authorize his piracy, such as attacking Spanish
ships sailing back from South America laden with silver, handing it over
to the Queen after taking his share. Sir Francis Drake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… made the first English slaving voyages, taking Africans to the New
World. Drake attacked Spanish ships sailing back from South America
laden with silver. He took their treasure for himself and his queen. He
also raided Spanish and Portuguese ports. He undertook a
circumnavigation of the world in 1572 and 1573. He discovered that
Tierra del Fuego was not part of the Southern Continent and explored the
west coast of South America. He plundered ports in Chile and Peru and
captured treasure ships. He sailed up to California and then across the
Pacific Ocean to the East Indies. He returned to England with his ship
full of spices and treasure, so gaining great acclaim.”<a href="#fn927"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref927"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>927</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, patents were originally used to <em>authorize</em>
actual piracy, in addition to protecting favored court cronies from
competition and thus restricting the free market. So it is a bit ironic
that modern defenders of IP claim to be opposed to IP “pirates”—even
though <em>real</em> pirates (like Francis Drake) kill people, break
things, and take things from people (and deliver slaves into bondage),
while “information pirates” do none of these things.</p>
<h4 id="the-statute-of-monopolies-of-1623"><em>The Statute of Monopolies
of 1623</em></h4>
<p>In any case, “Letters Patent” began to be used widely by monarchs to
grant monopoly privileges to favored cronies on a certain trade or
industryor product in a certain region. When this protectionism and
restraint on free trade became too noticeably abusive, Parliament
stepped in and passed the Statute of Monopolies of 1623 (notice the
name: “monopolies”; they were at least honest back then), which
restricted the King’s power to issue letters patent, since they were
basically trade restrictions, protectionism, privileges,
<em>monopolies</em>. But the statute made an exception: monopoly
privileges could still be granted for genuine “inventions”—i.e., for
technical innovations.</p>
<h4 id="copyright"><em>Copyright</em></h4>
<p>As for copyright—until the printing press, the Church and Crown held
a nice monopoly over controlling published thought, by means of scribes
and guilds like the Stationer’s Company, which held a monopoly over
publishing from about 1557 until the Statute of Anne of 1710. During
this time the printing press emerged and disrupted the state and
church’s control over printed works, leading to the Statue of Anne 1710,
which recognized authors’ copyrights in their works. But because, as a
practical matter, authors still had to appeal to regulated presses to
publish their works, the state and church were able to maintain their
censorial control over what could be published, and the modern
publishing system arose where publishing houses served as gatekeepers
and the middlemen between authors and consumers.<a href="#fn928"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref928"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>928</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="ip-in-the-industrial-age">IP IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGE</h4>
<p>Fast-forward to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. The United
States of America managed to break free from England in 1776 and
established its own Constitution in 1789, which drew, of course, upon
English legal principles and practices. And so Article 1, Section 8,
Clause 8 of the US Constitution authorizes Congress “to promote the
progress of science and the useful arts by securing for a limited time
to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective
writings and discoveries.” Basically, this is the authorization for
modern patent and copyright law. And thus emerged the modern system of
patent and copyright that dominate the world today. Modern patent law,
anchored in protectionist grants of monopoly privilege; and copyright
law, rooted in censorship, gatekeepers, and control of thought and
freedom of the press.</p>
<p>And of course world GDP, flat for thousands of years, began to
exponentially increase right around this time.<a href="#fn929"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref929" role="doc-noteref"><sup>929</sup></a>
Those who mistake correlation with causation argue that the wealth and
might and prosperity of the West are linked to our adoption of
European/English-style patent and copyright law, though studies backing
up these claims are wanting.<a href="#fn930" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref930" role="doc-noteref"><sup>930</sup></a></p>
<p>And so the narrative was put in motion. The previous gatekeeper
publishing industries seized on the new copyright system and quickly
internationalized it apace with the progress of the Industrial
Revolution (google “Berne Convention”). And new industries, captured by
the monopoly profits possible by using institutionalized patents granted
by an inept state bureaucracy, became entrenched and started defending
patents.</p>
<p>And then the free market economists emerged in the 1800s and started
to become alarmed at the proliferation of widespread, institutionalized
grants of IP—which was obviously a restraint on trade, protectionism,
censorship, and infringement of free market property rights. They
basically emerged from their slumbers and said, “What the hell? You
people have got to stop this.” And they correctly referred to these
state-initiated practices as “grants of monopoly privilege.”<a
href="#fn931" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref931"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>931</sup></a> In response, the publishers, the
gatekeepers, and industries now increasingly reliant on patent and
copyright, intentionally, and deceitfully, bent the language of “natural
property rights” to serve their purpose. Patent and copyright became
“intellectual property rights” instead of monopoly privilege grants.<a
href="#fn932" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref932"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>932</sup></a> Much like health care is thought
of as a “right” today.<a href="#fn933" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref933" role="doc-noteref"><sup>933</sup></a> And thus the
ideological battle for IP was won by means of cheap semantics. Plus
pressure groups (big Pharma, Hollywood, music, software), and some
confusion spawned by Locke himself about the labor theory of property.<a
href="#fn934" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref934"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>934</sup></a></p>
<p>Nowadays virtually everyone assumes that the innovation that
accompanied the spectacular prosperity in the modern West was due, at
least in part, to patent and copyright law. And that if you are in favor
of innovation or artistic creativity, you must be in favor of property
rights for “products of the mind,” or “the fruits of one’s labor,” or
other metaphors that serve only to distort and deceive and lie and
confuse thought.</p>
<h4 id="historical-and-modern-arguments-about-ip">HISTORICAL AND MODERN
ARGUMENTS ABOUT IP</h4>
<p>We can say that institutionalized IP rights began at the dawn of the
Industrial Revolution, for example in the American and then European
patent and copyright systems, which traced back to European institutions
and practices such as the Statute of Monopolies of 1623 and the Statute
of Anne of 1710. As these modern, institutionalized IP systems began to
take hold in the 1800s, this provoked, first, a backlash from free
market economists and then a defensive response from the entrenched IP
interests. By the 1870s, the IP side had won.<a href="#fn935"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref935"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>935</sup></a></p>
<p>Among proto-libertarians, and especially some anarchists, the chief
figures debating IP, in the late 1800s, were Lysander Spooner and
Benjamin Tucker. Spooner proposed a radically pro-IP theory, rooted in
the Lockean labor theory of property, while Tucker opposed IP, on
grounds similar to his arguments against other forms of monopoly.<a
href="#fn936" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref936"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>936</sup></a></p>
<p>Amongst libertarians and proto-libertarians, the issue lay
mostlydormant until the mid-1980s, when thinkers such as Sam Konkin,
Wendy McElroy, and J. Neil Schulman entered the fray again. Konkin and
especially McElroy provided the first systematic arguments against IP
rooted in modern libertarian property rights principles, while Schulman
was one of the first to attempt to provide a principled (as opposed to
utilitarian or empirical) argument for a type of IP also rooted in
libertarian propertarian principles.<a href="#fn937"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref937"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>937</sup></a></p>
<p>With the dawning digital age and the Internet of the mid-late 1990s
making copying and “piracy” far easier than ever before, copyright and
related IP issues began to attract more attention from libertarians.
Libertarians have long recognized that the main issues that confront us
are war, taxation, state education, the drug war, and central banking.
Many of us now believe that IP lies in the baleful company of these
other horrible institutions and, in a sense, is worst of all: because
war, taxation, etc., are seen, at least by some libertarians, as
<em>necessary evils</em>; but patent and copyright are labeled
“intellectual property” and thus fly under the banner of “property
rights,” which are supposed to be good things, by libertarian lights.
Thus, IP is far more insidious because, while you might want to minimize
war and taxation as much as possible even if you think they are
necessary evils—they are evils, after all—all good libertarians support
robust legal support for strong property rights. And if IP is a
legitimate property right, it’s not a necessary evil at all; it’s a good
thing.</p>
<p>With patent law threatening, impeding, and distorting innovation and
technological growth and human prosperity, and with copyright distorting
culture, censoring thought and speech and freedom of the press and
indeed threatening Internet freedom, it is no wonder that IP has become
an issue of interest and overwhelming importance amongst libertarians.<a
href="#fn938" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref938"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>938</sup></a></p>
<p>This is why it is crucial for libertarians to understand modern IP
and its relationship to property rights. To think about whether and how
anything like patent or copyright can be justified. This issue is
crucial. Innovation and creativity are essential for human survival, and
so are property rights. And the state and its laws are dangerous. So
it’s important that we get this right: whether there should be any form
of intellectual property rights, or not, and, if so, what and why.
Unprincipled, utilitarian, empirical thinking will not help us figure
this out. You can’t just say that a 120 year copyright term is “too
much” but we “need something greater than zero.”<a href="#fn939"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref939" role="doc-noteref"><sup>939</sup></a>
You need a principled approach. And though I disagree with Neil’s
conclusions, I respect the fact that he has for over three decades
fought to figure out these issues with libertarian property rights
principles in mind.</p>
<p>One final note. One argument we IP abolitionists use is that
copyright is a form of censorship, and we oppose censorship. We applaud
the communication and publication of ideas, arguments. Those of us
interested in libertarian ideas about justice and property rights, and
innovation and creativity, should applaud Neil for providing to the
public, in accessible form, his sincere and interesting thoughts about
these matters.</p>

17: Conversation with Schulman about Logorights and Media-Carried
Property</h3>
<p>This edited transcript of a conversation between libertarian sci-fi
author J. Neil Schulman and me was in his book <em>Origitent: Why
Original Content is Property</em> (2018).<sup>*</sup> My introduction to
<em>Origitent</em> is included as chapter 16 in this volume.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup> J. Neil Schulman, <em>Origitent: Why Original Content is
Property</em> (Steve Heller Publishing, 2018;
https://perma.cc/2E6G-WWPE). This chapter of his book was based on
Kinsella, “KOL208 | Conversation with Schulman about Logorights and
Media-Carried Property,” <em>Kinsella on Liberty Podcast</em> (March 4,
2016), which was transcribed by Rosemary Denshaw and edited for clarity
for use in Schulman’s book. I have further improved the transcript and
added some references and comments in footnotes.</p>
<p><strong>Stephan Kinsella</strong>: Hey, this is Stephan Kinsella
doing an episode of the <em>Kinsella on Liberty</em> podcast. This
should be number 208. I’ve got my old friend, Neil Schulman, online.
We’ve actually met in person, haven’t we Neil?</p>
<p><strong>J. Neil Schulman</strong>: Yeah. As I recall, it was at
Libertopia a few years ago.<a href="#fn940" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref940" role="doc-noteref"><sup>940</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Kinsella</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Schulman</strong>: I’m doing well. How about you?</p>
<p>Kinsella: It’s all right. Today is March 4<sup>th</sup>, 2016. You
and I have known each other for maybe, what, 30+ years now?</p>
<p>Schulman: It’s been a while. And I must say a lot friendlier now than
we used to be.<a href="#fn941" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref941"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>941</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, in the beginning it was friendly. Remember on the
GEnie Forums in the old days before the internet?</p>
<p>Schulman: My God, I didn’t remember that we met on GEnie. That goes
back to the early 90s.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, that’s where I sent you the review of your
<em>Heinleiniana</em> book.<a href="#fn942" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref942" role="doc-noteref"><sup>942</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: Oh yes, yes. And it’s one of the many interests we have in
common.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, Heinlein. Of course, you knew him better than I
did.<a href="#fn943" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref943"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>943</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: Well, I was very lucky to be able to interview him for the
<em>The New York Daily News,</em> which led to our meeting and
subsequent friendship.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. Right. Well, I think we’re friendly when we’re not
threatening to convert each other to IP socialism. It depends on our
definitions.</p>
<p>Schulman: Ha ha. Actually, it’s amazing how much we agree on. And
there’s just one bone of contention which has occupied 90% of our
energy.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah and probably it’s only because, as I have dug into
this IP issue over the years, I get more and more into meticulous
details because I keep seeing what I think are the errors that cause
some mistakes to keep being perpetrated. So I get more and more into
minutiae, but anyway. Do you remember a few years ago, I think I dug up
the old information and got the tapes from someone, from that IP debate
you had done with Wendy McElroy back in like ’83 I think, right?</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes. And that was my first entry into this controversy.</p>
<p>Kinsella: And I think Wendy’s was ’81 with some newsletters in
California and then ’83. So I really think the modern debate on this
started around then, to be honest.<a href="#fn944" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref944" role="doc-noteref"><sup>944</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: Well, actually for me, it went back even further in time,
because I was part of the close circle of Samuel Edward Konkin, III and
his magazines: <em>New Libertarian Notes,</em> <em>New Libertarian
Weekly, New Libertarian</em> and various other publications. And of
course I was also good friends with Robert LeFevre. Both Sam and Bob
LeFevre were opposed to the idea of state copyright and state patents.<a
href="#fn945" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref945"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>945</sup></a> And where I was coming in was a
very early attempt to justify not statist concepts—being an anarchist,
an agorist, I’m opposed to that—but to see if there was a natural law
and natural right basis for a concept of ownership of content which
existed only as what today I now call media-carried property,<a
href="#fn946" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref946"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>946</sup></a> but back then I called
logorights.</p>
<p>The idea being that something didn’t have to be made out of atoms and
molecules in order to satisfy the requirements for a copyright claim.
Now Sam allowed copyrights for individual writers in his publications.
So he was not <em>so</em> opposed to it that he said, no, it has to be
without copyright. And at that time, I don’t even think there were
Creative Commons licenses to enter the discussion.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well …<a href="#fn947" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref947"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>947</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: And Bob LeFevre, while he was opposed to copyright, he
actually endorsed my concepts of logorights as worth considering,
beginning right after my debate with Wendy McElroy.<a href="#fn948"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref948" role="doc-noteref"><sup>948</sup></a>
I would say that if I were to boil it down to my position today, is that
I am not so much discussing the question of intellectual property, or
ideas as property, two concepts which I reject out of hand, but that I
am exploring that property <em>itself</em> is an intellectual artifact.
And as I posted on your Facebook wall today, I think that it comes
closest to being an intellectual artifact of contract law.<a
href="#fn949" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref949"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>949</sup></a> Whether or not, as you posted,
contract law is a subset of property law or whether property law is a
subset of contract law is a debate I don’t think is really worth
spending a lot of time on. But I do think that property itself is an
intellectual concept which falls under both a discussion of legal rights
and a discussion of natural law and natural rights as libertarians would
understand it.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well before we get into your theories, let’s talk a little
bit more about the background because I think we have another thing in
common. Maybe you would agree or not on this, but my suspicion is you
had—I know you had sort of a Randian approach to some issues in your
libertarianism, and you also were, and are, a writer and a successful
career writer, right, a novelist. So you had an interest in trying to
find a way to justify something that you had like a financial interest
in, right?</p>
<p>And I did, too, in a way, because I was a patent attorney, and I
still am. That’s one reason I started searching as well. And the reason
I was searching was because Ayn Rand influenced me early on. And one of
the arguments she made that never did persuade me was her argument for
IP. Something about it was just not like her other arguments. It was
sort of arbitrary and utilitarian. It just didn’t make sense like her
other arguments did. But I was going to do patent law and copyright law
for my career, and I’m a libertarian. So I started thinking, let me find
a better solution for this. So I was searching as well. It’s just you
came up with logorights and I came up with skepticism.</p>
<p>Schulman: It’s ironic that you, as a patent lawyer, are probably one
of the leading scholars today opposed to the very field you are
operating in, which is patent law. But, in my case, I think you have the
cause and effect reversed. My being a writer was not the reason why I
felt it worth pursuing. It was my interest primarily as a libertarian
natural law/natural rights believer which led me to this. And, in fact,
I would say that I was probably more influenced by Robert LeFevre’s
approach to property rights <em>per se</em> than I was to Ayn
Rand’s.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay, I accept that. But you would admit there is, there
tends to be some correlation. I tend to find …</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, let me let you off the hook by saying that in my
original article, “Informational Property: Logorights,”<a href="#fn950"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref950" role="doc-noteref"><sup>950</sup></a>
I did quote from Ayn Rand because I found that parts of her argument
were expressive, but in terms of the basic theory of property which I
was pursuing, I thought that Robert LeFevre made a more comprehensive
case.</p>
<p>Kinsella: No, but what I was going to say it seems to be no
coincidence that there’s a disproportionate number of libertarian
novelists who <em>happen to</em> support copyright, just like almost all
patent lawyers <em>happen to</em> support patent and copyright. Do you
follow me? I don’t think it’s quite a coincidence.</p>
<p>Schulman: But you see, it seems to me that that’s starting off with,
if I may use a term that Ludwig von Mises liked a lot, paralogia. In
other words, it transfers the argument from a debate of the merits to a
debate on the motivation of the people who are arguing it.<a
href="#fn951" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref951"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>951</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, I don’t mean to argue substance <em>by</em>
psychologizing, but I do find psychologizing fun sometimes. I can’t deny
it. And I do think that at least, at the very least, we should be aware
of our biases and try to be sure that if you’re advocating something
that happens to be in your favor, that you have good reasons for it
anyway. But, of course, the arguments stand on their own merits, I
think.</p>
<p>But, by the converse, I get attacked quite often for <em>being</em>
an IP lawyer and for opposing it,<a href="#fn952" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref952" role="doc-noteref"><sup>952</sup></a> as if, if my
arguments, if they were correct, it’s as if you wouldn’t expect an IP
lawyer to be one of the people that would recognize that. I mean it’s
possible to actually know something about the field that is unjustified
and corrupt and to come to those conclusions, even though it’s not in
your personal, immediate interest.</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, look, just switching to somewhere else just as a for
instance, because what I’m noting is not what I call hypocrisy but
merely irony, okay? Wouldn’t you find it at least ironic if you had a
medical doctor, an obstetrician, say, who said that he was opposed to
abortion who then, as part of his practice, performed abortions.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yes. In fact, I think that might be hypocritical. It could
be. But, first of all, I don’t think there is anything wrong with
pointing out irony any more than psychologizing, it’s kind of
interesting—and it may be ironic. I don’t think it happens to be ironic.
Let’s suppose that there is a healthy difference of agreement among the
population as a whole or among academics or scholars about IP; 30/70,
whatever. I don’t know. I mean it would be ironic if <em>some</em>
percentage of patent lawyers didn’t take that side, if everyone
<em>automatically</em> agreed with it. As for the hypocrisy or the irony
issue, it would be more ironic if I were out there <em>suing</em> people
in the name of IP. So I agree that would be more difficult. But if you
understand the way …</p>
<p>Schulman: Then let me establish this. I have never filed a lawsuit on
behalf of any of my literary rights.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. No, I understand that … most copyright holders don’t
have those scruples. You have your anarchist and your voluntaryist
scruples. So that tamps down the excesses that you might otherwise go
to. So I understand that.</p>
<p>Schulman: Okay and now let me also make clear that in practice, when
I have opposed pirating of my rights, I’ve only done so vocally in
instances where I felt that it was damaging to a third party.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. Like more of a fraud type argument or something like
that?</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, not even fraud. But let me give you an example. There
was supposedly, I’m not sure, and I’m being told now that this never
happened, but there was a representation that there was going to be a
pirate screening of the <em>Alongside Night</em> movie at PorcFest to
compete with the official screening that I went to a lot of trouble to
sell at a movie theater …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. I heard about that.</p>
<p>Schulman: … nearby Roger’s Campground. Okay? And I was upset about it
because the whole purpose of the screening was set up as a fundraiser
for the Free State Project. And so, I felt that a pirate screening
competing with a fundraiser for the Free State Project was damaging to
the Free State Project, and that upset me.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I understand that. Of course, that has nothing to do with
the validity of copyright or even logorights, but I understand.</p>
<p>Schulman: Right. And, again, all of this is sort of like, as I say,
paralogia. It’s an interesting background discussion, but really it
doesn’t speak to the actual question of whether under a general theory
of property rights which I maintain is a moral and a legal
construct—it’s a subset of a theory of natural law leading to natural
human rights—that I consider property rights to be primarily an
ontological and moral issue. And then you get to it as a legal
issue.</p>
<p>But let me start by conceding to you that, as I observe it right now,
the mainstream position of the libertarian movement, as I perceive it,
is anti what they perceive as artistic rights in things which are not
physical objects.<a href="#fn953" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref953"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>953</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay.</p>
<p>Schulman: So, in essence, I’m fighting an uphill battle, a battle in
which you have the high ground, the strategic high ground.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, I understand that, but I think there’s also,
especially among anarchists, right, we are generally skeptical of
existing statutory schemes. And so someone like you who supports some
kind of, I don’t want to call it intellectual property. You call it
informational property or now material-carried property and we can get
into the details in a second.</p>
<p>Schulman: Media-carried property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Sorry, media-carried property. You shouldn’t be in the
position of having to defend the existing patent and copyright
system.</p>
<p>Schulman: No, and I find it frustrating that most of the vitriolic
attacks on me assume that I am supporting what is being portrayed as a
monopolistic grant of privilege from the State. In my very first debate
with Wendy, I started off by saying if the concept I was putting forward
could not be defended other than as a monopolistic grant of privilege
from the State, then I would immediately abandon it.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, but the problem is, I would say, and see if you agree
with this, the vast majority of pro-IP libertarians <em>would</em>
oppose the abolition of patent and copyright, at least until we could
replace it with their ideal system. So they do not have this
abolitionist view towards …</p>
<p>Schulman: And this is where I go into my usual spiel about how I
don’t think that any kind of property, if there is in fact a property,
that there should be—there’s a statist phrase, but it’s a legal term of
art, mostly [where the nation state is].<a href="#fn954"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref954"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>954</sup></a></p>
<p>If you’re going to say that a copyright is statist, then why isn’t a
deed from the county clerk just as statist? And if you’re going to say
that we need to abolish now one, why not the other?</p>
<p>Kinsella: But you see, then I see that you’re trying to have that
both ways because you act, on the one hand, like you’re not in favor of
defending the existing patent and copyright system, but when someone
calls for abolishing it, then you sort of say, well, if we abolish that,
why not abolish real property titles?</p>
<p>Schulman: But that’s the thing. In other words, presumably you drive
a car which is registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles and
which you’re not allowed to operate without that license from the State.
And presumably the land deed issued by your county is in the same
situation, if you are in fact a homeowner. Or, if not, at one remove as
a renter from somebody who does have property which has a deed issued by
the county. And so I just don’t see the difference.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay. Well, so the problem I have with that argument, that
analogy, is you and I as libertarians don’t have much disagreement on
the basic notion that there ought to be property titles recognized in
scarce resources like land. We oppose <em>the state</em> from
monopolizing …</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, scarcity is only one of the things.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay.</p>
<p>Schulman: And I don’t see scarcity as absolute, as I discuss in my
article, “Human Property.”<a href="#fn955" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref955" role="doc-noteref"><sup>955</sup></a> Scarcity is not
absolute. I’ll refer people to that article rather than repeat
myself.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I’m just trying to pick something uncontroversial. We both
agree there should be property rights in land, right?</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes. I’m not a Henry Georgist.</p>
<p>Kinsella: And the basic function of the existing property title
records offices in the counties around the country is to just keep track
of that. Now we oppose the State monopolizing that function, but it’s
basically a correct function, a libertarian function. You can’t just
leap from that and say that similarly the copyright system does
something—crudely,<br />
perhaps—but it does a similar function because—well, for several
reasons. We don’t agree that these kinds of things should be property.
That’s what we dispute. And, you know, the property title system itself
is not terrible, the way the State runs it. It’s just that the State has
the right to come in and seize your property because of eminent
domain.</p>
<p>Schulman: Okay. Well, you see here we can get into another agreement
immediately. I think that the way that the laws have been lobbied for by
large corporations to extend and protect their claims of copyright and
patent are egregiously anti-property rights. For example—I will give you
one example in patents and another in copyright. What Monsanto did in
suing farmers whose crops were <em>invaded</em> by Monsanto’s seeds from
adjoining property …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Patented seeds, right.<a href="#fn956" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref956" role="doc-noteref"><sup>956</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: … and then sued the small farmers who had no ability to
legally defend themselves against this mega-giant corporation, I think
is one of the most horrific misuses of patent law that I can
imagine.</p>
<p>Similarly, the way that corporations such as Disney have taken things
that are traditional fairytales and copyrighted them and then
aggressively attacked people who wanted to use this stuff which
originated long before Disney got to it and sued the heck out of them to
restrict their doing so is equally egregious. Getting images and taking
paintings which hang in the Louvre and then pursue claims against people
who reproduce them, things that go back hundreds of years, is similarly
egregious. So if you are looking for Schulman to agree with Kinsella,
that the way that the State handles this is egregious, we have no
disagreement.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, let me disagree a little bit about on that. I
wouldn’t, I mean this is a quibble, but I wouldn’t call it a misuse at
all. And I wouldn’t blame Monsanto and Getty. I mean maybe they’re
immoral, but they’re using the legal rights the system gives them. In
every one, all three of the cases you mentioned, you can explain why
what they’re doing is basically supported by the copyright and patent
systems. What they’re doing is totally legitimate.<a href="#fn957"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref957"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>957</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: And I’m not going to disagree with you, but that is the
problem with all statist law. None of it supports a pure libertarian
concept of property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right.</p>
<p>Schulman: And, in fact, one of the historical reasons why
libertarians have opposed such law is that they started out with grants
from kings and other royalties. So there is an historical parallel that
the development of this body of law was corrupt going back to its
root.<a href="#fn958" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref958"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>958</sup></a> But, to me, that is an artifact of
statism itself. In other words, I would say that, in fact, the Robin
Hood story of how you have the king’s land being poached on, okay, is
just as much of an argument not to have privately held land as the
argument for grants of privilege from kings being one of the earliest
uses of artistic creation. It’s equivalent. In other words, the problem
here is not that we don’t have something which deserves to be treated as
a property right. The problem is we have the State.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I don’t think that the argument that IP is unjust is the
same as arguing that current property rights and land are unjust because
of some corruption back in the old days, because we all agree there
ought to be property rights in land and we have to have some system for
determining who the best owner is. So that’s not really
controversial.</p>
<p>Schulman: Hold on. You can’t say that we all agree.</p>
<p>Kinsella: All us libertarians, yeah.</p>
<p>Schulman: There are, in fact, communists who don’t agree.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, you and I agree, okay? You and I agree on the land
issues. That’s one difference. The other thing is, if someone asks a
libertarian, well, what would roads be like and would land title
registry be like in a free market, we would say, well, it would be
similar to what we have now. You’d have roads. It’s just they’d have
private owners and that would have different economic effects in how
they’re run and all that. We would have land title records.</p>
<p>Schulman: If you go to Cato and Reason, you’re going to find scholars
who found out that some of the earliest highways and turnpikes were, in
fact, privately created. Then you get to the long history of the
railroads where you have all sorts of statist interference.</p>
<p>Kinsella: But my point is you could use some of the existing common
law-based and other systems that we have as a rough model as to what the
libertarian system would look like, but it would be better. But you
cannot say that [re IP]. So in terms of IP, I could give 50 or 100 or
1,000 examples and you might call them misuses of the system. I would
just say this is just the implications of the current substantive law of
patent and copyright that the State has created and you would probably
agree with me on every one of those.</p>
<p>Schulman: I will immediately concede your historical point. What I
represented in 1983, beginning with my debate with Wendy, is that I was
putting forward a new natural rights theory that did not have an
historical base.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. I understand. So let’s get to something a little bit
… you and I have gone back and forth over the years, mostly in writing.
One reason that I just pinged you today was I was talking with another
gentleman, and he was questioning the IP issues, and we were talking
about it. And I was trying to explain something to him. And I made the
point, which is <em>my</em> view, which I don’t know if you completely
agree with, but I was arguing that, look, one of the fundamental
mistakes in the IP argument, or in your logorights argument I believe,
is this idea that you can own an attribute or a characteristic or a
feature of an object separate from the object itself, okay? And then I
said …</p>
<p>Schulman: And that …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Hold on …</p>
<p>Schulman: And that comes directly out of Robert LeFevre’s theory of
property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay, it may be. It’s also somewhat of an implication of
Locke. I think Locke was confused on his labor comments, etcetera, but,
… and then I said actually that Schulman has modified his logorights
characterization. You call it material-carried property, right?</p>
<p>Schulman: No, media-carried property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Sorry, I keep messing it up—media-carried property. And I
said, so basically, you view it the same as I. You just have a different
conclusion. That’s why I said, well, let’s just talk about it. And let
me just summarize quickly what I think the mistake is and you can tell
me where you think I’m wrong or what I’m missing.</p>
<p>To my mind, if you own an object, and that’s the media, that’s the
physical thing that is owned, that is always impatterned with some
information or some attributes. And, in fact, information cannot be a
free floating abstraction. Information, to exist and to be perceived and
to persist, has to be embodied in some media. Wouldn’t you agree with
that part?</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes, but let me tell you where I think you’re going where I
think that you’re not seeing what I’m seeing.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Schulman: In my view, something intangible can’t be owned, okay? For
something to be ownable, it has to be something observable in the world
and it has to be distinct and definite. Now the question which I pose,
which you said that you agreed with my formulation …</p>
<p>Kinsella: No, I don’t agree that is sufficient. That might be
necessary.</p>
<p>Schulman: Let me get this out as concisely as I can.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Alright, go ahead.</p>
<p>Schulman: If you have an alphanumeric sequence which retains its
material identity, in going from physical object to physical object, and
is a commodity separate from the things on which it is carried, which
give value, trade value, to the objects on which it is carried, but it
is transferrable from one physical entity to another, I maintain we have
now identified an object, a thing, something observable and distinct in
the real world, which is in fact a property separable from the objects
on which it is carried.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I got it but what …</p>
<p>Schulman: … and the example I gave in my debate with Wendy and have
used ever since is, you buy a book with the title <em>Atlas
Shrugged</em>. You take it home and start reading. And what you read is,
“It was the best of times. It was the worst of times”. Obviously—<em>A
Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens. It’s not the same novel.</p>
<p>But if you’re a reductionist saying that what can be owned is only a
physical object, then you have something which—for the sake of
argument—has the same number of pages, has ink impressions, has the same
binding. And so, if you were going to reduce it and say that only a
physical object can be owned, then the question arises: did you get what
you paid for? Or, if you say yes, okay, then you have now eliminated the
possibility of a novel being an existent, a thing, an entity; not an
existent so much as an entity. You’re saying that it cannot be a
thing.</p>
<p>But if you’re saying that you’re entitled to the composition of words
of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and not of <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>,
then you’re saying that the composition of words, the alphanumeric
sequence itself which is separable from the thing on which it is
carried, the media-carried property, is the economic good which is being
traded. And therefore you have an economic good which is a thing
separable from the media on which it is carried.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I get your chain of reasoning. Let me see if I can
summarize it. You tell me if I’ve got it right. You start off with the
presumption that if you can identify something as an existent, entity,
as a thing, as you call it, something that is—what was your word?
Specific and definite? You’re presupposing that that is sufficient for
ownership. Like as long as something is specific and definite and you
can give it some kind of ontological category or name and call it a
“thing,” and especially if it is valued in commerce and therefore it’s a
“commodity”—which I guess is only economic goods, not other kinds of
goods—then that’s sufficient for ownership. I just don’t see the
argument for the starting point here …</p>
<p>Schulman: No, I would say necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay but …</p>
<p>Schulman: There are other things. In my original debate with Wendy
and then in my subsequent 1983 treatise, “Informational Property:
Logorights,” I go through a whole bunch of other things that are
necessary, but they’re the same sets of questions that have to be
satisfied for any other claim of ownership.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, the way you just stated it though, you only specified
what was sufficient for ownership. I’m sorry, what was necessary for
ownership, not what was sufficient. Just because …</p>
<p>Schulman: No, I’m saying that I’ve identified a category of things
that can be owned if the same questions can be answered in the
affirmative that you would have to answer for any claim of ownership of
anything else.</p>
<p>Kinsella: See, I just don’t think, to me that doesn’t make sense, for
several reasons. Number one, and I tried to give you an example in
writing today, just as a pure contract situation. You could have a
contract and the concept of fraud, even, if you want. You don’t need to
bring fraud into this, just contract. Contract theory and property
rights alone explain why you’re not getting what you asked for when you
get the book that has the wrong pattern of information on it. In other
words, if I give you money conditioned upon the book having a certain
pattern in the book, and I don’t get that, then the money that I paid
you didn’t transfer to you because it was conditioned upon a certain
…</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, you see, it doesn’t have to be fraud. Look, I’m a
book publisher, okay? And I have in my possession an accidental artifact
of a book which I received from Lightning Source. The cover is the cover
of my novel, <em>The Rainbow Cadenza</em>, but the interior of the book
is volume one of Robert LeFevre’s autobiography. Now there was no
deliberate fraud when this was manufactured …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Let’s forget fraud, right. Let’s just assume it’s a
contract.</p>
<p>Schulman: I’m not making a legal argument so much as I’m making an
ontological argument. I’m saying that if, in fact, the composition, the
alphanumeric sequence in this particular case is different, then you
have a different thing, a different commodity.<a href="#fn959"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref959"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>959</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. But the different commodity is the physical book
which is different than another physical book because of the way it’s
impatterned. The question is: can you own the attributes of the book in
addition to the book itself? That’s the question. Can you own …</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, this is the case even when there were no copyright
laws to be enforced. In fact, you can argue … look, I will tell you
right now that the argument you’re making is one which is generally
accepted by the film and television industry. The Writers Guild treats
writing as if it’s an act of labor, but they’re much less specific on
whether the labor produces something which can be owned. And I’ll tell
you that this is something which the Writers Guild calls separation of
rights. In other words, if I as a screenwriter were to write for, let’s
say, <em>Gunsmoke</em>, it’s a work for hire because I’m basically
creating new stories based on their existing characters. But when I
write an original episode of the <em>Twilight Zone</em>, an anthology
series, they say I have separated rights unless it’s a remake of an
earlier <em>Twilight Zone</em>, such as the 1980s <em>Twilight Zone</em>
that I worked on; remade some episodes from the original Rod Serling
<em>Twilight Zone</em> from the 50s and 60s.</p>
<p>So, if I were the writer who was creating a new script based on an
original script by Richard Matheson or Charles Beaumont or Rod Serling,
then there are no separated rights because it’s a work for hire. But if
I create an original script with original story, not based on that, then
there’s a separation or rights.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, but these are just legal terms based on current
copyright. I don’t really see how that’s relevant.</p>
<p>Schulman: These are legal terms of art.</p>
<p>Kinsella: It’s not really relevant to what we’re discussing,
philosophy of what natural property rights would be. I mean you wouldn’t
have all these arcane arrangements.</p>
<p>Schulman: I am arguing, first of all, that all property exists only
as an <em>intellectual artifact</em>. And where I make this argument the
most concisely is in my essay, “Human Property.”</p>
<p>Kinsella: But didn’t you just say earlier that you don’t believe in
property in intangible things?</p>
<p>Schulman: Nothing found in nature is property. That it is basically a
human intellect which creates the concept of property itself.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, that’s true. But you could say human desire creates
it too, but that doesn’t mean desire gives rise to property rights
absent other features.</p>
<p>Schulman: No, but what we’re talking about is how human beings
interact with each other. Unlike non-intellectual animals, we do it on
the basis of intellectual construct.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay. Let me try to summarize a different way to look at it
and get your take on this. It seems to me like your argument is
basically this. You want to say, look, here’s a book. There are two
books that look identical on the outside. They have different patterns
on the inside. You would be upset if you wanted one and you got the
other. Therefore, it’s a commodity or some kind of economic good. And
because it’s an economic good, that shows that the pattern, the logos as
you call it, is an ontological thing that has existence.</p>
<p>Schulman: That’s my argument.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I don’t disagree with that as a philosophical exercise.
It’s just that you want to leap from that to saying, aha, because I’ve
identified that there’s a “thing” that has ontological existence,
therefore it can have an owner. That, to me, is the entire mistake
you’re making because you haven’t shown that that’s …</p>
<p>Schulman: … I approach this a number of different ways in my original
“Informational Property Rights,” 1983, article. And one of the ways I
approach is a <em>reduction ad absurdum</em>, using praxeology. In my
reply to Konkin, his article, “Copywrongs,” I basically deconstruct
several of his premises in which I show, using Austrian economics—a
praxeological approach—how, in fact, if you eliminate that concept, then
you basically run into the contradiction of saying that that which you
are arguing about doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>I think that it is not a coincidence that literary contracts,
regardless of whether we’re talking about copyright or not, refer to
something as the “work.” In other words, it’s a noun.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Because the copyright statute defined it that way.</p>
<p>Schulman: It’s not arguing labor. It’s arguing that there is a
<em>thing</em> that is being traded called the “work.” It is referred to
in the contracts granting rights, which I have signed—there is a term of
art called the work.</p>
<p>Kinsella: That’s just how it’s defined in the copyright statute,
though, Neil.</p>
<p>Schulman: I am saying that is a thing which is, in fact, being traded
or licensed in the same way that there is a right of occupancy which is
being traded in a rental agreement for a car or an apartment.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, okay. So the copyright statute defined that term
“work” and that’s why contracts use it now.</p>
<p>Schulman: The copyright statute is beside the point as far as I’m
concerned.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I don’t think they would use the term work if not for the
copyright statue.</p>
<p>Schulman: We’re talking plain language.</p>
<p>Kinsella: But they wouldn’t use that word if the copyright statue
hadn’t introduced it and defined it. That’s a new innovation.</p>
<p>Schulman: I’m not sure that that’s true. In other words, what you’re
arguing is which is the cart and which is the horse, and so am I. And
I’m maintaining that there is a common-sense observation in these
contracts which would survive the demise of the State and its admittedly
mucked up copyright laws.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, let me ask you this. Would you agree with me that for
your argument to work, you need to show that something having
ontological existence is sufficient for there to be property rights
possible in it? Don’t you think you need to establish that?</p>
<p>Schulman: I think that given that you need to establish the same
boundary issues that you would with other forms of property and
contracts, that, yes, it qualifies as being entered into the running as
a possible type of property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: My point is you have to show it, though. That is a
presupposition of your argument, that establishing that something is of
ontological existence, is an existent, is sufficient for it to be
ownable. You have to prove that.</p>
<p>Schulman: It is necessary to qualify it for the debate on whether or
not it is a property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I mean, my view on this, I’m very Randian in my
epistemology, my concept theory. I just think what you’re doing, is you
are doing reification in a sense. You’re conflating the efficiency and
the usefulness and the practicality of certain concepts with calling
something “existing” and then leaping to the point where it can be
owned.</p>
<p>Like, so for example, I think the concept of love is a valid concept.
It has a referent in the world. You can say there “is” love. But just
because we have identified an ontological type of thing that
exists—love—doesn’t mean it’s a type of thing that can be owned. You
have to do more than establish the validity of a concept to show that
the referent of the concept is an ownable thing. I mean we have time. We
have motion.</p>
<p>Schulman: I agree with that, but that, in fact, when you’re
identifying something which exists … look, love is something which is an
expression, okay? And it is something which may be observable in human
behavior but it is not something which you can identify as existing
outside of human behavior in the way that an alphanumeric sequence is. I
maintain that an alphanumeric sequence is, in fact, a thing.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Hold on a second. Earlier you said …</p>
<p>Schulman: An array of photographic frames is an observable thing in
the real world.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Not outside of human behavior … you said earlier that
property doesn’t even exist, right?</p>
<p>Schulman: Just in the real world.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Hold on. You said property doesn’t even exist outside of
human intentions and human subjective evaluation. So how could
alphanumeric sequences in something called a movie exist without regard
for human intention?</p>
<p>Schulman: Okay, because “thingness” is one of the necessary, but not
sufficient, conditions for a claim of ownership. Ownership is about
action and intellectual creation of identity and … look, I would say
that the identity exists independent, the thing exists. This is why it’s
both an ontological and an epistemological question before you get to
the moral and legal questions. What I think that my work has done is
establish the ontological and epistemological basis for these
media-carried objects to be identified as ownable in the same way that
other things can be ownable according to the general common sense
principles of contract.</p>
<p>Kinsella: No, I understand your general thrust, but you seem to be
agreeing because you say it on occasion. You seem to be agreeing with me
that “thingness,” which is just another way of saying something
exists—or in my view it just means it’s a valid concept—thingness is a
necessary but not sufficient condition. That’s why I keep saying … I
just want to make sure you agree with me …</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes, that’s what I’m saying.</p>
<p>Kinsella: But you need to …</p>
<p>Schulman: Necessary but not sufficient. But the sufficiency is by
applying the exact same question that you would for any other claim of
property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yes, I understand. We don’t have time to get into that, but
in your argument, in your logorights article and, I think, in your …
what’s the other, “Human Rights”? What’s it called? “Human
Property”?</p>
<p>Schulman: Property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, in that one I think you try to give reasons why you
think it is sufficient. I don’t agree with you on that, but I think
that’s really the crux of our disagreement. But before …</p>
<p>Schulman: Can we at least come to the point where you think it is
debatable, within the realm of possibility?</p>
<p>Kinsella: Honestly, I don’t, Neil. But it’s only because I’ve thought
about it so much and I can see no way that you can own the
characteristic of an object without that being a universal that gives
you property rights in other people’s owned resources.<a href="#fn960"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref960" role="doc-noteref"><sup>960</sup></a>
In other words, to my mind, information …</p>
<p>Schulman: And here’s where I’m saying, that the defining distinction,
which makes it possible, is that it is something outside of one human
being. It’s something that now exists in the world. At the point where
it exists in the world, separate from the person who brought it into
existence, now you have something real.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Let me ask you this. Is your view here, is it Platonic or
mystical at all? Because I know you’re a little bit mystical, more than
I am, on some spiritual issues.<a href="#fn961" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref961" role="doc-noteref"><sup>961</sup></a> So does this view,
because it seems to me …</p>
<p>Schulman: Back in 1983 when I was making these arguments, I was an
atheist.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I’m asking about now though. I understand. But do you think
there is anything mystical or Platonic about what you’re saying? You
seem to envision these …</p>
<p>Schulman: Only in the sense that Ayn Rand used the term
“spiritual.”</p>
<p>Kinsella: No, I don’t mean that. I mean it’s like you’re envisioning
the separate sort of ghostly existence of these Platonic objects that
are out there, independent, ontologically separate from the…</p>
<p>Schulman: I don’t accept a Platonic metaphysics.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well would you agree that information has to be … hold on.
Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Schulman: Let me say this. I have made the argument that there is no
such thing as a virtual reality, that either something is real or it
isn’t. You go back to the movie <em>The Matrix</em>, okay? And in fact
there were these bodies …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. There’s always an underlying
media or underlying …</p>
<p>Schulman: That was a reality.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, there is a substrate. I understand. I agree with you
on that. But my point is, wouldn’t you agree that information—these
alphanumeric sequences you’re talking about—they’re always embedded in
some substrate or some media. They have to be just the impatterning
<em>of a thing</em>. Wouldn’t you agree with that?</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes, yes. And that’s why I talk about
media-<em>carried</em> property. And the question is whether or not
there is something separable which can be transferred from physical
object to physical object to physical object. And that is the
distinction which makes it a thing in and of itself.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, let’s forget about whether it’s separable. Let me ask
you this. If all information has to be embodied or impatterned in a
media, don’t you agree the media has an owner? That physical thing that
is the media has some owner.</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes. And the ownership of that can be separated from the
ownership of the thing which is carried.</p>
<p>Kinsella: It <em>can</em> be …. I suppose it could be. But how does
the fact that someone writes a novel give them the ability to control
the media that <em>other</em> people own?</p>
<p>Schulman: Because there is a thing being carried for which property
rights have not been transferred.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Hold on, hold on. Give me thirty seconds. Hold on. Neil,
hold on. I’ve got to answer the door. Hold on thirty seconds. Neil,
thirty seconds.</p>
<p>Schulman: If you book a ride with Uber, your claim to a ride is a
usage which is separable from ownership of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Neil, sorry. I had to answer the door. Sorry. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Schulman: I’ll repeat that because I don’t know if you heard it. I’m
saying that it is separable in the same way that if you book a ride with
Uber, what you’re buying is a use, but you’re not buying the Uber
vehicle itself.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, I agree some things are separable, mostly by contract
or by co-ownership arrangements. But that doesn’t mean that you can
control what other people do with their property unless you have a good
reason. I go with the Lockean and Rothbardian theory of property.</p>
<p>Schulman: Hold on. You’re making an assumption. You’re begging the
question. You’re saying you’re restricting what other people can do with
their property. I’m maintaining that what is being argued over is, in
fact, what is not being transferred to somebody else and what they
cannot do because it is not their property.<a href="#fn962"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref962"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>962</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, but there’s not always a transfer. So, for example,
let’s take the patent case. Okay, if you claim a property right in being
the owner of this mousetrap design, alright? Now if I am toiling away in
my garage with my own wood and steel, my own substrate, and I configure
it into a certain shape, you can use the patent system to tell me I
can’t sell that. I can’t even make that device. Now where was the
transfer?</p>
<p>Schulman: You know, Stephan, I have to say that over the years I have
become a lot less sanguine over arguing about patent rather than
copyright.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay.</p>
<p>Schulman: I think the case for a patent is a harder case than arguing
for what I’ve been calling media-carried property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, let me do kind of a lightning round with you because
there are some things I want to talk to you about because you know a lot
of things about the history and Konkin and these things. Not to dwell
too much on them. Let me just get your take on some things.</p>
<p>Number one, let’s just stick with copyright, because you think that
is some rough system that approximates something like, might, could
exist in a free society. Do you think that the time limits on copyrights
should be finite and arbitrary, or perpetual?</p>
<p>Schulman: I think that for media-carried property, you ask the exact
same question that you would for ownership of any other kind of
property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: So the problem with the copyright system is that it expires
at about 120 years. In your view, it should last forever.</p>
<p>Schulman: Yeah, but again you’re talking about a statist defined
system.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I understand but one defect of the system is that …</p>
<p>Schulman: They could also arbitrarily say that land ownership ends
with death and can’t be carried …</p>
<p>Kinsella: I know. I just want to get you on record and see what you
think. I mean you do realize the original copyright act was about
fourteen years.</p>
<p>Schulman: All I’m saying is that when approaching this question, I
think you need to satisfy the same requirements that you would for
ownership and transfer of any other kind of property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Are you aware, by the way, that Jefferson, when the Bill of
Rights was being considered, he wrote a letter to Madison and he
proposed … because at that time the copyright clause was already in the
Constitution, right, 1789. But for the Bill of Rights, Jefferson
proposed amending the Bill of Rights, or adding a provision to the Bill
of Rights saying that the State can grant these monopolies, by which he
meant copyright and patent, but only for x years. So he wanted to put a
time limit in there. You know, probably fourteen years.<a href="#fn963"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref963"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>963</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: Yeah, Jefferson, like Locke, was taking a utilitarian
approach. I’m not. I wrote an entire novel, <em>The Rainbow
Cadenza</em>, attacking the concept of utilitarianism being sufficient
to come up with fairness. I’m an absolute believer in theories of
natural law and natural rights. And I would say that would separate me
from Jefferson and Locke.</p>
<p>Kinsella: So in your system, you couldn’t even republish the Bible or
Shakespeare’s plays or Homer’s works without getting some permission
from some long lost descendent down the line. You would have to
permission for everything. There would be a complete permission culture
for all ideas.</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, I mean, again, I expand the question to every other
sort of property.</p>
<p>Kinsella: So that’s a yes.</p>
<p>Schulman: In other words, do we need to get permission from the heirs
of the Roman emperors before we can take a tour of the Colosseum?</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay. So let me ask you this one, about Konkin. You
mentioned that he didn’t oppose people using copyright, or in some
cases, and LeFevre either. I mean, of course, I don’t either. I’ve
gotten copyrights on my works and used it before …</p>
<p>Schulman: Sam did not copyright his own works and Robert LeFevre did
not copyright his own works.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, you realize that copyright is automatic. So that is
actually not true. They do have copyright in their work. As soon as you
write something, you have a copyright.</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, according to the State. But, I mean, are we … these
are two people who did not recognize the authority of the State to
define these questions.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, but they had copyright in their works, whether they
wanted it or not.</p>
<p>Schulman: According to the State but not according to their own
preferences.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, yeah, but someone couldn’t, someone can’t go publish
one of LeFevre’s books right now without getting permission from
someone, even though LeFevre himself might have opposed copyright,
unless he put some kind of license …</p>
<p>Schulman: That would be the case if it were an unpublished work. Then
that argument could be made. In fact, I will tell you where this arises
in a practical sense. As far as I know, the only copy of the manuscript
for Samuel Edward Konkin, III’s <em>Counter-Economics</em> is in the
hands of Victor Koman. And Victor Koman has published other of Sam’s
works which were first published when Sam was alive. And Sam explicitly
published them without a copyright.</p>
<p>Kinsella: No, that’s not true. You can’t publish something without a
copyright.</p>
<p>Schulman: The legal rights to this are held by the Konkin estate,
which devolves upon Sam’s brother, Alan Konkin, in which Alan has made
me the literary executor. So Victor is in the position of having the
only manuscript, the only physical manuscript, which he refuses to
provide to the estate. But he cannot legally publish it himself …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Correct.</p>
<p>Schulman: … without permission from the estate.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. Well, this is just the kind of bizarre logic that
comes from any type of IP system, I believe. You can blame the State’s
copyright system but I think it’s just the logic of copyright. You’re
going to get these absurd and obviously unjust and obscene results. It’s
just an inevitable part of separating the idea of ownership from scarce
resources.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you. You mentioned earlier that in your earlier
arguments you tried to rely on praxeology to support your case. I think
praxeology …</p>
<p>Schulman: In my original 1983 article, “Informational Property:
Logorights,” Sam makes what he represents as a praxeological case and so
I responded with a praxeological case.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. And then what I was going to say is I think that
praxeology, especially Mises’s version of the Austrian economics, is
absolutely crucial, and indeed essential, to getting these issues
straight. But I think it points in the other direction. I think that
praxeology, basically, regards human action as the employment, right,
the conscious, purposeful <em>employment of scarce means</em> to achieve
something in the world, <em>guided by knowledge</em>.<a href="#fn964"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref964" role="doc-noteref"><sup>964</sup></a>
So praxeology views human action …</p>
<p>Schulman: Let’s start out with the first premise of Austrian
economics, which I almost parodied in the first line of my novel,
<em>Alongside Night</em>.<a href="#fn965" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref965" role="doc-noteref"><sup>965</sup></a> Mises argues human
beings act to remove felt unease.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Correct. That’s their purpose. That’s their motivation,
right.</p>
<p>Schulman: First line of the novel: “Elliot Vreeland felt uneasy the
moment he entered his classroom.”</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right. And I think that’s a brilliant aspect of praxeology,
but it only goes to the motives or the purpose. What human action
<em>is</em>, is the <em>employment of scarce means</em>, which you can
call scarce resources, <em>guided by knowledge</em>. So there are two
important components to successful human action. One is the availability
…</p>
<p>Schulman: Mises then goes on, through a whole series of deductive
derivations on that premise.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I know. I’m just focusing on the bare structure … I just
want to get your take on this okay? My argument is very simple. And I
think Mises is right. When we act in the world, we’re trying to achieve
an outcome, right, to remove felt uneasiness or to achieve something at
the end of the process, but we do it by employing scarce means that are
causally effective in the world, and we do it by using our knowledge to
decide what to do. So you have to have knowledge <em>and</em> you have
to have scarce means. Property rights apply to the second …</p>
<p>Schulman: But you see, again, and I think that I made this argument
in one of my other articles responding to that video, <em>Copying is Not
Theft</em>.<a href="#fn966" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref966"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>966</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: By Nina Paley.</p>
<p>Schulman: I responded to that … I think it’s linked in an article
called <em>The Libertarian Case for IP</em>. I’m basically saying that
scarcity is itself a limited concept. In other words, that it is a
relative concept … That there is no requirement for absolute scarcity.
It merely needs to be scarcity within a particular context.</p>
<p>Kinsella: But what do you mean when you say you’re opposed to
intangible property and that you think all information is in a media? A
media is a scarce physical resource. Land is a scarce, physical
resource.</p>
<p>Schulman: I’m arguing that if there is an alphanumeric sequence, for
example, then that alphanumeric sequence is a unique object. There’s
only one of it …</p>
<p>Kinsella: I know you think it’s a unique object.</p>
<p>Schulman: … therefore, if there’s only one of something, it’s by
definition scarce.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay, but let’s go back. I want to just finish this very
short praxeological argument and see what you think is wrong with it,
because you keep stopping me before I get to the end, and it’s very
simple. We employ scarce means. That is, you manipulate things in the
world that can have a cause and effect. But to do that, you have to have
some idea of what causality is, what physics laws are. And you have to
have some idea of what’s possible and what you’re going to achieve. So
knowledge is in your head. It guides your choice of means and your
choice of ends. So every action is the employment of scarce means
<em>and</em> the use of knowledge. Would you agree with that?</p>
<p>Schulman: I would say that that is a chain of reasoning which
precedes the possibility of property, yes.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, I’m just saying that it’s inconceivable to imagine
human action that doesn’t employ scarce means and that isn’t guided by
knowledge. Correct?</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, … uh … yes, but there’s the possibility of human
action acting on something which is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah right. That’s the general condition of human
action.</p>
<p>Schulman: In doing so, converting something from ubiquitous to
scarce.</p>
<p>Kinsella: That’s possible. I’m just saying the structure of action is
that <em>every</em> single human action <em>has</em> to employ scarce
means and <em>has</em> to be guided by knowledge. It’s just
inconceivable without it.</p>
<p>Schulman: In a sense …</p>
<p>Kinsella: But wait. Do you agree with that or not?</p>
<p>Schulman: Hold on. Let me try to answer your question. I think that
human action is itself a scarcity [Kinsella sighs] and therefore the
employment of human action on something else has at least the potential
to satisfy the conditions of creating a scarce something.<a
href="#fn967" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref967"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>967</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinsella: That’s fine but I’m not talking about the end results of
your action. The end result of an action <em>does not need to be the
acquisition of a scarce resource or the ownership of some object</em>.
The end of an action can be anything. It can be totally subjective,
right? It might be to get a little girl to smile after you do a card
trick for her.<a href="#fn968" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref968"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>968</sup></a></p>
<p>Schulman: No, no. Hold on. The reason that the human mind affects an
action is not the same thing, and I would say that there is a
disconnect. Once the results of that action produce an etching in the
real world, which is separate from the actor and observable by other
actors.</p>
<p>Kinsella: I know. Okay, but you’re getting … I’m not trying … I’m
just talking about—if you view human action praxeologically as the
employment of scarce means to achieve an end, and the action that you
take is guided by knowledge, that that shows that knowledge, or
information …</p>
<p>Schulman: We’re having a communication artifact problem at the
moment. What you just said verbally. Can you say it again please?</p>
<p>Kinsella: Oh sorry. What I’m trying to say is my understanding of the
way property norms arise and the way they relate to Mises’s economic
understanding of …</p>
<p>Schulman: Oh geez. I’m sorry Stephan. What you’re talking I’m not
hearing verbally … try saying it one more time.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Test, test, test. Can you hear me now? Hello? Test.
Neil?</p>
<p>Schulman: Yeah, I’m not really getting anything. Do you want to stop
the recording and call me back and start it again?</p>
<p>Kinsella: … Sure. I’ll do that right now. Sorry about that. Yeah,
let’s just finish it up quickly. What I’m doing is calling you on one
iPhone and I’m recording it over the air on another. A very low tech
solution because everything is always glitchy in technology. In fact,
why don’t we wrap it up. Yeah, let’s just wrap it up. I told you what I
wanted. I was just running an alternative praxeological theory by you.
The basic argument is that you need property rights in the scarce means
that are essential to human action, but you <em>cannot</em> have
property rights in the knowledge that guides human action because that’s
not a scarce human resource.</p>
<p>Schulman: I agree with you. I’m not making a knowledge argument.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Well, you do believe in informational property. So you
think there are property rights in information.</p>
<p>Schulman: I believe that information <em>per se</em> cannot be owned
but an information <em>object</em> can be. And that is a crucial
distinction.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Okay. Okay. Well, I think …</p>
<p>Schulman: In the same way that you can’t own matter, but you can own
things made out of matter. You can’t own information but you can own
things made out of information.</p>
<p>Kinsella: So like, if you own a horseshoe, you don’t own the matter
in the horseshoe. You only own the way the matter is shaped?</p>
<p>Schulman: I’m sorry. Say that again please.</p>
<p>Kinsella: So like, if you own a horseshoe, you don’t own the metal
matter of the horseshoe. You only own the way the horseshoe is
shaped?</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, again, you own the <em>thing</em> which is the
horseshoe. You own the thing which is the horseshoe, in the same way
that, if you own a novel, you own the thing that is the novel.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Let me ask you this …</p>
<p>Schulman: Which is the part of the thing on which it is in the same
way that you can own the horseshoe without owning the horse.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, but … so let’s suppose lightning strikes the
horseshoe and melts it. And now you have a puddle of molten iron. Do you
own that or have you lost the ownership of it because it’s not a
horseshoe anymore?</p>
<p>Schulman: Let me ask you this. If you own a house and the house burns
down, do you own the ashes?</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yes, I would say that because I don’t believe that the
ownership of the house is dependent upon its shape.</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, here we have an interesting thing because unless the
sole copy of a thing is destroyed, then you have something which is
durable. And destroying a carrier of it does not necessarily destroy the
thing which is carried.</p>
<p>Kinsella: But it does, because you can’t have information without
some media that it’s carried in.</p>
<p>Schulman: Yes and …</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah, there could be multiple copies of it. I know.</p>
<p>Schulman: And here is a case where there needs to be at least one
surviving carrier.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Right, but this also implies there could be multiple copies
of it. You see, you want to call it one object.</p>
<p>Schulman: There could be multiple copies. But the way that I would
phrase that is, what is the variable is the number of carriers. There is
still only unique object which is being carried.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Yeah. So it’s a universal or it’s a Platonic … that’s why I
say it’s a Platonic object, to me, it seems like.</p>
<p>Schulman: No, I can understand why, from a philosophical standpoint,
this concept could be regarded by Plato as Platonic. However, I am not a
Platonist and I’m not making a Platonic argument. There it is. I believe
that Aristotle had the concept of the atom but later science started
talking about electrons and neutrons and protons and sub-particles
called quarks. So just because the language seems to say something which
was said by the ancients doesn’t mean it’s equivalent.</p>
<p>Kinsella: Sure. Sure. Anyway, I’m going to tie it up now. I’m a
little upset with you because I asked you to keep this to thirty minutes
and you insisted on going a whole hour, Neil.</p>
<p>Schulman: I’m sorry. How much did we actually use?</p>
<p>Kinsella: [Laughs] No, I’m just joking. I don’t know because I have
it broken up. Probably about an hour and five minutes.</p>
<p>Schulman: Well, I don’t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>Kinsella: No, no, I’m joking.</p>
<p>Schulman: But then again, you and I have no problem being
loquacious.</p>
<p>Kinsella: That’s true. That’s true. Well, I appreciate your time and
your sincerity on this issue. I think for now we’ll have to agree to
disagree, but at least people can listen to this and see where you’re
coming from and evaluate the different ways of looking at this
stuff.</p>
<p>Schulman: I appreciate it very much. Thank you.</p>
<p>Kinsella: All right Neil. Hold on, hold on after I stop and we’ll
chat. Talk to you later. Thanks man.</p>
<p>Schulman: Okay.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-18-goods-scarce-and-nonscarce">Chapter 18: Goods, Scarce
and Nonscarce</h3>
<p>Originally published in 2010, with co-author Jeffrey
Tucker.<sup>*</sup> This emerged out of many discussions he and I had
about intellectual property and our respective writings on this topic. I
have revised and updated the original article,<sup>†</sup> which
included this authors’ note: “Special thanks to BK Marcus, Doug French,
Jeffrey Herbener, Raymond Walter, David Gordon, Robert Murphy, and<br />
Joseph Salerno for comments.”</p>
<p><sup>*</sup> Jeffrey A. Tucker &amp; Stephan Kinsella, “Goods, Scarce
and Nonscarce,” <em>Mises Daily</em> (Aug. 25, 2010).</p>
<p><sup>†</sup> My co-author has reviewed the changes made in this
chapter and fully agrees with them.</p>
<p>Everyone who is serious about ideas now has to deal with the issue of
“intellectual property,” especially given the advent of digital media
and the state’s war on the supposed violators of the intellectual rights
of others. The situation has at once become very hopeful, with more
sharing of ideas than ever before in history, and extremely grim, with
the federal government pressuring every internet-service provider to act
as proxy enforcers of an unjust law—and twisting the arms of developing
countries to adopt draconian, Western-style IP law.<a href="#fn969"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref969"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>969</sup></a></p>
<p>This debate, however, involves more than just IP issues. The
discussion surrounding this topic has further clarified other issues,
like the character of goods and property, the existence and centrality
of nonscarce goods in economic life, and the role of learning in the
evolution of society. This partially accounts for why the IP topic is so
hot: it causes us to revisit fundamental issues over property,
ownership, competition, and other areas we’ve mistakenly taken for
granted. What follows is a summary of some fundamental ideas many of us
batted around this summer.<a href="#fn970" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref970" role="doc-noteref"><sup>970</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="scarcity-and-scarce-goods">SCARCITY AND SCARCE GOODS</h4>
<p>“Why are tangible goods property?” This is a central question of
<em>Against Intellectual Property</em>. Or more precisely: why are
there, or why should there be, property rights in material, corporeal,
scarce resources? The reason for property rights is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the fact that there can be conflict over these goods by multiple
human actors. The very possibility of <em>conflict</em> over a resource
renders it scarce, giving rise to the need for ethical rules to govern
its use. Thus, the fundamental social and ethical function of property
rights is to prevent interpersonal conflict over scarce resources.<a
href="#fn971" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref971"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>971</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this point, we can cite Hoppe’s <em>Theory of Socialism and
Capitalism</em>, where Hoppe writes with singular clarity: “only because
scarcity exists is there even a problem of formulating moral laws;
insofar as goods are superabundant (‘free’ goods), no conflict over the
use of goods is possible and no action-coordination is needed.”<a
href="#fn972" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref972"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>972</sup></a> The logic for this insight Hoppe
draws from Rothbard, and the term “free goods” he takes from Mises.<a
href="#fn973" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref973"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>973</sup></a> (As for the term “goods” itself,
it is used by Austrians more or less as a synonym for the <em>scarce
means of action</em>.)<a href="#fn974" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref974" role="doc-noteref"><sup>974</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoppe writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To develop the concept of property, it is necessary for goods to be
scarce, so that conflicts over the use of these goods can possibly
arise. It is the function of property rights to avoid such possible
clashes over the use of scarce resources by assigning rights of
exclusive ownership. Property is thus a normative concept: a concept
designed to make a conflict-free interaction possible by stipulating
mutually binding rules of conduct (norms) regarding scarce resources.<a
href="#fn975" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref975"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>975</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in the case of the Garden of Eden, where superabundance would
mean that all things we ever wanted were in our grasp, Hoppe explains
that there would still be a need for property rights. This is because
the human body itself is scarce: choices about who can use it and how it
can be used necessarily exclude other choices. One cannot simultaneously
eat an apple, smoke a cigarette, climb a tree, and build a house.
Likewise, as Hoppe notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… because of the scarcity of body and time, even in the Garden of
Eden property regulations would have to be established. Without them,
and assuming now that more than one person exists, that their range of
action overlaps, and that there is no preestablished harmony and
synchronization of interests among these persons, conflicts over the use
of one’s own body would be unavoidable. I might, for instance, want to
use my body to enjoy drinking a cup of tea, while someone else might
want to start a love affair with it, thus preventing me from having my
tea and also reducing the time left to pursue my own goals by means of
this body. In order to avoid such possible clashes, rules of exclusive
ownership must be formulated. In fact, so long as there is action, there
is a necessity for the establishment of property norms.<a href="#fn976"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref976"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>976</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A property right in one’s scarce body is a precondition for action
even in the face of superabundance. Hoppe goes so far as to say that the
body is the “prototype of a scarce good.”<a href="#fn977"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref977" role="doc-noteref"><sup>977</sup></a>
Here he agrees with Jefferson’s teacher Count Destutt de Tracy:
“property exists in nature: for it is impossible that every one should
not be the proprietor of his individuality and of his faculties.”<a
href="#fn978" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref978"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>978</sup></a></p>
<p>As Hoppe writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer to the question what makes my body “mine” lies in the
obvious fact that this is not merely an assertion but that, for everyone
to see, this <em>is</em> indeed the case. Why do we say, “This is my
body”? For this, a twofold requirement exists. On the one hand it must
be the case that the body called “mine” must indeed (in an
intersubjectively ascertainable way) express or “objectify” my will.
Proof of this, as far as my body is concerned, is easy enough to
demonstrate: When I announce that I will now lift my arm, turn my head,
relax in my chair (or whatever else) and these announcements then become
true (are fulfilled), then this shows that the body which does this has
been indeed appropriated by my will. If, to the contrary, my
announcements showed no systematic relation to my body’s actual
behavior, then the proposition “this is my body” would have to be
considered as an empty, objectively unfounded assertion; and likewise
this proposition would be rejected as incorrect if following my
announcement not my arm would rise but always that of Müller, Meier, or
Schulze (in which case one would more likely be inclined to consider
Müller’s, Meier’s, or Schulze’s body “mine”). On the other hand, apart
from demonstrating that my will has been “objectified” in the body
called “mine,” it must be demonstrated that my appropriation has
<em>priority</em> as compared to the possible appropriation of the same
body by another person.</p>
<p>As far as bodies are concerned, it is also easy to prove this. We
demonstrate it by showing that it is under my <em>direct</em> control,
while every other person can objectify (express) itself in my body only
<em>indirectly</em>, i.e., by means of their own bodies, and direct
control must obviously have logical-temporal priority (precedence) as
compared to any indirect control. The latter simply follows from the
fact that any indirect control of a good by a person presupposes the
direct control of this person regarding his own body; thus, in order for
a scarce good to become justifiably appropriated, the appropriation of
one’s directly controlled “own” body must already be
<em>presupposed</em> as justified. It thus follows: If the justice of an
appropriation by means of direct control must be presupposed by any
further-reaching indirect appropriation, and if only I have direct
control of my body, then no one except me can ever justifiably own my
body (or, put differently, then property in/of my body cannot be
transferred onto another person), and every attempt of an indirect
control of my body by another person must, unless I have explicitly
agreed to it, be regarded as unjust(ified).<a href="#fn979"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref979"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>979</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let’s be clear what we do <em>not</em> mean by the term scarce in
the sense that it applies to this discussion. Something can have zero
price and still be scarce: a mud pie, soup with a fly in it, a computer
that won’t boot. So long as no one wants these things, they are not
economic goods. And yet, in their physical nature, they are scarce
because if someone did want them, and they thus became goods, there
could be contests over their possession and use. They would have to be
allocated by either violence or market exchange based on property
rights.</p>
<p>Nor does scarcity necessarily refer to whether a good is in shortage
or surplus, nor to whether there are only a few or whether there are
many. There can be a single “owner” of a nonscarce good (a poem I just
thought of, which I can share with you without your taking it away from
me) or a billion owners of scarce goods (paperclips, which, despite
their ubiquity, are still an economic good).</p>
<p>Nor does scarcity necessarily refer to tangibility only, to the
ability to physically manipulate the thing, or to the ability to
perceive something with the senses; airspace and radio airwaves<a
href="#fn980" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref980"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>980</sup></a> are intangible scarce goods and
therefore potentially held as property and therefore priced, while fire
is an example of a tangible good of potentially unlimited supply.</p>
<p>Instead, the term scarcity here refers to the possible existence of
conflict over the possession of a finite thing. It means that a
condition of contestable control exists for anything that cannot be
simultaneously owned: my ownership and control excludes your
control.</p>
<h4 id="replication-and-nonscarce-goods">REPLICATION AND NONSCARCE
GOODS</h4>
<p>In contrast, there are nonscarce goods. A classic statement on them
comes from Frank Fetter’s <em>Economic Principles</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[S]ome things, even such as are indispensable to existence, may yet,
because of their abundance, fail to be objects of desire and of choice.
Such things are called <em>free goods</em>. They have no value in the
sense in which the economist uses that term. Free goods are things which
exist in superfluity; that is, in quantities sufficient not only to
gratify but also to satisfy all the desires which may depend on them.<a
href="#fn981" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref981"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>981</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of a necessarily nonscarce good is a thing in demand that
can be replicated without limit, so that I can have one, you can have
one, and we can all have one. This is a condition under which there can
be no contest over ownership. As Hoppe observes, under these conditions,
there would be no need for property norms governing their ownership and
use.</p>
<p>This nonscarce status might apply to many things but it always
applies to nonfinite things, that is, goods that can be copied without
limit, with no additional copy having displaced the previous copy and
with no degradation in the quality of the copied good from the original
good.</p>
<p>Jefferson himself made the lasting statement that clearly
distinguishes the two types of goods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an
idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it
to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of
it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less,
because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea
from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who
lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That
ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the
moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,
seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when
she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening
their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move,
and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of
property.<a href="#fn982" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref982"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>982</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is not just the spawn of Enlightenment thought.
St. Augustine also took note of the peculiar goods quality of words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The words I am uttering penetrate your senses, so that every hearer
holds them, yet withholds them from no other. … I have no worry that, by
giving all to one, the others are deprived. I hope, instead, that
everyone will consume everything; so that, denying no other ear or mind,
you take all to yourselves, yet leave all to all others. But for
individual failures of memory, everyone who came to hear what I say can
take it all off, each on one’s separate way.<a href="#fn983"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref983"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>983</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine if Jefferson’s and Augustine’s descriptions of ideas applied
to finite things. Let’s say that someone owns a magic bagel. He could
give a friend a bagel and another would magically appear in its place,
allowing him to keep his bagel at the same time. The very act of giving
it away would create an exact copy of it. A neighbor could do the same.
Potentially, everyone in the world could have an identical bagel—all
equally delicious.</p>
<p>This magic bagel would then constitute what has been traditionally
called a free good or what we are now calling a nonscarce good—something
that can be possessed unto infinity and by an unlimited number of people
without displacing or degrading the original. With free goods, or
nonscarce goods, there is no conflict over ownership.</p>
<p>You could say that you have a property right in the magic bagel, but
it would be meaningless because anyone could “take it” by the act of
replicating it. It cannot be owned in the traditional sense. I could of
course keep my magic bagel under wraps and never let anyone know about
it. But that changes nothing about its magic properties. It remains a
good that can be copied without limit. And my ability to keep the secret
is a result of my property right in—my ability to control—the scarce
resource of my body.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the status of the bagel as a free good is due
to its <em>replicability</em>. If it could not be so replicated, if its
magic went away, it would become a scarce good. Once it became public,
there would be a contest over ownership of that bagel (if I have it, you
can’t have it).</p>
<p>So it is with all things: if there is a zero-sum contest over its
possession, it is scarce; if there need not be rivalry over its
ownership, and its capacity for copying and sharing is infinite, it is
nonscarce.</p>
<p>Does that sound fanciful? With regard to bagels, it is. But what if
something like the magic-bagel example becomes real? Yesterday we could
replicate information with photocopiers and print any number of perfect
copies with a laser printer; and now we can copy and reproduce documents
and files digitally. What if so-called 3D printers become widespread?
These are devices that can fabricate various material objects by using a
“recipe.” In principle one could see a bagel (or car) that he likes,
find or create a blueprint or recipe for it, and have a copy printed
using one’s own 3D printer, energy, and raw materials.</p>
<p>One can only imagine the IP police stopping people from using their
3D printers to make useful tools and goods based on the idea that doing
so is somehow “stealing” the property of others that is still sitting in
their homes.<a href="#fn984" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref984"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>984</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, for now the technology for 3D copying and printing is in
its infancy. Not so for digitally encoded information. For example,
consider a file on your hard drive. It can be packaged up and sent via
email. The file does not disappear. A perfect copy of that file appears
in someone else’s email. That person could similarly forward (a copy of)
the file to another person. This can happen billions and trillions of
times without compromising the integrity of the first file. In effect,
this file is like the magic bagel, a nonscarce good. If the file is on a
server, it can be accessed by billions of people, each of whom could
similarly host the file until it multiplies without limit.<a
href="#fn985" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref985"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>985</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider the power of this nonscarce good. That file might contain a
database with all the world’s financial transactions for last month. The
record of those transactions would be nonscarce. The file could contain
images of all the paintings in the National Gallery of Art. These images
would be nonscarce. It could contain videos of all college lectures
given in the United States last semester. Again, nonscarce.</p>
<p>All of this is possible and practicable. We experience this every
day. We do this every day. All the files on the World Wide Web, unless
they have been specially coded to be otherwise, constitute free
goods.</p>
<p>It seems clear that we are moving into a world in which we have to
account for the existence of massive and growing numbers of goods that
are not scarce, in the sense that they are potentially replicable into
infinity. These goods fall outside the strict confines needed for
rationing. There need be no conflict and hence no need for traditional
property rights for them.</p>
<h4 id="goods-scarce-and-nonscarce">GOODS, SCARCE AND NONSCARCE</h4>
<p>One helpful way to understand this is to classify all goods as either
finite and therefore normally scarce or nonfinite and therefore
naturally nonscarce. This distinction appears from time to time in the
history of thought.<a href="#fn986" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref986"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>986</sup></a> Property rights are essential for
scarce goods. It is these scarce goods that serve as means for action,
while nonscarce goods that can be copied without displacing the original
are not <em>means</em> but <em>guides</em> for action.<a href="#fn987"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref987" role="doc-noteref"><sup>987</sup></a>
It would be ridiculous to speak of some kind of “social ownership” over
scarce goods.<a href="#fn988" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref988"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>988</sup></a> Scarce goods can only be owned by
one person at a time. Sure, you can share them, but that is just a means
of allocating a scarce good that changes nothing about the intrinsic
nature of the good. In the end, all attempts at socializing scarce
resources lead to state ownership and the well-known chaos associated
with it.</p>
<p>But let us return to the bagel, this time one without magic
properties. What about the recipe and skills that made it? The recipe
and skills can be copied by anyone. Anyone can watch and learn. The
recipe can be shared unto infinity. Once the information in the recipe
and the techniques of making it are released, they are free goods,
nonscarce goods, or nonfinite goods.</p>
<p>What are some more examples of such naturally nonscarce goods? One
person can share an idea and it can spread unto infinity, never reducing
or degrading the quality of the original. Fire might be considered
another example (as Thomas Jefferson said). A match can light a log
without displacing the fire from the match. The times tables are another
example: the grade-school teacher doesn’t “give up” this knowledge when
drilling it into the students. An image of anything qualifies too. One
person can look at another and memorize what he or she sees, without
somehow taking or replacing the original. A tune is the same way. It can
be shared and replicated without limit. I can sing a song, and you can
sing the same song without taking the song from me.</p>
<p>These goods are all nonscarce and thereby require no economization,
and no property rights, as no conflict is possible. Once they are
released, they need not be priced. There is no “structure of production”
attached to their reproduction or allocation (hence there is no
“structure of production” for the dissemination of ideas).</p>
<p>To be sure, nonscarce goods <em>can</em> be economized and thereby
commercialized by rationing the scarce means of their distribution. For
example, a professor, whose time and body are scarce, is paid to share
nonscarce ideas. This is a service, but once the professor’s ideas are
shared, they enter into the realm of all nonscarce goods. What is paid
for in fact is not the idea itself but the presentation, the time
required to share, the labor services of teaching, all of which are
scarce goods.<a href="#fn989" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref989"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>989</sup></a></p>
<p>It is the same with a book or article. What is scarce is the medium
through which the idea is expressed, which is why books, articles, and
web access cost money. The ideas conveyed in them, however, are copyable
without limit.</p>
<p>This is not an insight that applies to digital media alone. This is
true regardless of the technology involved. Whether we are talking about
a scribe working on velum in the 8th century or a writer working on a
web-based document in the 21st century, the ideas conveyed in the words,
and the image of the words themselves, are nonscarce goods, while the
medium through which they are conveyed is scarce. The range and
importance of nonscarce goods has been vastly expanded by the existence
of digital media.</p>
<p>As to whether a good is naturally scarce or nonscarce, the test here
is simple. If the good can be taken (shared) without displacing the
original, it is always nonscarce. If taking the original means that it
can no longer exist in the possession of the original owner or
possessor, it is a scarce good. All goods fall into one or the other
category. All nongoods (unwanted things, necessarily a contingent
category)<a href="#fn990" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref990"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>990</sup></a> can of course be similarly
classified. See Table 1, below.<a href="#fn991" class="footnote-ref"

<h4 id="replication-and-civilization">REPLICATION AND CIVILIZATION</h4>
<p>Nonscarce goods do not need the assistance of prices to ration their
availability. They are free gifts that can be shared the world over. How
important are these goods? Given that they are inclusive of all
information, art, know-how, and anything else that can be possessed and
copied without displacement, they are hugely important. Without these
gifts, the whole of learning, imitation, and world culture would come
crashing down.<a href="#fn992" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref992"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>992</sup></a></p>
<p>We are not truly human without being part of human civilization; and
there can be no civilization and progress without the spread,
dissemination, and accumulation of knowledge. To be human is to be part
of a learning society, a communicating society, an information-sharing
society. Society is emulation-based.</p>
<p>As it stands, the existence of the nonscarce good is the basis of all
intellectual progress, the foundation of technological and artistic
progress, and thereby a boon to civilization. It is also at the core of
enterprise. Entrepreneurs succeed by imitating others who have
succeeded. Their nonscarce experience and ideas are first copied and
then improved, with the goal of profit. The example of success that
entrepreneurs follow is itself a nonscarce good. Anyone with the means
to do so is free to copy the successful idea and replicate it. The
nonscarce good is the fuel of the competitive process.</p>
<p>In contrast, a scarce good cannot be shared without limit. It is
necessarily owned and controlled by only one person at a time; even the
attempt to share implies <em>displacement</em> (while I have it, you do
not). To acquire it requires either homesteading unowned resources or
stealing, transforming, or contractually acquiring (trading for)
already-existing resources.<a href="#fn993" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref993" role="doc-noteref"><sup>993</sup></a> Trading is what
gives rise to rationing and allocating by the price system.</p>
<p>Again, it would be preposterous to speak of socialism in scarce
goods, because it is physically impossible to imagine two simultaneous
owners of the same scarce good.<a href="#fn994" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref994" role="doc-noteref"><sup>994</sup></a> However, it is
possible to speak of something like “socialism” for a good that is
nonscarce by its nature, precisely because it can be infinitely
copied.</p>
<p>The nonscarce good is private so long as it is never revealed; so
long as it remains a secret. Once the secret is out, the good becomes
part of the commons (or socially shared, if you will) because everyone
who encounters it can use it. Technology has worked to create ever more
goods that have become part of the nonscarce category, and this might be
seen as a major feature of technological development for all time.</p>
<h4 id="austrians-on-free-goods">AUSTRIANS ON “FREE GOODS”</h4>
<p>Austrians have always, if sometimes only implicitly, recognized the
existence of the nonscarce good, which is precisely the good in question
with regard to intellectual property. Menger’s 1871 book, <em>Principles
of Economics</em>,<a href="#fn995" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref995"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>995</sup></a> begins with the definition of a
good that excludes the concern over scarcity. Something is a good, in
Menger’s view, when it is causally capable of satisfying a human need.
This is a very broad definition.</p>
<p>Hoppe summarizes Menger’s four requirements for objects to become
goods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first is the existence of a human need. The second requirement is
such properties as render the thing capable of being brought into a
causal connection with a satisfaction of this need. That is, this object
must be capable, through our performing certain manipulations with it,
to cause certain needs to be satisfied or at least relieved. The third
condition is that there must be human knowledge about this connection,
which explains, of course, why it is important for people to learn to
distinguish between <em>goods</em> and <em>bads</em>. Thus, we have
human knowledge about the object, our ability to control it, and the
causal power of this object to lead to certain types of satisfactory
results. And the fourth factor is, as I already indicated, that we must
have command of the thing sufficient to direct it to the satisfaction of
the need.<a href="#fn996" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref996"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>996</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, for Menger, for something to be a good, there must be human
knowledge of this cause-and-effect connection, along with command over
the thing so that the relationship between cause and effect can be
realized. Among these goods he includes goodwill, family connections,
friendship, love, religious and scientific fellowships—all of which fall
into the class of things that can be replicated without displacement.
Only later in the opening chapter, when discussing the issue of
property, does Menger introduce the notion of scarcity and hence the
need for economizing.</p>
<p>Seeing property as a subclass under the larger division of goods
implies the existence of what Ludwig von Mises called a “free
good”—something that is “available in superfluous abundance which man
does not need to economize.”<a href="#fn997" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref997" role="doc-noteref"><sup>997</sup></a> Mises says that
though they are “not the object of any action,” they are useful and even
essential for production.<a href="#fn998" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref998" role="doc-noteref"><sup>998</sup></a> Giving the example
of a recipe, he writes that these free goods, or nonscarce goods, render
“unlimited services.” A free good “does not lose anything from its
capacity to produce however often it is used; its productive power is
inexhaustible; it is therefore not an economic good.”</p>
<p>But it is no less important than normal goods: “These designs—the
recipes, the formulas, the ideologies—are the primary thing; they
transform the original factors—both human and nonhuman—into means.”<a
href="#fn999" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref999"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>999</sup></a> Ideas and information are
nonscarce goods, but they serve as <em>guides to action</em> in the use
of scarce means, to transform scarce things in the world to achieve the
actor’s desired end. As Mises wrote, “Action is purposive conduct. It is
not simply behavior, but behavior begot by judgments of value, aiming at
a definite end and <em>guided by ideas concerning the suitability or
unsuitability of definite means</em>.”<a href="#fn1000"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1000"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1000</sup></a></p>
<p>Murray Rothbard elaborated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is another unique type of factor of production that is
indispensable in every stage of every production process. This is the
“technological idea” of how to proceed from one stage to another and
finally to arrive at the desired consumers’ good. This is but an
application of the analysis above, namely, that for any action, there
must be some <em>plan</em> or idea of the actor about how to use things
as means, as definite pathways, to desired ends. Without such plans or
ideas, there would be no action. These plans may be called
<em>recipes</em>; they are ideas of recipes that the actor uses to
arrive at his goal. A <em>recipe</em> must be present at each stage of
each production process from which the actor proceeds to a later stage.
The actor must have a recipe for transforming iron into steel, wheat
into flour, bread and ham into sandwiches, etc.<a href="#fn1001"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1001"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1001</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Rothbard (and Mises) recognize, once the idea comes about, it no
longer has to be produced or economized. It is an “unlimited factor of
production that never wears out or needs to be economized by human
action.” This is precisely what a nonfinite, nonscarce good is: an
unlimited factor of production.</p>
<p>Fetter also glimpses that ideas themselves are nonscarce goods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gain to the general welfare, however, can result only when the
new inventions are actually embodied in machines. An invention is only
an immaterial idea, and the machines in which inventions are
incorporated are wealth which has a capital value. Further, a gain can
result only when the usance of the machines is not so high as to absorb
the larger part of the gain in efficiency. Not all labor-saving
inventions call for more elaborate or more costly machines. Some are
merely better methods, and require no more equipment—or even less. Some
of them are simpler and less costly than the forms they displace. These
(unless patented) are free goods, uplifting the efficiency of production
“without money and without price.”<a href="#fn1002" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1002" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1002</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Fetter assumes the existence of patent rights and does not
question their legitimacy, he recognizes that methods—which are merely
recipes, a type of information—are nonscarce goods (he calls them “free
goods”) that are freely available and increase efficiency and
productivity—that is, unless they are patented, thus making them
<em>artificially</em> scarce.</p>
<p>One of the longest and most searching essays on this topic is by
Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, in his article “Whether Legal Rights and
Relationships are Economic Goods.”<a href="#fn1003" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1003" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1003</sup></a> In this piece,
Böhm-Bawerk points to several features of things that make them economic
goods, among them physical possession and “the power of disposal and
control.” The notion of scarcity as a precondition for calling something
an “economic good” is presumed but never stated outright. However,
Böhm-Bawerk added critical elements to the idea of the good, noting that
personal services must also be included in this category. Whether such
are truly goods is not inherent in the service itself but depends on the
subjective response to that service, thus introducing to the idea of a
good a subjective component.<a href="#fn1004" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1004" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1004</sup></a> Here Böhm-Bawerk
keenlyobserves the interplay between materially scarce and subjectively
nonscarce goods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be it granted that the poet’s soul must have originated thought and
emotion, and be it further granted that only in another soul and through
intellectual powers can those thoughts and emotions be reproduced, but
the path from soul to soul leads through the physical world for one
stretch of the journey and on that stretch the intellectual element must
make use of the physical vehicle, that is to say, of the forces or
powers of nature. The book is that physical material vehicle.<a
href="#fn1005" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1005"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1005</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Joseph Salerno notes, “Böhm-Bawerk employed the example of the
production and consumption of a poem to illustrate that the good is
inextricably bound up with the want-satisfaction process that traverses
and links the objective and subjective realms.”<a href="#fn1006"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1006"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1006</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="scarce-goods-nonscarce-goods-progress-and-intervention">SCARCE
GOODS, NONSCARCE GOODS, PROGRESS, AND INTERVENTION</h4>
<p>Why does all of this matter? It is interesting on the level of
theory, but it is also critically important as a practical matter.
Enterprise in our time is increasingly dependent on a clear
understanding of the difference between scarce and nonscarce goods. In
the current recession, for example, the bust hit scarce goods, and it is
the scarce-goods sector that the government is attempting to
stimulate.<a href="#fn1007" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1007"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1007</sup></a> But the nonscarce sector, which
is not subject to the structure of production, and therefore is
resistant to business-cycle effects, continues to thrive and has been
unaffected by the machinations of bad macroeconomic policy. (But it is
affected by “intellectual property” regulation, which imposes artificial
scarcity where there is none naturally present.)</p>
<p>Institutions such as Google and the Mises Institute have discovered
the secret of giving away nonscarce goods (search services and digital
books) and restricting commercial operations to allocating only scarce
goods (teacher services, physical books, and advertising space on
screens).<a href="#fn1008" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1008"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1008</sup></a> This combination of giving away
the nonscarce good and selling the scarce good has permitted both
institutions to grow through service.</p>
<p>But this distinction is also exceedingly helpful for understanding
economic theory. It clarifies the absolute necessity of property rights
and free movement of prices for all scarce goods—exactly as classical
economists have said. It also illustrates the need to completely
de-control access to nonscarce goods and to permit the voluntary
learning and sharing process to take its own course.<a href="#fn1009"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1009"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1009</sup></a></p>
<p>Nonscarce goods are a great gift, courtesy of the structure of
reality, a boon to humankind, a vast treasure of resources—tools for
making the world a relentlessly better place.<a href="#fn1010"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1010"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1010</sup></a></p>
<p>The failure to understand the distinction between scarce and
intrinsically nonscarce goods might also help to explain the persistence
of socialist ideology. For example, one possible explanation of the
predictable socialist impulse of religious leaders, intellectuals, and
artists is that their primary work consists in the production and
distribution of nonscarce goods (salvation, ideas, and art) and that
this accounts for the failure of the people in these professions to come
to terms with the relentless reality of scarcity.</p>
<p>In summary, the world has given us two types of goods, one type that
demands allocation through property and prices and one type that can be
infinitely copied. In the production and distribution of scarce goods,
there is no substitute for the commercial marketplace. And the notion
that government should ever restrict replicable nonscarce goods or grant
protection to a single monopolistic producer of nonscarce goods is
contrary to freedom, material advancement, and social peace.</p>

<h4 id="pervasive-social-problems">PERVASIVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS</h4>
<p>Libertarian theorists have made significant contributions to the
fields of economics, politics, and philosophy. Intimately bound up with
libertarian and political theory is the question of what laws and legal
systems are appropriate. Law and legal theory, therefore, have also been
subjected to libertarian scrutiny. One might even say libertarianism is
all about law: which laws are just, which are not. The writing in this
area, however, is usually focused on narrow legal topics, such as
contract or constitutional law.<a href="#fn1011" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1011" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1011</sup></a> Moreover, many
libertarian authors are economists or philosophers who are not
sufficiently familiar with the workings of real legal systems; others
are not completely or consistently libertarian in their approaches.<a
href="#fn1012" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1012"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1012</sup></a> Jurisprudence has yet to receive
the attention it deserves from libertarians (and, one might say:
vice-versa).</p>
<p>The publication of Randy Barnett’s latest book, <em>The Structure of
Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law</em>, helps to fill this lacuna.
Barnett, as a former criminal prosecutor and now law professor at Boston
University School of Law,<a href="#fn1013" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1013" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1013</sup></a> is intimately
familiar with the operation of the American legal system and also with
the arcana of academic jurisprudence. His libertarian credentials are
also impeccable: he has published important libertarian-oriented works
on topics as diverse as contract law, constitutional theory and natural
rights, restitution and criminal law, and drug prohibition.<a
href="#fn1014" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1014"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1014</sup></a> Barnett was thus well-positioned
to write <em>The Structure of Liberty</em>, the first broad and
systematic treatise on legal theory written from a thoroughly
libertarian perspective.</p>
<p>Barnett’s aim in this ambitious book is to determine the type of
legal system, laws, and rights which are appropriate <em>given</em> the
widely-shared “goal of enabling persons to survive and pursue happiness,
peace, and prosperity while living in society with others.”<a
href="#fn1015" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1015"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1015</sup></a> Happiness, peace, and prosperity
are fine principles to select and quite compatible with libertarianism,
but Barnett does not attempt to try to justify these basic norms or
values. His argument is thus hypothetical and consequentialist, though
not, he maintains, utilitarian.<a href="#fn1016" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1016" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1016</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Barnett, the goals of social happiness, peace, and
prosperity cannot be achieved unless society’s politico–legal system
somehow solves certain <em>problems</em> which stand in the way of this
happy state. These are “the serious and pervasive social problems of
knowledge, interest, and power.”<a href="#fn1017" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1017" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1017</sup></a> Libertarianism
enters the picture because the libertarian (Barnett prefers the term
“liberal”) conceptions of <em>justice</em> and the <em>rule of law</em>
provide the “structure of liberty” that addresses these problems. These
principles include the “natural background rights to acquire, possess,
use, and dispose of scarce resources (and other rights as well).”<a
href="#fn1018" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1018"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1018</sup></a> Barnett’s argument thus proceeds
by showing how and why libertarianism is the best way to overcome the
problems of knowledge, interest, and power.<a href="#fn1019"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1019"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1019</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-first-order-problem-of-knowledge">THE FIRST-ORDER PROBLEM OF
KNOWLEDGE</h4>
<p>Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the book respectively describe the three
fundamental problems and how they are solved by libertarian rights and
institutions. Barnett’s first topic, discussed in Part 1, is the problem
of knowledge, which is broken down into separate first-order,
second-order, and third-order aspects.</p>
<p>The first aspect—basically the Hayekian “knowledge problem”<a
href="#fn1020" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1020"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1020</sup></a>—concerns how individuals make
“knowledgeable” use of physical resources.<a href="#fn1021"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1021"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1021</sup></a> This analysis starts out by
presuming that an individual needs to “be able to act on the basis of
[his] own personal knowledge,” and “when so acting [he] must somehow
<em>take into account</em> the knowledge of others.”<a href="#fn1022"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1022"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1022</sup></a></p>
<p>Alas, this is difficult to achieve, because such knowledge is
“dispersed” or “fragmented,” and each individual has “ever-changing and
potentially conflicting personal and local knowledge of potential
resource use.”<a href="#fn1023" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1023"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1023</sup></a> Each person is thus rendered
“hopelessly ignorant” of the “knowledge of others.” So the alleged
problem is this: given the dispersed, often inaccessible, and
potentially “conflicting” nature of such knowledge, how can individuals
act on the basis of their own knowledge while avoiding conflicts over
resource use? And how can they take into account the knowledge of
others?<a href="#fn1024" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1024"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1024</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Barnett, libertarian rights are necessary because they
facilitate the sharing and dissemination of knowledge.<a href="#fn1025"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1025"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1025</sup></a> They include the natural rights
of “several” property (Hayek’s term for private property), Lockean first
possession (homesteading), and freedom of contract.<a href="#fn1026"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1026"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1026</sup></a> If individuals are accorded these
rights, the first-order problem of knowledge is solved. One of the main
ways this happens is that prices arise under such a private-property
order, and prices themselves convey, in “condensed” form, personal and
local knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="knowledge-vs.-calculation"><em>Knowledge
vs. Calculation</em></h4>
<p>There is, unfortunately, much to be desired in Hayek’s emphasis on
the role of knowledge in the economy, as opposed to Ludwig von Mises’s
stress on the more fundamental role of money prices in <em>economic
calculation</em>.<a href="#fn1027" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1027"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1027</sup></a> Hayek’s and Mises’s differing
views have been improperly conflated,<a href="#fn1028"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1028"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1028</sup></a> and Barnett makes the same error
by attributing to Mises Hayek’s views on the information-conveying role
of prices.<a href="#fn1029" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1029"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1029</sup></a></p>
<p>What, then, are the differences between Mises and Hayek on the role
of prices in the economy? Hans-Hermann Hoppe has ably summarized Mises’s
original calculation argument as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is no private property in land and other production factors,
then there can also be no market prices for them. Hence, economic
calculation, i.e., the comparison of anticipated revenue and expected
cost expressed in terms of a common medium of exchange (which permits
<em>cardinal</em> accounting operations), is literally impossible.
Socialism’s fatal error is the absence of private property in land and
production factors, and by implication, the absence of economic
calculation.<a href="#fn1030" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1030"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1030</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theories of Hayek on which Barnett and others have relied,
however, downplay calculation and appraisement in favor of communication
of knowledge. For Hayek, as Hülsmann notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the impossibility of socialism stems from its inability to
<em>communicate dispersed knowledge</em>…. [I]nformation about the
particular circumstancesof time and place can never be centralized. It
necessarily exists in dispersed form and yet it can be communicated by
the market prices of capitalist societies. Only capitalism is thus
capable of solving the knowledge problem.<a href="#fn1031"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1031"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1031</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But any informational function of prices is, at best, only secondary
in comparison to the primary role of private property and money prices.
The fundamental economic role of private property, along with money
prices arising from exchanges of such property, as Mises showed, is to
permit <em>economic calculation</em>. And, socially speaking,
private-property rights serve to prevent conflict over resources.
<em>This</em> is why private-property rights serve Barnett’s goals of
peace and prosperity: private property rights permit conflicts to be
avoided (peace) and allow genuine, free-market money prices to form
which can be used for economic calculation and hence rational resource
allocation (prosperity). Concentration on the information-conveying role
of prices instead of calculation obscures this role.<a href="#fn1032"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1032"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1032</sup></a> For example, Hayekians claim that
prices “contain” economic information in “condensed” (or encrypted,
encoded, or abridged) form.<a href="#fn1033" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1033" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1033</sup></a> Barnett follows
the Hayekians when he states that “the knowledge-disseminating function
of prices is largely unknown … the knowledge embedded in prices is not
explicit…. It is encoded knowledge.”<a href="#fn1034"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1034"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1034</sup></a></p>
<p>There are several problems with viewing prices as encoding
information. For one thing, concepts such as encoding, encryption, and
the like <em>imply an encoder</em>—a person who actively and consciously
<em>encodes</em> information in some communication medium, in accordance
with some encoding scheme (i.e., the code). Yet there is clearly no
intentional encoding of whatever knowledge may be embedded in prices;
there is no encoding scheme and no way to decode the information. I buy
a car for $30,000 because I think it is worth it, not to convey some
secret message to someone.<a href="#fn1035" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1035" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1035</sup></a> Knowledge that I
paid this price for the car does not reveal any information about the
underlying objective conditions that give rise to this price (e.g., the
intensity of my demand or the relative scarcity of the car). Such
knowledge reveals only that I valued the car more than $30,000, and the
seller had the opposite valuation.</p>
<p>Prices result from the subjective evaluations of goods by seller and
buyer, but prices <em>are</em> exchange ratios. Besides these ratios,
what other information <em>could</em> money prices communicate? What
information can a mere price ratio convey? Take Hayek’s famous tin
example, which assumes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of some
raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of supply
of tin has been eliminated. <em>It does not matter</em> for our
purpose—and it is significant that it does not matter—<em>which</em> of
these two causes has made tin more scarce. All that the users of tin
need to know is that some of the tin they used to consume is now more
profitably employed elsewhere and that, in consequence, they must
economize tin. There is no need for the great majority of them even to
know where the more urgent need has arisen, or in favor of what other
needs they ought to husband the supply. If only some of them know
directly of the new demand, and switch resources over to it, and if the
people who are aware of the new gap thus created in turn fill it from
still other sources, the effect will rapidly spread throughout the whole
economic system and influence not only all the uses of tin but also
those of its substitutes and the substitutes of these substitutes, the
supply of all the things made of tin, and their substitutes, and so on;
and all this without the great majority of those instrumental in
bringing about these substitutions <em>knowing anything at all about the
original cause of these changes.</em><a href="#fn1036"

</blockquote>
<p>In this example, what information, <em>exactly</em>, is supposed to
be conveyed by prices? Let us explore the possibilities. Can the
original <em>cause</em> of the price increase (i.e., the change in
demand or supply) itself be conveyed via prices? Well, no. Prices are
the <em>result</em> of action. Thus, action that changes the prices must
<em>already be informed by</em> knowledge.<a href="#fn1037"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1037"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1037</sup></a> Entrepreneurs <em>first</em> see
the changed conditions and <em>then</em> bid prices up or down. They do
not learn about the changed conditions <em>from</em> the resulting
prices. Rather, they <em>cause</em> the prices to change, <em>based
on</em> their appraisement of tin and knowledge or judgment of
underlying conditions. Hayek seems to recognize that those entrepreneurs
who “know directly of the new demand, and switch resources over to it”
do not learn from prices, but rather help to form prices based on their
own preferences, knowledge, evaluations, and judgments.</p>
<p>What about users of tin who merely observe the change in prices paid
for tin—do these persons learn anything, from observed past prices,
about the underlying conditions or “original cause” of the change in
prices? No, because any of a variety of causes results in higher or
lower prices (e.g., changes in demand by buyers or sellers, decrease in
supply, changes in demand for money on the part of sellers or buyers,
etc.). For these reasons, Hayek says that mere users of tin do not know
“anything at all about the original cause of these changes.”</p>
<p>Then what possible information can prices convey? Hayek writes: “All
that the users of tin <em>need to know</em> is that some of the tin they
used to consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in
consequence, they must economize tin.”<a href="#fn1038"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1038"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1038</sup></a> But the users do not
<em>need</em> to know this; if tin is scarcer, there is less of it to go
around.<a href="#fn1039" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1039"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1039</sup></a> Whether the prospective users
know of the increased scarcity or not, they cannot use what does not
exist. Their plans will have to conform, sooner or later, to this
increased unavailability of tin.</p>
<p>At most, one could argue that the existence of prices enables
prospective users to recognize the good’s relative scarcity somewhat
earlier than they would in the absence of prices (that is, sooner rather
than later). And even this cannot be stated to be true as an economic
law, simply because <em>all</em> prices are <em>speculative</em> and
based on entrepreneurial judgments and anticipations about future
(uncertain) conditions. An entrepreneur, for example, may bid the price
of a good up based on a <em>mistaken</em> judgment about relevant future
conditions, such as supply and demand. What do prices then convey in
such a case—misinformation?</p>
<p>In any event, even granting that observers can learn of relative
scarcity of a good from prices, emphasis on this aspect of prices
distracts from the crucial role that prices play in economic
calculation. That is, even if prices do tend to help users to become
aware of a good’s relative scarcity somewhat earlier than they would
otherwise, it is not this function of prices which addresses the
insurmountable problems of production and human action that are faced in
the absence of private property. The fundamental problem faced by acting
man is not the fact that information is dispersed.<a href="#fn1040"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1040"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1040</sup></a> Rather, it is deciding how to
rationally allocate resources in the face of an uncertain future and
given the subjective nature of value, which makes it impossible to
compare alternative projects or plans in the absence of a cardinal set
of prices.</p>
<p>Thus, as Rothbard explains, “what acting man is interested in, in
committing resources into production and sale, is <em>future</em>
prices.”<a href="#fn1041" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1041"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1041</sup></a> The primary role of prices in a
productive, advanced economy is not to communicate information, but to
serve as the <em>starting point</em> for estimating what <em>future</em>
prices will be.<a href="#fn1042" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1042"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1042</sup></a> The forecasted future prices are
then used to quantitatively compare various projects and to select the
most profitable—and thus most value-productive—use of resources under
consideration.<a href="#fn1043" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1043"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1043</sup></a> Prices are thus important because
they serve as an <em>accessory of appraisement</em>. “Current”
(immediate past) prices tell only what the current price structure is,
and thus serve as a basis for forecasting what the future array of
prices will be, given the current starting point. Thus, present prices
“can have no communicative function because they are only the, if
indispensable, starting point for our understanding of the future.”<a

<p>The problem faced in a society without libertarian property rules is
that there can be no money prices and there can thus be no economic
calculation. Talk of a knowledge-disseminating role for prices is flawed
and misses the point. Accordingly, Hoppe concludes that “Hayek’s
contribution to the socialism debate must be thrown out as false,
confusing, and irrelevant.”<a href="#fn1045" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1045" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1045</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="barnett-on-knowledge"><em>Barnett on Knowledge</em></h4>
<p>Barnett’s attempt to make knowledge the central inquiry, instead of
calculation, scarcity, and interpersonal conflict, leads, not
surprisingly, to confusion. Barnett maintains that the problem to be
solved is “potentially conflicting personal and local knowledge of
potential resource use”<a href="#fn1046" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1046" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1046</sup></a> or conflicting
“preferences.”<a href="#fn1047" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1047"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1047</sup></a> He then claims that private
property and related liberal rules would minimize such conflicts,
because it would lead to <em>you</em> “taking into account” <em>my</em>
information and vice-versa, and to a general spreading of information
(in “encoded” form).</p>
<p>As an example, Barnett hypothesizes that “there is a particular tree
between my neighbor’s house and mine.”<a href="#fn1048"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1048"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1048</sup></a> One neighbor wants to keep the
tree; yet the other wants to cut it down because it blocks his view of
the sunset. Although Barnett acknowledges that it is these proposed
<em>actions</em> (keeping the tree; cutting it down) which conflict with
each other, he awkwardly and unnecessarily tries to fit this within the
knowledge framework. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my example, my neighbor and I both have personal knowledge of how
the tree affects the view from our respective windows. My neighbor and I
have personal knowledge of each of our preferences concerning the use of
this particular tree. Finally, and most significantly, these preferences
conflict or, more precisely, each of us subjectively prefers to use the
tree in physically incompatible ways…. Notice that there is no problem
of scarcity in the absence of an incompatibility of subjective
preferences.<a href="#fn1049" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1049"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1049</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now assigning property rights to the tree, as Barnett advocates, does
solve the problem of conflict over use of the tree: Whichever neighbor
owns the tree gets to decide whether to cut it down or not. But this
solution has nothing to do with knowledge—except to the extent that
non-owners must of course <em>know</em> someone else <em>owns</em> the
tree in order to avoid conflicts over use of the tree.<a href="#fn1050"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1050"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1050</sup></a> The true way to avoid conflict is
to establish, and promote respect for, property rights, not to
disseminate “local” knowledge or information about others’
preferences.</p>
<p>Barnett’s account implicitly recognizes this. He says, for
example,that the “radical dispersion of knowledge … leads to a knowledge
problem when people seek to act on the basis of their differing
knowledge in incompatible ways.”<a href="#fn1051" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1051" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1051</sup></a> Note that the
phrase “on the basis of their differing knowledge” is completely
superfluous here; if it is eliminated, then this says that a problem
arises “when people seek to act—<em>in incompatible ways</em>”—that is,
when there are conflicting <em>actions</em> in the <em>use</em> of
scarce resources. But conflicts are not caused by lack of knowledge, and
thus cannot be solved by the spreading of knowledge. Conflicts arise
because of the fundamental fact of scarcity and the lack of property
rights allocating control of resources to specified owners.<a
href="#fn1052" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1052"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1052</sup></a> That is why property rights are
the only way to prevent conflicts over scarce resources.</p>
<p>Why would anyone think knowledge <em>could</em> prevent conflict?
Even omniscient actors, who are fully aware of each other’s preferences
and intentions, may struggle for control of a given scarce resource. If
lack of knowledge is the reason for conflict over the tree in Barnett’s
tree example, surely the two neighbors would be able to learn of each
other’s conflicting preferences—by speaking with or watching each
other—more easily than they learn similar facts in “condensed” form from
the general price system! How will prices tell owners who <em>owns</em>
the tree, i.e., who may control it? In fact, the existence of prices
<em>presupposes</em> a system of private property, which itself
<em>already</em> resolves conflicts over the use of scarce resources. As
Hoppe puts it, “[p]rivate property is the necessary condition—<em>die
Bedingung der Möglichkeit</em>—of the knowledge communicated through
prices.”<a href="#fn1053" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1053"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1053</sup></a> In any private-property system,
whether or not prices have yet arisen, the private-property rules
themselves suffice to promote peace and cooperation.</p>
<p>And a deeper difficulty looms in Barnett’s account. For how can
knowledge, or even preferences, of two individuals “conflict”? If we use
the term “preference” in the precisely defined meaning it has in
praxeology, where it concerns only one’s demonstrably preferred use of
one’s own property,<a href="#fn1054" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1054"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1054</sup></a> there <em>can</em> be no conflict
in preferences. The non-owner simply cannot have demonstrated
preferences with regard to his neighbor’s property, because these
preferences would have to be demonstrated in action with another’s
property, which is prohibited. And if, instead, Barnett means only to
use “preferences” in some colloquial, imprecise sense, how can
information prevent conflicting preferences? In this loose sense of
preference, individuals can have different preferences, even if they are
“aware” of the other’s wants. And such a casual conception of preference
cannot hope to be used to establish a rigorous case for private
property, anyway.</p>
<p>Libertarians (and Misesian–Austrians) recognize that it is only
<em>actions</em> that can conflict; it is the very possibility of
conflict over the use of things that renders these things
<em>scarce</em> resources and thus possible economic goods. Again, when
the rubber hits the road, Barnett recognizes this truth: he notes that
“there would be no knowledge <em>problem</em> with respect to resource
use in the absence of scarcity.”<a href="#fn1055" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1055" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1055</sup></a> He also notes
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>actions</em> of some, not their preferences, are what
interfere with the ability of others to pursue happiness by acting on
the basis of their own personal and local knowledge. What is sought is a
social order in which such knowledgeable actions by everyone are
possible.<a href="#fn1056" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1056"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1056</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, when he actually has to formulate operational rules for guiding
conduct, Barnett appropriately focuses on conflicting <em>actions</em>
directed at scarce resources and shows that property rights are
necessary to prevent such conflicts. Talk about knowledge and preference
conflicts, and about the need for “knowledgeable actions” (instead of
successful action), is superfluous and distracting window dressing.</p>
<p>Instead of the misplaced emphasis on knowledge, Barnett could have
more straightforwardly noted that there indeed is a problematic
potential for interpersonal conflict over scarce resources (including
one’s body), which would interfere with his assumed goals of peace and
happiness. He could then have argued that private-property rights and
the libertarian principles of self-ownership and Lockean homesteading
solve this problem of interpersonal conflict.<a href="#fn1057"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1057"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1057</sup></a> Libertarian homesteading and
property rules give rise to peace and prosperity, because in such a
system conflicts can be avoided and prices can arise to allow economic
calculation and thus rational resource allocation.</p>
<p>In fact, this more direct approach could have led Barnett to
recognize that it is possible to give much more than a merely
hypothetical or consequentialist defense of libertarian principles by
using Hoppe’s pathbreaking argument that advocacy of any social ethic
other than private property <em>contradicts</em> peace- and
happiness-conducive norms such as cooperation and conflict-avoidance,
which are necessarily presupposed by all participants in
argumentation.<a href="#fn1058" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1058"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1058</sup></a> In fact, in other writings
Barnett argues, in a way compatible in approach with Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics, that those who claim that the U.S. Constitution
justifies certain government regulation of individuals are themselves
introducing normative claims into discourse and thus cannot object, on
positivist or <em>wertfrei</em> grounds, to a moral or normative
criticism of their position.<a href="#fn1059" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1059" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1059</sup></a></p>
<p>What about the goal of prosperity? Here Barnett could have pointed
out, following Mises, that the private-property order and its
accompanying price system also permits economic calculation and thus is
the only way to achieve this goal. “Knowledge” would have been
recognized as merely a technical problem that confronts any individual
when choosing means to achieve certain ends and when deciding which ends
to pursue.<a href="#fn1060" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1060"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1060</sup></a></p>
<p>As for the right to contract (contractually transfer resources to
others),Barnett provides a Byzantine argument that such a contract-based
system is desirable because it requires the buyer to take the current
owner’s knowledge “into account.”<a href="#fn1061" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1061" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1061</sup></a> Barnett also
favors freedom of contract because it allows a price system to emerge,
which serves as a powerful engine for the encoding and transmission of
knowledge. Again, knowledge need not be even mentioned to support the
institution of contracting. First, Barnett has already argued that the
rights to homestead and use property are necessary to solve conflicts
and promote prosperity. But the right to contract is implicit in the
rights to acquire and use property. This is because if one has the right
to acquire property, one has the right to abandon it (i.e., one has to
be permitted to get rid of it, e.g., give it to another). And if one has
the right to use property, this implies that others cannot take the
property without obtaining the owner’s consent.</p>
<p>Second, as Barnett notes, the right to exchange titles to property
allows a price system to arise. Yet as already noted, the price system
promotes Barnett’s goal of prosperity not because of knowledge
dissemination but because of the crucial role of prices as accessories
of appraisement. Third, permitting contractual transfer of resources
promotes prosperity because both parties to a voluntary exchange are
made better off.<a href="#fn1062" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1062"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1062</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, it is the potential for interpersonal conflict and lack of
objectively and justly defined property rights that endangers liberty,
peace, and prosperity, not ignorance of others’ preferences and local
knowledge. Barnett’s various “knowledge problems” are therefore better
reformulated as “conflict problems.” Libertarian principles would then
be seen as ways to promote harmony and prosperity and to avoid conflict,
instead of remedying the non-problem of deficiencies in knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="the-second-order-problem-of-knowledge-and-the-rule-of-law">THE
SECOND-ORDER PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE RULE OF LAW</h4>
<p>“The <em>second-order problem of knowledge</em> is the need to
communicate knowledge of justice in a manner that makes the actions it
requires accessible to everyone.”<a href="#fn1063" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1063" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1063</sup></a> This is where the
rule of law comes in. The rules of justice (i.e., substantive laws
concerning private-property rights, etc.) must be adequately
<em>communicated</em> to individuals so that they can serve as guides to
action and thus prevent conflicts. To ensure adequate communication,
various “formal” requirements must be satisfied. These formal
requirements—the rule of law—govern both the <em>form</em> of laws and
<em>processes</em> by which they are generated and promulgated.<a
href="#fn1064" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1064"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1064</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, rules of conduct must be communicated ahead of time
(<em>ex ante</em>); and they must also be sufficiently concrete to be
applied in a variety of situations. These and other considerations lead
to the conclusion that laws must be: “(a) general rules or principles
that are (b) publicized, (c) prospective in effect, (d) understandable,
(e) compossible, (f) possible to follow, (<em>g</em>) stable, and (h)
enforced as publicized.”<a href="#fn1065" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1065" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1065</sup></a> Otherwise, a rule
cannot serve as an operational guide to conduct or will not be just.</p>
<h4 id="abstract-rights-and-legal-precepts"><em>Abstract Rights and
Legal Precepts</em></h4>
<p>As Barnett insightfully explains, principles such as private
property, first possession, and freedom of contract are very
<em>abstract</em>, and thus cannot serve to guide conduct except in
relatively rare situations.<a href="#fn1066" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1066" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1066</sup></a> (Barnett refers to
such abstract natural rights as “background” rights, as opposed to the
actually existing or enforced laws or rights, which he refers to as
legal rights. It is background rights to which legal rights
<em>should</em> conform.)<a href="#fn1067" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1067" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1067</sup></a> Thus, any legal
system must develop a body of specific or concrete legal rules or
principles, based on or at least compatible with more abstract
background rights. Barnett refers to the particular, concrete rules or
principles that serve as guides to action as <em>legal precepts</em>.<a
href="#fn1068" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1068"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1068</sup></a></p>
<p>This analysis is on the mark, because it is true that legal
principles must be known (communicated or published) and
<em>operational</em> (sufficiently concrete) if they are to be used to
avoid conflicts. The common tie between Barnett’s second-order and
first-order problems is therefore not <em>knowledge</em> but rather
<em>conflict-avoidance</em>. A private-property order helps to avoid
conflicts because each scarce resource is assigned a specified proper
owner (reformulated first-order analysis). For conflicts to actually be
avoided by individuals respecting these rules, however, the various
rules as well as actual property boundaries must of course be
<em>known</em>: I cannot consciously avoid trespassing on your property
unless<br />
I know it is property and that trespassing is impermissible.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, this requires the rule of law be followed and
that legal rules be concrete enough (Barnett’s legal precepts) to serve
as operational guides to action. This problem is in a sense inherent in
the very idea of a private-property order, because the latter cannot
exist if no one <em>knows</em> what conflict-avoidance rules to follow,
but it is a real problem nonetheless and deserves the attention Barnett
gives it.</p>
<h4 id="the-third-order-problem-of-knowledge-and-the-common-law">THE
THIRD-ORDER PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE COMMON LAW</h4>
<p>What kind of legal and political system guarantees (or at least makes
it possible) that the rule of law will be followed? How will concrete
legal precepts be developed? (Barnett does not ask how the abstract
natural or background rights are to be developed; presumably through the
writings of academic specialists like Barnett.) Clearly, some
institutional means of providing such concrete private-property rules is
needed. This is where a decentralized law-generation process such as the
common law steps in.</p>
<p>In chapter 6, Barnett expands the conception of the rule of law to
include the way in which a body of legal precepts is developed.
According to Barnett, the “<em>third-order problem of knowledge</em> is
the need to determine specific action-guiding precepts that are
consistent with both the requirements of justice and the rule of law.”<a
href="#fn1069" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1069"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1069</sup></a> Again, I would characterize this
as related to conflict-avoidance rather than knowledge. In order to
avoid conflicts, concrete private-property rules must be developed by
some institution, and the institution must be such that the rules
developed are just.<a href="#fn1070" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1070"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1070</sup></a></p>
<p>Barnett first maintains that there are limits to the ability to
deduce specific legal precepts from abstract principles of justice
(natural rights), in part because many sets of legal precepts are
consistent with the general parameters of the abstract principles of
natural rights.<a href="#fn1071" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1071"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1071</sup></a> He argues that a common-law type
decentralized legal system, unlike law professors and philosophers, can
develop legal precepts, because, in such a system, they gradually
develop and evolve from the outcomes of thousands of actual cases.</p>
<p>Yet, Barnett does not provide a rigorous argument showing where the
exact <em>limits</em> of the ability to deduce concrete rules are. He
evidently feels that the more abstract principles can, for some reason,
be established by armchair theorists. If denizens of the ivory tower can
do this, why can they not deduce or establish more concrete rules by
simply considering more and more contextual facts?<a href="#fn1072"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1072"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1072</sup></a> In the Roman law system—a
somewhat decentralized legal system superior in many ways to the common
law—Roman jurists (jurisconsults) helped develop the great body of Roman
law by providing opinions on the best way to resolve disputes. These
disputes were often purely hypothetical or imaginary cases, in which the
jurists asked, “Under such and such a possible or conceivable
combination of circumstances, what would the law require?”<a
href="#fn1073" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1073"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1073</sup></a> It is conceivable that a large
part or even all of the legal code existing in a given society can be
“deduced” in this fashion and then these rules applied like precedents
to actual controversies as they arise. As a libertarian (and, I confess,
a lawyer), I must say that I believe I would be more comfortable living
under a set of concrete rules deduced by libertarian philosophers than
the (perhaps more concrete) set of rules developed under the actual
common law, although, as noted, there are limits to armchair
theorizing.</p>
<p>Still, Barnett’s argument in favor of a common-law system makes
sense, even to libertarians who favor a deductive approach to rights.<a
href="#fn1074" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1074"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1074</sup></a> Legal rules must be concrete in
the sense that the rules must take into account the entire relevant
factual context. Since there are an infinite number of factual
situations that could exist in interactions between individuals, a
process which focuses on actual cases or controversies is likely to
produce the most “interesting” or useful rules.<a href="#fn1075"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1075"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1075</sup></a> It probably makes little sense
devoting scarce time and resources to developing legal precepts for
imaginary or unrealistic scenarios. If nothing else, a common-law type
system that develops and refines legal precepts as new cases arise
serves as a sort of filter that selects which disputes (i.e., real,
commonly-encountered ones) to devote attention to.</p>
<p>Barnett thus makes a convincing case that, in a decentralized legal
system such as the English common law (or the early Roman law, the Law
Merchant, and even modern arbitral systems)—especially one in which
judges or arbitrators attempt to apply fundamental notions of justice to
concrete situations—it is reasonable to expect a body of concrete legal
concepts and precepts to develop which are more or less compatible with
fundamental notions of justice.<a href="#fn1076" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1076" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1076</sup></a></p>
<p>If and when unjust legal precepts do arise, they are not necessarily
permanent, because a common-law process allows them to be modified or
replaced when this becomes apparent. However, unless it is clear that a
given legal precept is inconsistent with justice, then there should be
reluctance to jettison established legal rules or precedents. This thus
gives rise to the legal doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> (or
<em>jurisprudence constante</em> in continental or civil-law systems).<a
href="#fn1077" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1077"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1077</sup></a></p>
<p>This leads Barnett to make the provocative (for libertarians)
argument that the “legal rights generated by a sound legal process may
even be entitled to <em>presumptive legitimacy</em>”<a href="#fn1078"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1078"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1078</sup></a> and thus can even assist in
determining the content of our background rights. We can always subject
concrete legal precepts developed by courts to the scrutiny of the more
abstract principles of justice and natural rights. This can help
identify legal precepts “that are … inconsistent with either justice or
the rule of law or both.”<a href="#fn1079" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1079" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1079</sup></a></p>
<p>One question that bears exploring in this regard is exactly <em>how
libertarian</em> are the abstract principles of justice that have been
followed throughout the ages by judges and jurists of the common law,
Roman law, and Law Merchant? In other words, just how libertarian are
the legal precepts actually developed historically, and just how strong
is the presumption of legitimacy which is to be accorded to these extant
bodies of law? Which concepts of the common law are illiberal enough,
when compared to Barnett’s carefully-developed abstract principles of
justice, to overcome the presumption of legitimacy? And how did the
common law happen to employ more or less correct abstract principles of
justice even before modern libertarian theory? Are these principles
intuitive? Was it luck? Natural selection? Barnett does not answer these
questions, but cannot be criticized for not doing everything.<a

<h4 id="problems-of-interest-and-power">PROBLEMS OF INTEREST AND
POWER</h4>
<p>After discussing the problems of knowledge (better characterized as
conflict-avoidance, as noted above), Barnett turns to problems of
<em>interest</em> and <em>power</em>. The problems of interest concern
how individuals balance questions of incentive, compliance, and
partiality in access to resources. The problems of power are the
possibility that there will be error and abuse in applying or enforcing
legal precepts. Barnett elaborates on these challenges, and shows how
each of them is addressed by the libertarian conception of justice and
the rule of law.</p>
<p>Most of Barnett’s arguments concerning interest and power are more
straightforward than those regarding knowledge in Part 1, even where
Barnett tries to support his arguments by referring to various
knowledge-related aspects of the issue at hand. Barnett’s discussion of
the “problem of partiality,” however (the first problem of interest),
seems overly muddled due to the preoccupation with knowledge. Barnett
claims that there is a “partiality problem” which “arises from the fact
that people tend to make judgments that are partial to their own
interests or the interests of those who are close to them at the expense
of others.”<a href="#fn1081" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1081"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1081</sup></a> This partiality “leads to a
tendency to favor ones own interest”; partiality “is judgment affected
by interest.” Maybe I am slow, but I cannot see what is the alleged
problem here. This seems to be nothing more than the unavoidable fact of
self-interest. Of course people are “partial” to themselves. What is
wrong with this? I see no need for people to take “into account the
partial interests of others.”<a href="#fn1082" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1082" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1082</sup></a> So long as others’
property rights are respected, it seems to me that one ought to be able
to be as “partial” as one likes without others complaining about it.</p>
<p>Barnett’s discussion of the other problems of interest and the
problems of power, though, are much more fruitful and less tainted by
the occasional and vain attempt to link it to the Hayekian knowledge
paradigm. For example, it is certainly true that the incentives which
are provided under capitalism are very useful and are missing under
socialism.<a href="#fn1083" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1083"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1083</sup></a> And there is indeed a need to
ensure <em>compliance</em> <a href="#fn1084" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1084" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1084</sup></a> with
private-property rules, e.g., by using force for self-defense,
restitution, and punishment.<a href="#fn1085" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1085" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1085</sup></a> I see no strong
reason to call these problems of “interest,” although the label seems
harmless enough.</p>
<p>And (Part 3), there are indeed dangers involved in the use of power,
such as the possibility of <em>error</em> in enforcement and
punishment<a href="#fn1086" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1086"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1086</sup></a> and abuse of the power of law
enforcement.<a href="#fn1087" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1087"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1087</sup></a> Many of Barnett’s arguments here
are very insightful and persuasive (some discussed below), although
again, I find most of them to be so <em>despite</em> the superfluous
comments on knowledge. In fact, I found the last half of the book,<a
href="#fn1088" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1088"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1088</sup></a> which bears less and less on the
knowledge paradigm introduced at the beginning, to be the most
fascinating and best part of the book (plus the discussion of the common
law in chapter 6).</p>
<h4 id="restitution-vs.-retribution"><em>Restitution
vs. Retribution</em></h4>
<p>One interesting argument that Barnett makes, with regard to
enforcement error and abuse, is that all criminal justice should be
restitutive, not punitive or retributive. As I have argued elsewhere,<a
href="#fn1089" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1089"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1089</sup></a> I believe Barnett is mistaken
that retribution (punishment) violates the <em>rights</em> of (actually
guilty) aggressors.<a href="#fn1090" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1090"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1090</sup></a> However, in keeping with his
consequentialist approach, which avoids questions of justification of
fundamental norms, Barnett does not pretend to make a strong theoretical
case for the rights of aggressors to be free from punishment.<a
href="#fn1091" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1091"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1091</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, most of Barnett’s concerns regarding punishment are
warranted: he opposes it because he believes it may deter crime less
than would a restitution-based system and also because the unavoidable
possibility of error can lead to “infliction of harm on the
<em>innocent</em>.”<a href="#fn1092" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1092"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1092</sup></a> Like Barnett, I am concerned
about the unavoidable possibility of mistakenly punishing the innocent,
and thus admit the appeal of a restitution-based system in order to
avoid punishing innocents. Moreover, Barnett makes a powerful and
original argument for why the <em>standard of proof</em> should be
higher if a victim seeks to punish a purported aggressor rather than
merely obtain restitution.<a href="#fn1093" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1093" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1093</sup></a> Thus, a victim
seeking to punish the aggressor must prove guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt, whereas the lower standard of preponderance of the evidence is
more appropriate for a civil trial for damages. It is therefore <em>more
costly</em> to seek punishment than to seek restitution. For this and
other reasons, restitution would probably become the predominant mode of
justice in a free society.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, acknowledging (and justifying) the theoretical
legitimacy of punishment can be useful. For example, punishment (or a
theory of punishment) may be utilized to reach a more objective
determination of the proper amount of restitution,<a href="#fn1094"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1094"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1094</sup></a> because a serious aggression
leads to the right to inflict more severe punishment on the aggressor,
which would thus tend to be traded for a higher average amount of ransom
or restitution than for comparatively minor crimes.<a href="#fn1095"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1095"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1095</sup></a> Especially offended victims will
tend to bargain for a higher ransom; and richer aggressors will tend to
be willing to pay more ransom to avoid the punishment the victim has a
right to inflict, thereby solving the so-called “millionaire” problem
faced under a pure restitution system (where a rich man may commit
crimes with impunity, since he can simply pay easily-affordable
restitution after committing the crime).</p>
<p>Moreover, even if punishment is banned (<em>de facto</em> or <em>de
jure</em>) and is not an actual option—because of the possibility of
mistakenly punishing innocents, say—an award of restitution can be
<em>based on</em> the model of punishment. To-wit: a jury could be
instructed to award the victim an amount of money it believes he
<em>could</em> bargain for, given all the circumstances, <em>if</em> he
could threaten to proportionately punish the aggressor. This can lead to
more just and objective restitution awards than would result if the jury
is simply told to award the amount of damages it “feels” is “fair.”
Barnett nowhere specifies any objective standards or criteria by which a
judge or jury is to determine the amount of restitution a victim is to
receive for a non-economic crime like murder, rape, and the like. He
specifies only that the aggressor must “compensate” the victim for the
“harm caused,” to “restore” the victim.<a href="#fn1096"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1096"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1096</sup></a> Thus, a retribution-based system,
even if used only as a model to help determine the amount or standard of
restitutive damages, supplements Barnett’s theory of a restitution-based
justice system.</p>
<h4 id="preventative-force"><em>Preventative Force</em></h4>
<p>Barnett makes a convincing case that the principle of “extended
self-defense” justifies imprisoning (sometimes for life) those who have
made a sufficiently unambiguous communication of a threat to another.<a
href="#fn1097" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1097"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1097</sup></a> Because of the possibility of
enforcement abuse and rule of law considerations, however, Barnett would
limit this remedy to those persons who have communicated a threat to
others by their past criminal behavior (i.e., those who have been
convicted, perhaps multiple times, of a crime), and only if the previous
crimes were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<a href="#fn1098"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1098"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1098</sup></a></p>
<p>This limitation on the principle of extended self-defense seems to me
to be unduly restrictive, however. In my view, a threat can be viewed as
a species of the crime of <em>assault</em>. Assault is defined as
putting someone in fear of receiving a battery (physical beating).<a
href="#fn1099" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1099"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1099</sup></a> A threat should count as a type
of assault because the threatener puts the victim in fear of receiving a
battery and also deliberately increases the likelihood of physical harm
befalling the victim. As explained elsewhere,<a href="#fn1100"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1100"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1100</sup></a> assault may be punished because
this is the only way the victim can reciprocate and put the
aggressor–threatener in a like state of fear. I see no reason to allow
extended self-defense only where the aggressor has previously been
convicted of a crime. Even the first crime is a crime.</p>
<h4 id="polycentrismi-mean-anarcho-capitalism">POLYCENTRISM—I MEAN,
ANARCHO-CAPITALISM</h4>
<p>One of the best parts of <em>The Structure of Liberty</em> is its
argument in favor of anarcho-capitalism. It is marred by its strict
avoidance of the more appropriate terms anarcho-capitalism or anarchy;
Barnett for some reason prefers to describe anarcho-capitalism as a
“polycentric constitutional order,” presumably to avoid unduly
alienating statist readers. (If he feels polycentric is a better term
than anarcho-capitalism, he does not offer reasons.)</p>
<p>Barnett notes that various types of structures have been tried “to
deal with the problem of enforcement abuse by a coercive monopoly of
power,” i.e., government, including elections, federalism, and free
emigration. Yet, he recognizes, these have failed to keep government in
check. Thus, he argues that each of these three principles “reflects a
more fundamental principle that needs to be more robustly incorporated
into institutional arrangements: <em>reciprocity, checks and
balances</em>, and the <em>power of exit</em>.” <a href="#fn1101"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1101"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1101</sup></a></p>
<p>Barnett elaborates on these in chapter 13, one of the best in the
book. He notes that two constitutional principles are sufficient to
achieve a polycentric order: <em>nonconfiscation</em> and
<em>competition</em>. Under the former, “[l]aw-enforcement and
adjudicative agencies should not be able to confiscate their income by
force, but should have to contract with the persons they serve.” Under
the latter, they “should not be able to put their competitors out of
business by force.”<a href="#fn1102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1102"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1102</sup></a> As is clear to libertarians,
adherence to these two principles would indeed result in the
anarcho-capitalist society, for no government can exist without the
ability of a coercive monopoly over its services.<a href="#fn1103"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1103"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1103</sup></a></p>
<p>Barnett makes several excellent points in chapter 13. He notes, for
example, that if an individual refuses to contract with any legal
system, force can still be used against him if he harms others. “The
justice of using force against such a person is based on the fact that
he or she violated the rights of the victim, not that he or she
consented to the jurisdiction of a court.”<a href="#fn1104"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1104"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1104</sup></a> It is refreshing to see this
point emphasized, because many advocates of anarcho-capitalism seem to
feel that an aggressor can be punished by a defense agency only if the
aggressor somehow previously consented to the jurisdiction of the agency
(if he did not consent, the only permissible remedy is presumably
ostracism).</p>
<p>Another excellent point concerns the likelihood of a polycentric
order actually embodying liberal norms. Barnett sensibly points out
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it is difficult to imagine a society that did not adhere to some
version of a liberal conception of justice ever accepting a polycentric
constitutional order in the first instance. A societal consensus
supporting these rights and remedies would seem to be a precondition for
ever peacefully ending [monopoly government power]. And, once adopted,
the inherent stability of the robust “checks and balances” provided by a
competitive system is likely to preserve this initial consensus.<a
href="#fn1105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1105"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1105</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, my favorite part of the book is the well-written,
thoughtful, and imaginative chapter 14, “Imagining a Polycentric
Constitutional Order: A Short Fable,” in which Barnett speculates on
what a possible polycentric-ordered society might look like and how it
might function. I mean, an anarcho-capitalist society.</p>
<h4 id="terminology">TERMINOLOGY</h4>
<p>It is clear that Barnett is a libertarian and that <em>The Structure
of Liberty</em> is thoroughly infused with libertarian principles with
regard to rights, government, and economics. He even goes so far as to
advocate a polycentric—i.e., anarcho-capitalist—system. But one
irritating aspect of the book is the unconventional and idiosyncratic
use of terminology. Some of these terms seem to be used to try to avoid
alienating statists. It is understandable—but ultimately futile, in my
view—why Barnett might want to soften the blow of loaded terms like
libertarian and anarchy and use the kinder, gentler (but blander, less
descriptive, and more misleading) terms liberal and polycentric instead.
In my view it is preferable to call<br />
a spade a spade.<a href="#fn1106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1106"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1106</sup></a> We won’t fool anyone into
supporting anarcho-capitalism by using a fancier term.</p>
<p>Some of the terms employed, such as “several property” and
“polycentric” order, clearly reveal the Hayekian influence on Barnett;
otherHayekian terms such as “spontaneous” and “coordination” are also
sprinkled throughout the book. Nothing seems to be gained except
confusion and lack of clarity by replacing perfectly good terms like
private property and anarcho-capitalism with inferior terms, or even
with equally conceptually valid terms.<a href="#fn1107"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1107"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1107</sup></a></p>
<p>Barnett also uses the expressions “background rights” instead of
natural rights, and “legal precepts” instead of “concrete legal rules”
or some other such descriptive term. I must admit that I like having a
term for operational, concrete legal rules as distinct from more
abstract principles; and “legal precepts” seems, I suppose, as good as
any. But “background rights” does not seem to be an improvement over
terms such as natural or moral or individual rights (or just plain
“rights”). However, these quibbles mainly relate to Barnett’s strategy
or style, not to the substance or soundness of his arguments.</p>
<h4 id="problems-with-the-problems">PROBLEMS WITH THE PROBLEMS</h4>
<p>A consequentialist analysis can be valuable, but one difficulty with
Barnett’s account is that he presumes that the universally shared goals
of peace, prosperity, and happiness can be achieved if only we solve
<em>three</em> main problems (of knowledge, interest, and power). I have
already explained that the Barnettian problems of knowledge are better
reformulated as aimed at conflict-avoidance, and thus peace (and
perhapsat enabling economic calculation, and thus prosperity). A deeper
question is why are these the only problems that get in the way of our
goals? Why are these three problems exhaustive? What about other
purported problems harped on by communitarians, socialists, or other
consequentialists, such as inequality and poverty, commercialism and
consumerism? Barnett’s considers this issue,<a href="#fn1108"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1108"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1108</sup></a> but provides only a brief and
somewhat unconvincing argument that addressing these other problems with
legal coercion would undermine the “foundations” of the “structure of
liberty” and thus prevent the three fundamental problems from being
solved.<a href="#fn1109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1109"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1109</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="conclusion-2">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>As is often the case in a review of this sort, many of my comments
have been critical, but this should not give the impression that I find
fault with the bulk of Barnett’s work. I have focused primarily on the
aspects with which I disagree, and have emphasized economic calculation
and the Hayekian knowledge paradigm, and have largely omitted discussion
of the many valuable ideas in <em>The Structure of Liberty</em>. In
fact, I have profited immensely from many of Barnett’s previous
theories, such as his views on constitutional interpretation, contract
theory, and his tantalizing suggestion that there should be a
presumption against the legitimacy of government statutes in derogation
of common law or liberties—a “presumption of liberty.”<a href="#fn1110"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1110"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1110</sup></a> Most of these are not included or
discussed at length in this treatise. Luckily, Barnett’s next book is
reportedly <em>The Presumption of Liberty: Restoring the
Constitution</em>.<a href="#fn1111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1111"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1111</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Structure of Liberty</em> is an important new work by one of
libertarianism’s most significant and thoughtful legal scholars. Its
primary substantive deficiency is its over-reliance on the Hayekian
knowledge paradigm, but the work nonetheless arrives at the
private-property norms that address the more relevant issue of
interpersonal conflict. The book is full of subtle insights regarding
standards and burdens of proof, restitution, the workings of the common
law, and the operation of anarcho-capitalism. It is must-reading for all
those seriously interested in libertarian theory.</p>

20: Review of <em>Against Politics: On Government, Anarchy, and
Order,</em> by Anthony de Jasay</h3>
<p>Originally published as Stephan Kinsella, “<em>Against Politics: On
Government, Anarchy, and Order</em>. By Anthony de Jasay. London and New
York: Routledge, 1997,” <em>Q. J. Austrian Econ.</em> 1, no. 1. (Fall
1998): 85–93. De Jasay’s book will be referred to herein as <em>Against
Politics</em>.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful collection of previously published articles by
Anthony de Jasay who, it turns out, is an undiscovered Austrian, or at
least a close cousin. The essays in <em>Against Politics</em>, published
between 1989 and 1996, are united around a common theme, the economic
and political aspects of government and “ordered anarchy.” The book is
full of sparkling insight and penetrating, calm dissections of pro-state
arguments. Opponents of the state will find much ammunition here.
Statists (even of the minimalist variety) will find much to ponder.</p>
<p>De Jasay’s arguments pack quite a punch, and make it clear that he is
a powerful, careful scholar. He also appears to be a quasi-Austrian
economist and political theorist, which is surprising given that he does
not appear to be very familiar with the work of Austrian theorists, such
as Mises and Rothbard. Has he even read <em>Human Action</em>? One
wonders. The primary well-known Austrians he cites are Hayek and Wieser,
who represent the “Vienna School” instead of the Austrian school.<a
href="#fn1112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1112"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1112</sup></a> He has apparently come to many
Austrian conclusions without the benefit of much exposure to
Austrianism. For example, he makes good use of the observation that not
only is utility not measurable, but interpersonal utility is also
completely incommensurate.<a href="#fn1113" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1113</sup></a> He even writes
that, “[u]nlike the physical sciences, inference presupposing
purposiveness is proper to the study of reasoning beings and cannot be
avoided without inordinate loss of content,”<a href="#fn1114"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1114"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1114</sup></a> which bears an uncanny similarity
to Mises’s own epistemology.<a href="#fn1115" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1115</sup></a></p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. The seven chapters of Part 1 are
critical of statism, the view that political action is necessary,
efficient, or desirable. In the four chapters of Part 2, our author
somewhat tentatively proffers his own politico-economic theories,
designed to show that various desirable social institutions are possible
without political arrangements. The essays are well-ordered and
generally fit together almost as well as chapters of an integrated work,
although, as is to be expected in a collection of this kind, there is
some repetition and redundancy. (A useful summary of the book’s themes,
structure, and arguments is found in the Introduction, at pp. 4–7.)</p>
<p>De Jasay is a master of criticism. A standard technique is to hold a
statist’s logic up to standards that the statist himself espouses. In a
rare personal glimpse, he reveals an instance of applying this technique
in his own life:</p>
<p>The present writer, when a subject of a “people’s democracy”
[presumably the author’s country of origin, Hungary], used to taunt his
political masters that capitalism had never existed anywhere, that it
was yet to come, it was the “wave of the future”—a taunt that reduced
them to fury but naturally failed to provoke any refutation.<a
href="#fn1116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1116"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1116</sup></a></p>
<p>Given his power of criticism, the critical pieces in Part 1 contain
stronger arguments than Part 2, although for some (such as this
reviewer), the essays in Part 2 will still be of at least as much or
more interest. For although his positive theorizing is weakened by his
own moral skepticism (more on this below), it is strengthened by his
critique of statist alternatives; further, his basic intuitions and
premises are largely sound. Combine this with a multitude of keen
insights and critiques of opposing social theories, and Part 2 is of
immense interest, even with its deficiencies.</p>
<p>Part 1 opens with “Self-Contradictory Contractarianism,” which
addresses the argument that various “intractable” problems of the state
of nature, such as prisoner’s dilemmas and free riding,<a href="#fn1117"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1117"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1117</sup></a> prevent systematic social
cooperation. One way out of these dilemmas would be to make “binding”
contracts. However, people cannot make binding contracts in the state of
nature, since rational actors without fear of sanction will always
default, thereby making contracting impossible and requiring the state
to provide an effective contract enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>But, de Jasay asks, “if contracts require an enforcer, how could
there be a social contract creating an enforcer without <em>its</em>
enforcement being assured by a meta-enforcer created by a meta-social
contract, and so on in an infinite regress.”<a href="#fn1118"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1118"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1118</sup></a> De Jasay recognizes that the
proposed solution assumes that the state can act as an “enforcing agent
acting as a programmed automaton.”<a href="#fn1119" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1119</sup></a> Yet this is to
“assume away the principal-agent problem,”<a href="#fn1120"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1120"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1120</sup></a> since the state has little reason
to restrict itself to enforcing the contract. For these and other
reasons, “[t]here is … no contractual exit from the state of nature: if
the state is to be created by contract, it cannot be created, since it
is its own antecedent condition.”<a href="#fn1121" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1121</sup></a> Thus this
particular ground for the necessity of the state contradicts itself, and
advocates of government are hoisted by their own petard.</p>
<p>De Jasay correctly recognizes that the real question is whether
ordered anarchy (what we would call anarcho-capitalism) is possible or
not, and this question “ultimately boils down to the issue of the
enforcement of mutual promises without a final specialized enforcer.”<a
href="#fn1122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1122"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1122</sup></a> De Jasay seems at home with the
somewhat dubious field of game theory, but this helps to make him
especially suited to criticize its irrelevance to the actual world. He
argues that typical game-theoretical arguments are unrealistic and
inapplicable to real life situations, since “[a]nyone who has a name,
lives in a place, does something for a living—that is, anyone tied into
the fabric of society—would think twice before treating mutual promise
as the single-play prisoner’s dilemma says he must.”<a href="#fn1123"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1123"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1123</sup></a> We can, therefore, expect that
contracts can be self-enforcing, without the aid of a centralized
enforcing agent, and thus at least some of the dilemmas that are claimed
to be part of anarchy are chimerical.<a href="#fn1124"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1124"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1124</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, as argued in chapter 2, “Is Limited Government Possible?,” it
is not proponents of anarcho-capitalism but rather those who advocate
limited government who hold unrealistic views. Our author recognizes
that “[t]here is a plethora of constitutional devices for ‘rigging’
rules and procedures in such a way as to clip the wings of the state.”<a
href="#fn1125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1125"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1125</sup></a> However, the real problem is not
how to invent such devices but to find the conditions, if possible, that
would be likely to be adopted and to stay intact long enough to do any
good.<a href="#fn1126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1126"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1126</sup></a> De Jasay’s economic reasoning
here persuasively demonstrates why no such artificial restriction is
likely to succeed, and why any government can be expected to have a
tendency to grow.<a href="#fn1127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1127"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1127</sup></a></p>
<p>The other chapters of Part 1 are also interesting and insightful.
“Frogs’ Legs, Shared Ends, and the Rationality of Politics”<a
href="#fn1128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1128"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1128</sup></a> argues that political grounds
generally cannot have rational grounds and cannot be rationally
defended. This essay, however, seems more hastily written and more
poorly organized than most others in the book. “The Twistable is Not
Testable,”<a href="#fn1129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1129"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1129</sup></a> a review essay of Popper’s
<em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>,<a href="#fn1130"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1130"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1130</sup></a> shows de Jasay at the height of
his critical powers. In this piece, de Jasay subjects Popper’s own
(socialistic) propositions “to the acid of the very method of which he
is the champion,” the test of falsifiability.<a href="#fn1131"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1131"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1131</sup></a> Popper contended that “[g]enuine
propositions are capable of being corroborated, and are criticized by a
process of confrontation with the ascertainable facts of the case.”<a
href="#fn1132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1132"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1132</sup></a> However, Popper advocated both
democracy and socialism; yet, as de Jasay shows, this advocacy rests
upon the completely unfalsifiable building block descriptions, concepts,
and judgments, such as “weak” and “strong.” For example, these concepts
are essential to the Popperian proposition that social institutions must
be constructed to protect the “economically weak” from the “economically
strong.”<a href="#fn1133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1133"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1133</sup></a> Thus, de Jasay shows that
Popper’s socialism is indefensible by Popper’s very own scientific
standards.<a href="#fn1134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1134"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1134</sup></a></p>
<p>In the course of this essay, de Jasay also deflates the myth that
Popper was a liberal.<a href="#fn1135" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1135</sup></a> Also of interest
is de Jasay’s critical treatment of other prominent liberal economists
and political theorists, notably James Buchanan, F.A. Hayek, and Robert
Nozick. In “Hayek: Some Missing Pieces,”<a href="#fn1136"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1136"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1136</sup></a> for example, de Jasay argues that
Hayek “has no complete theory of the social order to back up his liberal
recommendations.”<a href="#fn1137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1137"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1137</sup></a> In advocating that government
should go beyond the maintenance of law and order to provide amorphous
and endless “highly desirable” public goods, Hayek ends up supporting
virtually unlimited government. De Jasay will have none of this:</p>
<p>A theory of social order is incomplete if it makes no serious attempt
at assessing the long-term forces that make the public sector grow or
shrink. This can hardly be done without relying on a defensible theory
of public goods. Hayek feels no necessity for one. Strangely, the
question seems to have held no interest for him.<a href="#fn1138"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1138"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1138</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, Hayek has not done his homework and his half-baked
political theory endangers the very freedom that he is viewed as
upholding. (The critiques of Nozick and Buchanan are discussed below in
the discussion of Part 2.)</p>
<p>I have mentioned above that de Jasay’s work could be improved if it
built more on and dealt more with contemporary Austrian theory, in
particular Misesian economic theory as well as associated political
theories, such as those of Rothbard. But this is unfair and somewhat
ungrateful. We cannot rightfully criticize him for what he has not done,
especially when what he has done is so significant. It might be better
to say that, given his obvious acuity and talents, it seems a shame that
he has not done so. One can only hope that we see more treatment and use
of Austrian work in his further output.</p>
<p>For example, his discussions of the so-called public goods
“dilemma”<a href="#fn1139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1139"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1139</sup></a> could have profited from the
trenchant insights of Austrians Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe,
among others.<a href="#fn1140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1140"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1140</sup></a> His discussion of why government
will tend to grow<a href="#fn1141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1141"

supplemented by recent Austrian politico-economic theory.<a
href="#fn1142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1142"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1142</sup></a> Rothbard (relying on Schütz)
criticized the empiricist assumption that only “verifiable” (or
falsifiable) propositions are “scientific,” and thus the existence of
human action and even other human actors cannot be scientifically
maintained, on the grounds that the principle of verifiability itself
requires other human beings to exist to replicate experimental
results.<a href="#fn1143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1143"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1143</sup></a> This insight could have been used
with profit in de Jasay’s Popper critique.<a href="#fn1144"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1144"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1144</sup></a> De Jasay’s critiques of Nozick<a

href="#fn1146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1146"

Austrian analysis.<a href="#fn1147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1147"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1147</sup></a></p>
<p>A more serious objection lies in de Jasay’s moral skepticism. His
general skepticism serves him well as a critic, since it leads him
invariably to put the burden of proof on those who advocate the state
and to find their proof wanting. However, his own skepticism goes too
far and is itself unwarranted. It also undercuts his own positive
theorizing, since even that, as tentative as it is, depends on some
modicum of moral judgment or assumptions.</p>
<p>De Jasay seems to believe that the only meaningful propositions are
those that are subject to rational criticism, and that only falsifiable
propositions that can be corroborated or not, fall into this category.
One exception is that “value judgments” that are not merely <em>ad
hoc</em>, i.e., that fit into some coherent hierarchy or system, can
also be criticized if they are not internally consistent.<a
href="#fn1148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1148"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1148</sup></a> I may be too hasty here and may
be unfairly attributing to him a kind of Popperian scientism that he
means to present and critique rather than adopt. However, over and over,
de Jasay denigrates the idea that ends or values can be rational. Thus,
“[w]hat is ultimately unfalsifiable, immune to rational criticism and
useless except as a piece of gratuitous self-expression, is the
stand-alone, ad hoc value judgment.”<a href="#fn1149"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1149"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1149</sup></a></p>
<p>Here is where perhaps the greatest improvement could be made to de
Jasay’s thought by careful consideration of important Austrian work. In
particular, Hoppe’s extension of praxeology into the field of ethics,
the importance of which cannot be overstated, demonstrates that there is
indeed an unchallengeable, rational basis for ethics.<a href="#fn1150"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1150"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1150</sup></a> In fact, in his skepticism and
his subsequently deficient political theorizing, de Jasay has more in
common with Mises than just economics. For Mises himself, as Rothbard
has pointed out, as an opponent of objective ethics, presented a very
weak, half-hearted, and, ultimately, unsuccessful, utilitarian defense
of liberalism.<a href="#fn1151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1151"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1151</sup></a></p>
<p>The most important and interesting essay of Part 2 is “Before
Resorting to Politics,”<a href="#fn1152" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1152</sup></a> which de Jasay
admits is “the book’s most ambitious.”<a href="#fn1153"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1153"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1153</sup></a> In this chapter, he criticizes
consequentialism and other problems that, as he sees it, plague modern
liberal theory. In its stead he “proposes three, admittedly sketchy,
‘principles of politics,’” which are “entailed in the liberal ethic” and
which must be incorporated into the foundations of any coherent liberal
theory.<a href="#fn1154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1154"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1154</sup></a></p>
<p>As noted above, however, de Jasay does not seem to believe that
normative propositions can be justified, and he does not really try to
do so. He just uses the occasional “should” and normative premise where
it is unavoidable, and appears to simply presume that the reader shares
these (uncontroversial) premises, perhaps counting on the reader’s own
good will or love of consistency. For example, he merely asserts that
“[i]t is dubious in the extreme that a political authority is entitled
to employ its power of coercion for imposing value choices on society …
and on individual members.”<a href="#fn1155" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1155</sup></a> Yet the force of
the normative concepts “dubious” and “entitled” here is diluted by the
lack of even an attempt at justification.</p>
<p>De Jasay’s argument is thus a hypothetical one—and I am not sure if
he would disagree, for I am not sure he thinks anything better is
possible—for it relies for its persuasiveness on the listener already
valuing (for some reason) the goals of justice, efficiency, and order.
Nevertheless, because most of these principles are certainly sound and
justifiable anyway (for example, using Rothbard’s or Hoppe’s ethical
theory), and because de Jasay’s critical and analytical skills are so
acute, much of interest emerges from this essay.</p>
<p>His three principles of politics are: (1) if in doubt, abstain from
political action;<a href="#fn1156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1156"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1156</sup></a>(2) the feasible is presumed
free;<a href="#fn1157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1157"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1157</sup></a> and (3) let exclusion stand.<a
href="#fn1158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1158"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1158</sup></a> The justification of principle
(1) begins with a vigorous critique of consequentialism. De Jasay notes
that most political action requires assessing the worth or value of
various policies. Drawing on the idea that interpersonal utility and
values are incommensurate, de Jasay points out that we can rarely know
if any proposed government measure is really “worth it” or not.<a
href="#fn1159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1159"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1159</sup></a> Thus, government action, which
necessarily employs the power of coercion, should be avoided where
possible; the burden of proof should be on those agitating for it. This
entails a corollary principle, “that applying coercion is legitimate
when it is positively invited by the prospective coercee.” <a
href="#fn1160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1160"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1160</sup></a></p>
<p>Next, in principle (2), “the feasible is presumed free,” de Jasay
asserts that “[t]he basic rule is that a person is presumed free to do
what is feasible for him to do,”<a href="#fn1161" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1161</sup></a> as long as the
proposed feasible action is not ruled out by his own obligations or the
possibility of harm to others. We should live by right and not by
permission, presumably in part because the former situation is more
workable and efficient. If a feasible action is thus presumed free, then
the actor need not prove that the action is permissible; rather, the
burden is on he who challenges the permissibility of the action.<a
href="#fn1162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1162"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1162</sup></a> Otherwise, an actor might be
unable to ever act since it would be essentially very difficult to prove
a negative by showing that no one will be harmed.<a href="#fn1163"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1163"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1163</sup></a></p>
<p>Incidentally, de Jasay offers an interesting critique of Nozick’s
conception of rights here. By viewing rights as “permissions” to do
something, rather than as claims for performance by another, Nozick
perhaps unwittingly endorses a system in which action is not presumed
free, as action is undertaken with “permission” by others, which
presumably must first be granted.<a href="#fn1164" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1164</sup></a></p>
<p>I found the justification of principle (3), “let exclusion stand,” to
be of most interest, especially the discussion of homesteading or
appropriation of unowned goods.<a href="#fn1165" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1165</sup></a> De Jasay equates
property with its owner’s “excluding” others from using it, for example
by fencing in immovable property (land) or finding or creating (and
keeping) movable property (corporeal, tangible objects). Thus, the
principle means “let ownership stand,” i.e., that claims to ownership of
property appropriated from the state of nature or acquired ultimately
through a chain of title tracing back to such an appropriation should be
respected.</p>
<p>The basic defense of the Lockean proposition that the first or
original appropriator of property is entitled to appropriate it draws on
his previous “feasible” principle (2) as well as his distinction between
rights and liberties. Others have objected to the idea that one can
appropriate unowned property on the grounds that such an action
unilaterally (and thus unjustifiably) imposes on others moral duties to
refrain from interfering.</p>
<p>The basic defense, however, is quite general and straightforward. It
is that if a prospective owner <em>can</em> in fact perform it, taking
first possession of a thing is a feasible act of his that is
<em>admissible</em> if it is <em>not a tort</em> (in this case not
trespass) and violates no right; but this is the case by definition,
i.e., by the thing being identified as “unowned.”<a href="#fn1166"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1166"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1166</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, by treating individuals as being free to act unless it
contravenes a right (claim) of another, there is simply no reason
<em>not</em> to allow a person to appropriate unowned property. For who
could object, if not another, prior owner? To be entitled to object is
to be able to “exclude” the claimant, but the right to exclude is an
incident of ownership, and the property is by presumption unowned. No
one can validly object to my appropriating unowned property, then,
because, assuming feasible actions are free, any objection itself must
claim a right, and this itself raises a type of ownership claim.<a
href="#fn1167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1167"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1167</sup></a></p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that it avoids the troublesome
“Lockean proviso,” which allows homesteading of unowned goods only so
long as “enough and as good is left to others.”<a href="#fn1168"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1168"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1168</sup></a> Nozick, on the other hand,
allowed appropriation of an unowned object only if it did not worsen the
situation of others. However, de Jasay points out, in a world with
finite resources, this condition would make it impossible for any
unowned property to be ever used, since any appropriation causes a loss
of opportunity for others to homestead the object and thereby worsens
their situation. By contrast, de Jasay’s position “does not require that
nobody loses as a result of first possession, as long as the losses were
not vested interests.”<a href="#fn1169" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1169</sup></a></p>
<p>De Jasay’s application of his appropriation rule to two basic types
of appropriation is also worth study. These two types are “finding and
keeping” and “enclosure.”<a href="#fn1170" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1170</sup></a> The former appears
to apply primarily to movable objects that may be found, taken, and
hidden or used exclusively. Since the thing has no other owner,
<em>prima facie,</em> no one is entitled to object to the first
possessor claiming ownership. Other grounds for opposing this might be
that the thing was found at least partly by luck, and was thus
undeserved. But for this to be relevant, there would have to be a
general rule requiring the lucky in life to compensate the unlucky. But
such a rule rests on a simply unsupportable assertion.</p>
<p>For immovable property (land), possession is taken by “enclosing” the
land and incurring exclusion costs, e.g., erecting a fence. As in the
case with movables, others’ loss of the opportunity to appropriate the
property does not give rise to a claim sufficient to oust the first
possessor (if it did, it would be an ownership claim). However, for
those who used to occasionally enjoy access to and use of the property,
they do lose an actual benefit.<a href="#fn1171" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1171" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1171</sup></a> De Jasay admits
that he cannot do full justice to this difficult issue, but offers a
tentative solution. If some people previously used the property merely
in passing, on an ad hoc basis, no right of theirs is violated by the
homesteader enclosing it. However, if some identifiable, closed set of
persons have used the property regularly enough to establish a precedent
on which they rely, compensation must be paid them by the new owner.<a
href="#fn1172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1172"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1172</sup></a> (It is unclear why this regular
use and “precedent” does not itself establish an ownership claim on
behalf of the prior users; but de Jasay is here speaking of borderline
cases.)</p>
<p>Other chapters in Part 2 argue that rational choices by individuals
in the state of nature can be expected to lead to enforcement of
property rights and contractual promises.<a href="#fn1173"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1173"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1173</sup></a> This chapter also shows that
James Buchanan’s interpretation of Hobbes and history is incorrect, and
that proper understanding of both supports the idea that markets can
exist prior to and without states, contra Buchanan.<a href="#fn1174"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1174"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1174</sup></a> In the last chapter, “Liberties,
Rights, and the Standing of Groups,”<a href="#fn1175"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1175"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1175</sup></a> one has to agree with his
conclusion that “group rights” are problematic, and the proper bearers
of rights are individuals.</p>
<p>This is a thought-provoking book. I have only been able to touch upon
some of the nuances and important insights it contains. This work is an

INTRODUCTION: THE INSTRUMENTAL VALUE OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION</h4>
<p>We Americans are lucky indeed to have inherited our Constitution and
our classical liberal tradition. For suppose we had inherited a
totalitarian form of government, a government that did not respect
property rights or other individual rights, that arbitrarily
discriminated against—even executed or exterminated—certain classes of
its subjects from time to time.<a href="#fn1177" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1177" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1177</sup></a> If such a
government on occasion failed to implement its totalitarian
“constitution” to the letter—say, it was slow to adopt a fully
socialized agriculture policy or temporarily retreated from such a
policy after causing the starvation of a few million people—it is
unlikely even the strictest “originalists” in that society would
complain that the government was shirking its duties under the
totalitarian constitution. The totalitarian constitution itself—the
basic plan underlying the government—would be seen by even the
originalists as inherently illegitimate, with no purpose served by
advocating stricter adherence to its precepts. No purpose in service of
liberty, at least.<a href="#fn1178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1178"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1178</sup></a></p>
<p>Under a totalitarian system, proponents of liberty and individual
rights<a href="#fn1179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1179"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1179</sup></a> would be relegated to other
tactics, such as fomenting revolution or civil disobedience, trying to
persuade or educate society or government officials to see the light of
liberty, or even advocating outright dishonest interpretation of the
constitution to achieve better results.<br />
A constitution, then, has only instrumental value; it is worth
supporting and interpreting honestly only if such an interpretation
would tend to lead to desirable results. To a supporter of individual
rights, for example, a constitution providing for an explicitly
totalitarian system does not have instrumental value, and he would not
seek to have such a constitution put into effect or put into effect more
stringently.</p>
<p>Now imagine that there is a better constitution in place, one
originally designed to undergird limited government and individual
rights. Over the decades, however, the government has incrementally
misconstrued this constitution, seizing more and more power not
authorized by it. Imagine also that, for a variety of reasons, the
population had acquiesced, and even grown somewhat accustomed, to this
state of affairs.<a href="#fn1180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1180"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1180</sup></a> Advocates of limited government
and individual rights in this setting have an option available to them
that those in our hypothetical socialist society do not: they can insist
that the government respect the constitution’s original meaning. They
can argue, for example, that the supreme court has been misinterpreting
the constitution and should now interpret the constitution in accordance
with its original understanding.<a href="#fn1181" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1181" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1181</sup></a> Given the
country’s traditional respect for the constitution and at least some
widespread sentiment that the government’s very legitimacy depends on
its acting within limits proscribed by the constitution, this might be a
reasonable, even hopeful, course to take.<a href="#fn1182"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1182"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1182</sup></a></p>
<p>America is largely in this latter situation since our Constitution
was originally designed to establish limited government. It is for this
reason that I say that we Americans are lucky to have inherited our
Constitution and our classical liberal tradition. We are not limited to
the unattractive options of revolution or despairing resignation as our
only responses to government tyranny. We can urge the Supreme Court and
Congress to respect individual rights and limit government powers in
accordance with the original design of the Constitution. Our
Constitution has instrumental value—at least for those who support
limited government and both personal and economic individual freedom.<a
href="#fn1183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1183"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1183</sup></a></p>
<p>One problem with trying to persuade the Court to move towards a more
originalist interpretation of the Constitution is that, even if the
Court wants to do this, it may be too late. Given the entrenched and
accumulated accretions of government power and court decisions that have
resulted from over a century of misinterpretation of the Constitution,<a
href="#fn1184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1184"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1184</sup></a> the Supreme Court is unlikely to
simply undo its own jurisprudence and interpret the Constitution anew.
Further, even if the Court wanted to start reining in the federal
government’s powers, it would not be able to get away with it, at least
not without a sufficiently sneaky or clever theory that would allow some
incremental movement toward liberty in a manner not obvious enough to
catch the Leviathan’s eye.</p>
<p>In his new book, <em>Silent Rights: The Ninth Amendment and the
Constitution’s Unenumerated Rights</em>, Professor Calvin R. Massey
seeks to provide such a “stealth” theory (my words, not his) by
providing a new way to read the Ninth Amendment. As Massey points out,
this amendment has been largely ignored since its addition to the
Constitution in 1791.<a href="#fn1185" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1185" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1185</sup></a> In this book,
Massey proposes a novel and somewhat radical theory to reincorporate the
Amendment and its original purposes into the current constitutional
landscape. At the heart of Massey’s theory is his proposed
“constitutional cy pres doctrine”<a href="#fn1186" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1186" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1186</sup></a> and his contention
that the Ninth Amendment incorporates rights based in state law.<a
href="#fn1187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1187"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1187</sup></a> Before further exploring this
theory, it is necessary to delve into, as Massey does, the history and
political context of the Ninth Amendment.</p>
<h4 id="ii.-the-dual-purposes-of-the-ninth-amendment">II. THE DUAL
PURPOSES OF THE NINTH AMENDMENT</h4>
<p>The Ninth Amendment provides as follows: “The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or
disparage others retained by the people.”<a href="#fn1188"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1188"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1188</sup></a> It follows, of course, the
various rights enumerated in the first eight amendments in the Bill of
Rights, and it precedes the Tenth Amendment.<a href="#fn1189"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1189"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1189</sup></a> In a discussion of the original
debate concerning the Ninth Amendment, Massey points out that there are
many possible answers as to just what the Ninth Amendment means:</p>
<p>Some, like former Judge Robert Bork, contend that the amendment has
no discernible meaning whatever. Others … suggest that the amendment is
merely hortatory and duplicative of the axiomatic reminder in the Tenth
Amendment that the states retain all powers not surrendered under the
Constitution. Still others … contend that the amendment prohibits the
federal government from exercising any power with respect to the “rights
retained by the people.” … Yet another view … asserts that the Ninth
Amendment was merely a cautionary device to check unwarranted extension
of the powers of the federal government. Some … suggest that the
amendment is best regarded as a … rule of interpretation [that]
invalidates [the] argument that any given right (such as the right to
use contraceptives) is not to be included within some enumerated right
of the Constitution (such as due process) simply because the right to
use contraceptives is not expressly enumerated in the Constitution….
Finally, [some] contend that the amendment ought to be treated as an
independent source of substantive and judicially enforceable individual
rights, determined without reference to any of the enumerated rights.<a
href="#fn1190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1190"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1190</sup></a></p>
<p>As Massey explains, one of the objectives of the Ninth Amendment was
to preserve the states’ sovereignty and independence, in part so that
the states could serve as a check on expansions of federal power.<a
href="#fn1191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1191"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1191</sup></a> To this end, the central
government was vested only with a few defined powers, reserving other
powers to the states.<a href="#fn1192" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1192</sup></a> Protection of the
natural rights of citizens, for example, would be largely a matter for
the states to handle.<a href="#fn1193" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1193" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1193</sup></a> Because of the
limited delegation of power to the federal government, the Federalists
did not believe an enumerated bill of rights to be necessary.<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1194</sup></a> Without the granted
<em>power</em> to invade rights, the federal government would simply be
unable to do so.</p>
<p>The Antifederalists, nevertheless, demanded a bill of rights, fearing
that without one, the federal government would both encroach on the
states’ sovereignty and violate the natural rights of the people.<a
href="#fn1195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1195"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1195</sup></a> History has proven the
Antifederalists right; it would have been too dangerous to create the
federal government without also providing a bill of rights. Although the
current federal government has arrogated for itself vast powers not
authorized by the Constitution,<a href="#fn1196" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1196" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1196</sup></a> it seems almost
certain that things would have been worse had the Bill of Rights not
been added as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as the Federalists countered, even if having no
bill of rights would be dangerous, enumerating rights to limit a
government of purportedly limited powers is also dangerous, for two
primary reasons. First, the very declaration of a particular right
(e.g., freedom of speech) might be construed to imply that some power
had been given to the federal government to invade this right.<a
href="#fn1197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1197"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1197</sup></a> This could lead to the
implication that the federal government possessed <em>un</em>enumerated
powers, similar to the broad “police powers” exercised by states, rather
than strictly limited, enumerated powers. These unenumerated powers of
the central government could be used to invade any (unenumerated) rights
of the citizenry as well as the sovereignty of the states.<a
href="#fn1198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1198"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1198</sup></a> Second, listing certain rights in
the “bill of rights might raise the implication that the only rights
possessed by the people were those enumerated,”<a href="#fn1199"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1199"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1199</sup></a> that is, that the listing of
rights in the Constitution was exhaustive. Enter the Ninth Amendment,
designed, as Massey shows, to combat both these dangers.</p>
<p>Some commentators acknowledge that the Amendment was meant only to
address the first of these two dangers by serving as a rule of
construction as to federal powers. Under this “single-purpose”
interpretation, it is held that:</p>
<p>[T]he amendment’s function was merely to restrain constitutional
interpreters from construing too broadly the powers delegated to the
central government. By doing so, it had the secondary effect of
preserving individual liberties, because the “residual rights” of the
citizenry were protected by the sheer absence of governmental power to
curtail them.<a href="#fn1200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1200"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1200</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the Amendment merely served as a rule of construction regarding
federal powers, and “adherents to this view reject the idea that the
Ninth Amendment is itself an independent source of human rights capable
of judicial cognizance.”<a href="#fn1201" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1201</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey disagrees with such a single-purpose interpretation of the
Ninth Amendment. He argues persuasively that the Ninth Amendment had
dual, but complementary, purposes: To prevent the listing of rights from
being used to imply that the federal government had powers beyond those
enumerated, <em>and</em> to prevent the listing of rights from implying
that the list is an exclusive and exhaustive one.<a href="#fn1202"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1202"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1202</sup></a> For example, as Massey notes,
many states admitted to the Union in the nineteenth century added a
version of the Ninth Amendment to their own constitutions:</p>
<p>It is hard to understand why any group of state constitution makers
would have done so if they had thought the Ninth Amendment was simply a
device to confine federal legislative power…. The presence of Ninth
Amendment analogues in state constitutions is reason to conclude that
nineteenth-century legal actors continued to regard the federal Ninth
Amendment as instantiating dual paths to a single end of preserving
human liberty.<a href="#fn1203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1203"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1203</sup></a></p>
<p>The distinction between the dual purposes of the Ninth Amendment was
not completely clear two hundred years ago. One reason for this, Massey
claims, is that, in the Founding Fathers’ generation, “rights were
thought of as the absence of governmental powers,”<a href="#fn1204"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1204"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1204</sup></a> that is, individual rights were
merely conceived of “as the complement of governmental powers.”<a
href="#fn1205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1205"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1205</sup></a> Thus, to the Framers, the
distinction between these two purposes was “blurry at best.”<a
href="#fn1206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1206"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1206</sup></a> Individual rights could be
secured simply by limiting government power, since “rights could not
lawfully be invaded by a government lacking power to do so.”<a
href="#fn1207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1207"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1207</sup></a> However, today’s conception of
the relation between individual rights and governmental power is
different. Massey claims that:</p>
<p>Today we would be unlikely to converse in the same vernacular. We are
likely to think of rights as trumping governmental powers. Thus,
pursuant to the commerce clause Congress may have the <em>power</em> to
enact a law forbidding the interstate shipment of Bibles, but its
effective ability to do so is trumped by at least two First Amendment
<em>rights</em>—freedom of speech and the right to free exercise of
religion.<a href="#fn1208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1208"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1208</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey provides a brief survey of Supreme Court jurisprudence to
document the changing conception of rights vis-a-vis powers.<a
href="#fn1209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1209"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1209</sup></a> Because of this “shift in
perspective over the past two centuries,” there is disagreement today
over what the Framers originally meant by the Amendment.<a
href="#fn1210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1210"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1210</sup></a> Modern observers tend to ascribe
to the Ninth Amendment merely the first objective, that of preventing
the enumeration of rights from implying that the federal government must
therefore possess unenumerated powers to invade rights, since this seems
to be synonymous with the purpose of the Tenth Amendment, that is, to
preserve a separate sphere of state powers. This view, however, ignores
the Ninth Amendment’s other purpose of ensuring “that the catalog of
constitutional rights did not stop with the enumerated rights. As rights
no longer were thought of as the absence of governmental powers, but
rather as independent restraints upon governmental powers, it was
inevitable that the lost function of the Ninth Amendment would again be
perceived.”<a href="#fn1211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1211"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1211</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey also argues that the interrelationship between the Ninth and
Tenth Amendments can be better explained if one realizes that the
founding generation viewed rights and powers as complementary, that is,
merely two sides of the same coin.<a href="#fn1212" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1212</sup></a> In order to secure
individual rights against infringement by the federal government, both
Amendments were necessary to constrain the government’s powers.<a
href="#fn1213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1213"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1213</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ninth would do so by guarding against either the inference of
nonexistent unenumerated rights or the inference of constructive powers.
The Tenth would do so by an explicit statement that the central
government possessed only its specified powers. The Tenth Amendment may
be seen as performing the principal function of rebutting the
Antifederalist concern that the new government might be presumed to
possess all powers not specifically retained, while the Ninth Amendment
may be seen as primarily addressing the Federalist concern that any
enumeration of rights might be viewed as recognition of the existence of
implied governmental powers. But both amendments are more complex. The
Ninth Amendment also addresses, in part, the fear that rights
enumeration would eliminate other rights, and the Tenth also preserves
to the people their discretionary authority to allocate (or not) powers
to their state governmental agents. The complex and dual nature of the
two amendments is deeply rooted in the founding generation’s perceptions
of the inextricable relationship between rights and powers. Thus, the
lack of either amendment would be inimical to the preservation of a zone
of individual autonomy where governments could not intrude.<a
href="#fn1214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1214"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1214</sup></a></p>
<p>As Massey points out, even if it is admitted that the Ninth Amendment
“could be a proper constitutional basis for unenumerated rights[, this]
does nothing to solve the enormous problem of selecting <em>which</em>
unenumerated rights deserve designation as constitutionally
protected.”<a href="#fn1215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1215"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1215</sup></a> Under Massey’s theory of
“constitutional cy pres doctrine,” elaborated in Part III of <em>Silent
Rights</em>, he lets the states do most of this work for us.<a
href="#fn1216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1216"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1216</sup></a> It is to this doctrine that we
now turn.</p>
<h4 id="iii.-constitutional-cy-pres">III. CONSTITUTIONAL CY PRES</h4>
<p>It is largely undisputed, even by single-purpose theorists, that the
Ninth Amendment was intended to prevent the enumeration of rights from
implying federal powers not explicitly granted in the Constitution.
However, “apart from a radical reconstruction of existing doctrine, that
intent can no longer be accomplished.”<a href="#fn1217"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1217"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1217</sup></a> As Massey puts it:</p>
<p>After two centuries of constitutional development, we no longer make
any serious attempt to control the extent of the implied powers of
Congress. If the Ninth Amendment’s original intent was only to provide a
rule of construction by which claims of implied congressional power
would be rejected, that function has been irretrievably eclipsed by the
awesome breadth of contemporary federal power.<a href="#fn1218"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1218"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1218</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, it is now, perhaps regrettably, “impossible” to
achieve the Ninth Amendment’s original function of limiting the implied
powers of the federal government (the limited-powers function). The
genie is, irrevocably, out of the bottle.</p>
<p>It is here that Massey borrows from the concept cy pres to announce
his “constitutional” cy pres doctrine. Under the doctrine of cy pres,
“[w]hen faced with the problem of an expressed testamentary intent that
is impossible to achieve, courts seek to effectuate as nearly as
possible (cy pres) the testator’s intent.”<a href="#fn1219"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1219"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1219</sup></a> Similarly, if we still wish to
“preserve the supposed original function of preventing implied federal
powers,”<a href="#fn1220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1220"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1220</sup></a> a new interpretation must be
given to the Ninth Amendment to attempt to limit governmental power.<a
href="#fn1221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1221"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1221</sup></a> In fact, “To effectuate the
original intent as nearly as possible, it is necessary to constrain
governmental power by reading the Ninth Amendment as a source of
judicially enforceable individual rights that operate to limit the
exercise of governmental power.”<a href="#fn1222" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1222" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1222</sup></a> Thus, in today’s
context, even those who attribute only the limited-powers function to
the Ninth Amendment must be willing to accept use of the Amendment to
generate unenumerated rights if the amendment is to be at all effective
in limiting the exercise and unwarranted expansions of governmental
power:</p>
<p>If the original intention of the amendment was to confine
governmental power, the reason for doing so was entirely to preserve
rights. We have failed to confine those powers, partly because we now
regard the affirmative assertion of rights as the vehicle for
controlling the unwarranted assumption of governmental power. Thus, the
only way the Ninth Amendment can be applied in our times to accomplish
its original purpose is to regard the amendment as an independent source
of individual rights.<a href="#fn1223" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1223" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1223</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey notes that the second (unenumerated-rights) purpose of the
Ninth Amendment (preventing the implication that enumerated rights were
the only rights capable of blocking governmental action) is not really
impossible, as is the limited-powers purpose, “but the legitimacy of
this endeavor is badly eroded by our undue reliance upon an
inappropriate and ill-suited vehicle—the due process clause—for the task
of providing constitutional recognition to unenumerated rights,”<a
href="#fn1224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1224"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1224</sup></a> that is, only a strained
interpretation of the Due Process Clause allows it to be mined as a
source for unenumerated rights. Therefore, “[s]traight-forward
recognition of the Ninth Amendment as the vehicle for this project would
be consistent with the founding intentions as well as provide a more
ready answer to those critics of unenumerated rights who loudly question
the connection of those rights to the constitutional text.”<a
href="#fn1225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1225"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1225</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey consoles those who are uncomfortable with using a cy pres-type
doctrine to interpret the Constitution by showing that this type of
reasoning is not really without precedent, although Massey’s jazzy term
“constitutional cy pres” appears not to have been used before. For
example, the Court gave “an expansive reading to the due process and
equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment in order to
accomplish the intended purposes of the privileges and immunities
clause”<a href="#fn1226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1226"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1226</sup></a> when the <em>Slaughter-House
Cases</em><a href="#fn1227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1227"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1227</sup></a> decision, and the lack of will to
overturn that decision, made it impossible to implement the original
purposes of this clause. Other supposed examples of constitutional cy
pres include cases involving the Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments.<a
href="#fn1228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1228"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1228</sup></a></p>
<p>But the utility of Massey’s appeal to constitutional cy pres is
unclear. In a standard cy pres situation where, for some external
reason, it is actually impossible to achieve the testator’s will, the
court attempts to effectuate as nearly as possible the testator’s
intent. However, if today it is impossible to honestly interpret the
Constitution and to give the Ninth Amendment its original reading, this
is not due to some impersonal, external cause about which the Court is
helpless to do anything. Instead, it is largely the Court’s own twisting
of the Constitution over the last two centuries, as well as its current
unwillingness to return to a traditional reading of the Constitution,
that lies behind the current impossibility of limiting the federal
government’s powers.<a href="#fn1229" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1229</sup></a> The government
will be equally unable to implement a proposed law or regulation if it
is declared by the Court to be unconstitutional on the grounds that (a)
it did not have the power (an “impossible” result nowadays), or (b)
unenumerated Ninth Amendment rights stand in the way (Massey’s cy pres
method). Thus, one wonders why the Court would overturn a law based on
an unenumerated right, given its unwillingness to do so on the ground
that there is a lack of legitimate governmental power to implement the
law in the first place. It is not as if Congress or the President would
be any less upset at being thwarted by the Court in the second manner as
opposed to the first.<a href="#fn1230" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1230</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey appears to believe that the reason for the current
impossibility of using the Ninth Amendment to limit directly the federal
government’s powers is the aforementioned shift in how rights and powers
are viewed.<a href="#fn1231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1231"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1231</sup></a> He claims that “[w]e have failed
to confine [the federal government’s] powers, partly because we now
regard the affirmative assertion of rights as the vehicle for
controlling the unwarranted assumption of governmental power.”<a
href="#fn1232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1232"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1232</sup></a> This claim is unconvincing,
however, since Massey does not provide a clear case as to just how the
alleged shift in viewing powers and rights has led to a failure to
confine the government’s usurpation of more and more powers. Massey’s
account makes decades of misinterpretation of the Constitution by the
Court seem downright innocent, an honest mistake caused by simple
confusion over the conceptual relation between rights and powers. More
conventional, and less benign, explanations for the unfortunate state of
the Court’s modern jurisprudence seem more appropriate.<a href="#fn1233"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1233"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1233</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, there are other, less serious, problems with Massey’s
cy pres approach. First, Massey’s theory claims to work even if one
adheres only to the limited-powers purpose. In this case, however, it is
inexplicable why so much attention is given earlier in the book to
proving that the Amendment had a dual purpose. After showing in Part II
that the Ninth Amendment had dual purposes,<a href="#fn1234"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1234"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1234</sup></a> Massey largely omits the second
purpose and assumes, for the sake of argument, only the limited-powers
purpose.</p>
<p>Second, in Part II, prior to his cy pres analysis in Part III, Massey
argues, <em>without</em> appealing to cy pres, that one function of the
amendment was to generate enforceable, unenumerated rights.<a
href="#fn1235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1235"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1235</sup></a> It is, therefore, not clear why
one needs to use cy pres to turn the limiting-powers function into the
unenumerated-rights function. The unenumerated-rights function should
stand alone and can apparently be reasonably argued without the aid of
constitutional cy pres. In fact, in an earlier incarnation of Massey’s
theory, the doctrine of constitutional cy pres is not invoked at all.<a
href="#fn1236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1236"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1236</sup></a> As best I can tell, the primary
purpose of constitutional cy pres is to convince those who favor the
limited-powers function but who shun the unenumerated-rights function
that, in today’s constitutional landscape, the only way to achieve the
limited-powers function is to allow the Ninth Amendment to be construed
to protect unenumerated rights. Since Massey sets forth other,
independent grounds for the unenumerated-rights function of the Ninth
Amendment, it is not clear why constitutional cy pres is given such
prominent attention in the book, nor why it is brought up again and
again once this point is made. For example, Massey’s application of
constitutional cy pres to the unenumerated powers purpose of the Ninth
Amendment is confusing. If the unenumerated powers purpose is not
impossible to attain but has merely had its legitimacy eroded, why is cy
pres applicable at all, since the doctrine has to do with impossible or
unattainable purposes?</p>
<p>Third, it appears to be quite an ordinary and reasonable interpretive
method to try to interpret difficult or ambiguous constitutional
provisions in accordance with the provision’s original objectives, just
as was done in the cases cited by Massey as examples of “de facto”
applications of constitutional cy pres. But this technique is just one
of dozens of standard canons of interpretation of legislation or
constitutional provisions,<a href="#fn1237" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1237" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1237</sup></a> and it is not
clear why a new terminology and doctrine is needed for this one
particular technique.<a href="#fn1238" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1238" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1238</sup></a></p>
<p>Continuing with the development of his theory, Massey next argues
that “there are three major ways in which constitutional cy pres can be
applied to the Ninth Amendment.”<a href="#fn1239" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1239" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1239</sup></a> First, the
amendment can be used to secure “against federal invasion individual
rights having their origin in state constitutions.”<a href="#fn1240"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1240"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1240</sup></a> Massey refers to this as the
positive law component of the Ninth Amendment, or “positive Ninth
Amendment rights.”<a href="#fn1241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1241"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1241</sup></a> Second, it can be read as a rule
of interpretation in favor of generalizing explicitly enumerated
constitutional rights to protect unenumerated rights that are
<em>consistent with</em> the enumerated rights. Third, the Ninth
Amendment can be used “to locate and enforce rights having their origin
in natural law.”<a href="#fn1242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1242"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1242</sup></a> Massey refers to this third
approach as the natural law component of the Ninth Amendment, or
“natural Ninth Amendment rights.”<a href="#fn1243" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1243" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1243</sup></a></p>
<p>The listing of these three proposals reveals further problems with
Massey’s theory. One is that this list of three ways to apply
constitutional cy pres seems arbitrary. Further, it is unclear whether
this list is exhaustive: Are there more ways to apply constitutional cy
pres? Why, for example, could not his cy pres theory be used to argue
that the Fourteenth Amendment and the incorporation doctrine should be
reinterpreted to return more power to the states, to better accomplish
the original constitutional function of federalism?</p>
<p>Another problem with Massey’s constitutional cy pres theory is that
the second and third proposals do not need constitutional cy pres to be
recommended, and in fact have been advanced by others, without requiring
Massey’s innovative cy pres theory.<a href="#fn1244"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1244"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1244</sup></a> Massey himself has previously
argued for the first proposal without even mentioning consitutional cy
pres.<a href="#fn1245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1245"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1245</sup></a> Massey seems to view the second
proposal as largely subsumed by, and inferior to, the first and third
proposals,<a href="#fn1246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1246"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1246</sup></a> and thus devotes most of the
remainder of the book—chapters 5 and 6—to elaborating positive and
natural Ninth Amendment rights.</p>
<h4 id="iv.-positive-ninth-amendment-rights">IV. POSITIVE NINTH
AMENDMENT RIGHTS</h4>
<p>The most innovative and controversial aspect of Massey’s thesis is
his view that the Ninth Amendment ought to be read to include judicially
enforceable rights having their origin in state constitutions, as well
as natural rights. Massey argues that the unenumerated rights
contemplated by the Ninth Amendment were of the following two types:
“natural” and “civil,” or “positive,” rights.<a href="#fn1247"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1247"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1247</sup></a> Natural rights include, in the
words of Madison, “those rights which are retained when particular
powers are given up to be exercised by the Legislature,”<a
href="#fn1248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1248"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1248</sup></a> and positive rights are those
that “result from the nature of the compact.”<a href="#fn1249"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1249"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1249</sup></a> For example, freedom of speech is
a natural right; trial by jury is not a natural right, but results “from
the social compact which regulates the action of the community.”<a
href="#fn1250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1250"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1250</sup></a> However, Massey cleverly reasons
that:</p>
<p>… the founding generation did not use the distinction between natural
and positive rights as a basis for selection of the rights worthy of
constitutional enumeration. The package of rights expressly enumerated
in the Constitution contains natural and positive rights. It is a fair
inference, then, that the unenumerated rights of the Ninth Amendment
were thought to consist of both varieties. Positive rights had their
source in state common, constitutional, and statutory law. Natural
rights stemmed from Lockean notions concerning the inalienable rights of
the people.<a href="#fn1251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1251"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1251</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the Ninth Amendment’s unenumerated rights contain both positive
and natural rights.</p>
<p>As Massey notes, most of the Framers looked “to the states not only
as the source of, but as the vehicle for, protection of their cherished
liberties.”<a href="#fn1252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1252"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1252</sup></a> “The inclusion of the Ninth
Amendment was, in part, an attempt to be certain that rights protected
by state law were not supplanted by federal law simply because they were
not enumerated.”<a href="#fn1253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1253"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1253</sup></a> Since “the Ninth Amendment was as
much an enumerated right for purposes of judicial enforcement as any
other aspect of the Bill of Rights,”<a href="#fn1254"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1254"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1254</sup></a> both types of unenumerated
rights—natural rights and positive rights having their source in state
law—are subject to judicial protection. In other words, any federal law
that violates an unenumerated positive (i.e., state law-based) right is
subject to being stricken down by federal courts as violative of the
Ninth Amendment.<a href="#fn1255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1255"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1255</sup></a> In giving effect to the Ninth
Amendment, then, the courts are to recognize that one source of the
unenumerated rights protected by the Ninth Amendment is state
constitutions.</p>
<p>One advantage that Massey sees in this understanding of the Ninth
Amendment is that it would give “citizens of the states … the power,
through their state constitutions, to preserve areas of individual life
from invasion by the federal Congress in the exercise of its delegated
powers.”<a href="#fn1256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1256"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1256</sup></a> This, in turn, would “prevent
Congress from using its delegated powers to contravene an unenumerated
federal right contained within a state constitution.”<a href="#fn1257"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1257"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1257</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey recognizes that his theory “is radical stuff,”<a
href="#fn1258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1258"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1258</sup></a> and also admits that the
implementation of his theory would give rise to “a number of
difficulties,” none of which, however, “are indisputably insuperable.”<a
href="#fn1259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1259"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1259</sup></a> The first difficulty is whether
state-sourced positive rights protected by the Ninth Amendment “are a
set of rights antecedent to the federal Constitution and, thus,
effectively frozen in time and content, or whether such rights are a
dynamic, evolving list that change as sentiment shifts within the
states.”<a href="#fn1260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1260"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1260</sup></a> Massey admits that there is much
to be said for the static view, but ultimately concludes, albeit
unsatisfactorily and confusingly,<a href="#fn1261" class="footnote-ref"

concept holds more promise.”<a href="#fn1262" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1262</sup></a> (Interestingly, in
an earlier version of his theory, Massey <em>rejected</em> the dynamic
concept in favor of the static, on the grounds that the “more radical”
dynamic conception “poses enormous practical problems” that make it
“hopelessly unworkable.”<a href="#fn1263" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1263" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1263</sup></a>)</p>
<p>The dynamic view leads to further difficulties. For example, can
these federalized, state-sourced rights be applied uniformly across the
nation? Can such rights, once created, be altered or abolished by the
states removing the rights from their constitutions?<a href="#fn1264"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1264"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1264</sup></a> Massey grapples mightily with
these and other thorny problems that his own theory has engendered. On
the one hand, positive Ninth Amendment rights could be uniformly applied
across the entire nation, what Massey terms the “national concept” of
positive Ninth Amendment rights.<a href="#fn1265" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1265" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1265</sup></a> Where state
constitutional norms conflict, however, the Court would have to decide
which one to prefer, a job “of considerable difficulty and
uncertainty.”<a href="#fn1266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1266"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1266</sup></a> As for whether these rights are
permanent or not, Massey concludes, for reasons that are not made
entirely clear, that once such rights are recognized, “they would
presumably be immune from elimination as a constitutional right at the
hands of the state polity that sowed the seed of the federal right.”<a
href="#fn1267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1267"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1267</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, it could be acknowledged that, because positive
Ninth Amendment rights:</p>
<p>… have their origin in state constitutions, the substance of federal
positive Ninth Amendment rights varies with the differing state
constitutions. On this view, Ninth Amendment decisional law would
develop a richly variegated pattern. A federal Ninth Amendment right of
privacy would be recognized with respect to Californians and Alaskans,
for example, because both states explicitly recognize such a right. In
contrast, Missouri does not recognize that right. As a result, the
citizens of each state would be uniquely and separately entitled to
define the nature of their relationship with all of their governmental
agents. They would be able to do this immediately (with the state via
the state constitution) and … mediately (with the national government
via the Ninth Amendment’s incorporation of state constitutional
guarantees).<a href="#fn1268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1268"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1268</sup></a></p>
<p>Although this state-specific concept of positive Ninth Amendment
rights would effectively result in a different federal constitutional
law (with respect to the content of such rights) for each of the fifty
states, Massey quite correctly points out that such a scheme is similar
to the current federal practice, under <em>Erie Railroad Co. v.
Tompkins</em>,<a href="#fn1269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1269"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1269</sup></a> by which the federal courts in
diversity cases follow the law of the appropriate state.<a
href="#fn1270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1270"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1270</sup></a> Further, under the state-specific
concept of positive Ninth Amendment rights, unlike under the uniform
national concept, a state could eliminate a positive Ninth Amendment
right by eradicating it from its own constitution (although the reason
for this difference in treatment is unclear).<a href="#fn1271"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1271"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1271</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the most serious disadvantages of the national concept of
positive Ninth Amendment rights, Massey points out, is the Fourteenth
Amendment and the incorporation doctrine. The Bill of Rights, when
enacted in 1791, was intended to bind only the federal government, not
the states.<a href="#fn1272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1272"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1272</sup></a> Under the incorporation doctrine,
most of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights have been held to be
applicable to the states by reading them into the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Although it is unclear whether unenumerated
rights applicable against the federal government through the Ninth
Amendment would be applied against states via the incorporation
doctrine, it is possible, and even likely, at least under the national
conception of positive Ninth Amendment rights.<a href="#fn1273"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1273"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1273</sup></a> This would mean that positive
Ninth Amendment rights would be applied against states by the federal
government. In the state-specific conception of positive Ninth Amendment
rights, this would amount to the federal government’s forcing the state
to abide by its own law. Massey sees little problem with this, since
“[s]urely, a requirement that a government abide by its own law is the
essence of due process.”<a href="#fn1274" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1274" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1274</sup></a> (So formulated,
Massey’s conception of due process is bizarre, and the “surely” here is
surely misplaced. I fail to see how abrogating federalism and
transforming the states from sovereign entities into mere administrative
units of the federal government has anything to do with due
process.)</p>
<p>Under the national conception, Massey notes, incorporating positive
Ninth Amendment rights into the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process
Clause would be likely, and would result in the constitutional rights of
one state being used to override contrary rights in other states.<a
href="#fn1275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1275"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1275</sup></a> For example, suppose Louisiana
provides for a constitutional right of the fetus to life, while most
other states provide for a constitutional right to abortion. Further
suppose that the Supreme Court decides that the right to abortion is a
positive Ninth Amendment right.<a href="#fn1276" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1276" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1276</sup></a> In this case, the
local decision of some states with respect to the abortion issue would
be used to trump the decisions of other states. For this reason, “[t]he
incorporation problem would be experienced most acutely if a national
concept of positive Ninth Amendmentrights were adopted. The
state-specific concept … avoids these problems.”<a href="#fn1277"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1277"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1277</sup></a> In the end, after much
vacillating and consideration of the myriad and complicated pros and
cons of each of the national and state-specific concepts of positive
Ninth Amendment rights, Massey tentatively comes down in favor of the
state-specific conception.<a href="#fn1278" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1278" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1278</sup></a></p>
<p>Before further assessing the merits of Massey’s theory, I first turn
to Massey’s discussion, in chapter 6, of natural Ninth Amendment
rights.<a href="#fn1279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1279"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1279</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="v.-natural-ninth-amendment-rights">V. NATURAL NINTH AMENDMENT
RIGHTS</h4>
<p>After the extensive discussion in chapter 5 concerning positive Ninth
Amendment rights, Massey argues in chapter 6 that the Ninth Amendment
should also be read to include natural rights, rights that are
“prepolitical retained rights.”<a href="#fn1280" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1280" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1280</sup></a> (Although Massey
asserts, inexplicably and without support, that “the fact is that there
is probably no such thing.”<a href="#fn1281" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1281" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1281</sup></a>) As in his theory
of positive Ninth Amendment rights, Massey’s theory of natural Ninth
Amendment rights also bears some innovative features.</p>
<p>Massey begins by noting that we should not “expunge natural law from
the Constitution”;<a href="#fn1282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1282"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1282</sup></a> however, the attempt to inject
natural law into constitutional adjudication must be tempered by the
realization that “[n]atural law cannot be forced on an unwilling and
disbelieving community.”<a href="#fn1283" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1283" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1283</sup></a> Also, natural
Ninth Amendment rights are difficult to determine, and judges and
legislators are inherently fallible “as the prophets of natural Ninth
Amendment rights.”<a href="#fn1284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1284"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1284</sup></a> Thus, there should be a role for
natural Ninth Amendment rights, but they should given only “contingent”
status, so as to provide “an iterative dialogue between the courts and
legislatures whenever the subject is the content or scope of natural
Ninth Amendment rights.”<a href="#fn1285" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1285</sup></a> This iterative
dialogue is meant to ensure that there is “a sufficiently widely shared
cultural understanding to support recognition”<a href="#fn1286"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1286"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1286</sup></a> of an asserted natural right.</p>
<p>Massey notes that there are several devices to accomplish this
dialogue and to make sure that any declared natural Ninth Amendment
rights are merely contingent. For example, in recognizing any
naturalNinth Amendment right, the Supreme Court could make it clear that
its decision is provisional and subject to congressional override.<a
href="#fn1287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1287"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1287</sup></a> Alternatively, the Court could
weaken its usual rule of stare decisis with respect to natural Ninth
Amendment rights so that it is free “to change its mind if it realizes
that its earlier recognition of a natural Ninth Amendment right was
inappropriate.”<a href="#fn1288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1288"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1288</sup></a></p>
<p>As for identifying an asserted right in the first place as a natural
Ninth Amendment right, Massey provides various methods that a court
could use to make this decision. First, natural rights can be identified
from the nature of rights already guaranteed (e.g., locating the right
to privacy in the penumbra of other enumerated rights).<a href="#fn1289"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1289"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1289</sup></a> Second, a presumption of validity
can be given to any asserted right that is consistent with rights
enumerated in the Constitution.<a href="#fn1290" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1290" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1290</sup></a> The right would be
recognized unless the government could overcome the presumption.<a
href="#fn1291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1291"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1291</sup></a> Finally, to recognize a natural
Ninth Amendment right, “[i]n addition to demanding consistency with
enumerated rights and some logical nexus with the themes that inform the
enumerated rights, we might also require that any claimed natural Ninth
Amendment right be consistent with our dynamic history and
traditions.”<a href="#fn1292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1292"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1292</sup></a></p>
<p>Whereas Massey is not quite sure whether state-specific positive
Ninth Amendment rights would be applicable to the states via the
incorporation doctrine,<a href="#fn1293" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1293" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1293</sup></a> he is not so
hesitant regarding natural Ninth Amendment rights.<a href="#fn1294"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1294"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1294</sup></a> Since natural rights are
“prepolitical entitlements,” they are necessarily “fundamental” in the
sense relevant to the Fourteenth Amendment.<a href="#fn1295"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1295"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1295</sup></a> Thus, any recognized natural
Ninth Amendment rights presumably would be applicable against the states
by the incorporation doctrine, since the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment is seen as incorporating rights of sufficient
fundamentality.<a href="#fn1296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1296"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1296</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="vi.-masseys-ninth-amendment">VI. MASSEY’S NINTH AMENDMENT</h4>
<p>I have mentioned above some problems with Massey’s constitutional cy
pres theory.<a href="#fn1297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1297"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1297</sup></a> At this point, it is appropriate
to address further weaknesses in Massey’s theory. Most seriously,
Massey’s argument that the Ninth Amendment actually <em>does</em>
incorporate state-sourced rights is unconvincing.<a href="#fn1298"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1298"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1298</sup></a> The contention seems to be pulled
out of thin air, not rooted in the text or history of the Constitution.
The Ninth Amendment does not <em>state</em> this, for example, and even
if it were understood in 1791 to protect the set of natural rights, some
of which happened to also be enumerated at the time in state
constitutions, there is no reason to think that <em>new</em> positive
rights <em>subsequently</em> added to various state constitutions were
to be included in the original set of natural rights contemplated by the
Ninth Amendment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regardless of the merits of Massey’s reasoning in
support of the thesis that the Ninth Amendment protects state-sourced
unenumerated rights, it is not clear how this reasoning is strengthened
by appeal to the constitutional cy pres doctrine.<a href="#fn1299"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1299"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1299</sup></a> Both his theories of natural and
positive Ninth Amendment rights seem to be supported by quite
respectable (though ultimately unpersuasive) reasoning that is
independent of cy pres-type reasoning. Indeed, Massey’s constitutional
cy pres doctrine seems to be more of an afterthought, a sophisticated
justification or overarching framework added after the fact—to his
original insight that the Ninth Amendment might be read to directly
incorporate state-sourced rights.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if we accept Massey’s contention that the Ninth
Amendment ought to incorporate state-sourced rights, why would this
include only rights explicitly enumerated in state constitutions? As in
the federal system, some rights might be protected by the states in
other ways—by decisions of their state supreme courts, by legislation,
by common law, or even by mere state practice.<a href="#fn1300"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1300"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1300</sup></a> In Louisiana, for example, a
civil-law jurisdiction,<a href="#fn1301" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1301" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1301</sup></a> its Civil Code,
according to the civilian tradition, is treated more like a constitution
than like mere legislation.<a href="#fn1302" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1302" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1302</sup></a> Massey’s focus on
state constitutions does avoid the seemingly insurmountable problems
that his theory would face if all of these potential state sources of
rights were to be considered, but the focus seems arbitrary,
nonetheless.</p>
<p>Massey’s theory is also worrisome because it gives natural rights
relatively short shrift in comparison to positive rights; Massey’s
discussion of the latter is much longer than the former.<a
href="#fn1303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1303"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1303</sup></a> Also, unlike positive Ninth
Amendment rights, which would presumably be very large in number due to
the potentially unlimited number of rights provided in state
constitutions, Massey’s natural Ninth Amendment rights would likely be
very few in number.<a href="#fn1304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1304"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1304</sup></a> Natural Ninth Amendment rights
are granted reluctantly, and have only contingent status.<a
href="#fn1305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1305"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1305</sup></a> Massey does not similarly insist
that the Court’s recognition of <em>positive</em> Ninth Amendment rights
be merely contingent. Further, Massey provides no method for resolving
conflicts between incompatible natural and positive Ninth Amendment
rights, and, indeed, does not even allude to the possibility of such a
conflict. This is inexplicable, given Massey’s extended discussions of
how to resolve potential incompatibilities between Ninth Amendment
rights and other (federal) constitutional rights.<a href="#fn1306"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1306"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1306</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider, for example, the following conflict between natural and
positive rights. Assume that the original understanding of Ninth
Amendment rights is largely consistent with the libertarian conception
of rights as being strictly negative rights, that is, rights against
aggression, the initiation of force.<a href="#fn1307"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1307"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1307</sup></a> In this case, one could very well
argue that there is a natural Ninth Amendment right against having one’s
property forcibly taken by the government and redistributed as welfare
benefits to others. Now suppose that California enshrines various
welfare rights in its constitution—a right to education, to housing, to
a minimum income,and the like (in contravention to natural law). Under
Massey’s doctrine of positive Ninth Amendment rights, this could also
result in a <em>federal</em> Ninth Amendment right to these things, at
least for California citizens. This would be a disastrous result, if
only because an illegitimate conception of rights, formerly localized to
California—and such localization of policy is one of the benefits of
federalism—is now imposed on the federal government.</p>
<p>Even worse, under the national concept of positive Ninth Amendment
rights, the federal government (acting through its agent, the Supreme
Court) could adopt this welfare right as a positive Ninth Amendment
right of national scope, and force <em>all</em> the states to provide
education and welfare rights, an even worse attack on the principle of
federalism and an illegitimate result to boot (since there are, in
truth, no such welfare rights). The only possible saving grace to this
situation would be if the courts were to find that the natural Ninth
Amendment right to not have one’s property expropriated and
redistributed to others somehow outweighed the positive Ninth Amendment
welfare right. But Massey does not address how such potential conflicts
between natural and positive Ninth Amendment rights would be resolved;
in any event, it is contrary to principles of federalism to allow the
federal government to resolve such conflicts. Additionally, lest it be
thought that my interpretation that Massey’s theory would yield positive
rights is paranoid, it should be noted that Massey himself explicitly
states that the Ninth Amendment, when interpreted under today’s
conceptions of rights, might require non-negative rights such as welfare
rights.<a href="#fn1308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1308"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1308</sup></a></p>
<p>In my view, if the Ninth Amendment is to be judicially enforceable,
it is unnecessary to use a cy pres-type theory or to include
positiverights in the Ninth Amendment. Rather, it ought to be recognized
that the Ninth Amendment essentially protects unenumerated natural
rights as long as the natural rights can be identified with sufficient
certainty. By now, this reading of the Ninth Amendment has been
adequately established.<a href="#fn1309" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1309" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1309</sup></a> For example, as
Randy Barnett has pointed out, even if the Framers’ view of natural
rights was incorrect—even if there are no natural rights—it is relevant
that the <em>Framers</em> believed in natural rights and embodied a
certain conception of these rights in the Constitution. Thus, anyone who
“allow[s] a role for [the] Framers’ intent” and who “view[s] the
Constitution as a kind of contract entered into at the time of
ratification” should “make some effort to discern and protect at least
the kinds of rights the Framers had in mind when they ratified the Ninth
Amendment.”<a href="#fn1310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1310"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1310</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>identifying</em> what these rights are, the various techniques
proposed by Massey, Barnett, and others are useful. It seems reasonable
that one way to discover the content of the natural rights included
within the scope of the Ninth Amendment would be to examine the rights
guaranteed by state constitutions, especially since, as Massey points
out, protection of natural rights was to be left primarily to the
states.<a href="#fn1311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1311"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1311</sup></a> However, in this view,
state-sourced rights are merely <em>evidence</em> of which natural
rights are protected by the Ninth Amendment. Whether these rights are
dynamic and ever-evolving and growing, as Massey maintains,<a
href="#fn1312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1312"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1312</sup></a> or static is another question,
but I am unconvinced<br />
by Massey’s argument that both positive and natural Ninth Amendment
rights should be envisioned as changing with the times. It is a written
constitution that we are interpreting, after all.</p>
<p>Further, given that the modern conception of rights and legitimate
state power is thoroughly statist, the Framers’ conception of rights is
vastly preferable, at least for anyone who favors individual rights. For
example, as mentioned above, the dynamic view of unenumerated rights
might result in the cross-pollination and thus spreading of
(illegitimate) welfare-type rights.<a href="#fn1313"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1313"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1313</sup></a> Interpreting the Constitution in
accordance with its original, that is, static, understanding is
therefore preferable to reading socialist rights into it, as it is a
more honest interpretation and also more likely to be in accord with
individual rights.</p>
<p>Finally, there is another serious weakness in Massey’s theory. As
Massey readily acknowledges, one of the original purposes of the
Constitution was federalism, the sovereignty of each state.<a
href="#fn1314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1314"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1314</sup></a> Indeed, one of Massey’s reasons
to support constitutional cy pres and positive Ninth Amendment rights is
to help limit the powers (though indirectly, by trumping these powers
with Ninth Amendment rights) that the federal government has
illegitimately usurped over the years.<a href="#fn1315"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1315"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1315</sup></a> Yet there can be little doubt
that, in this age of an untrustworthy federal government and Supreme
Court, expanding the Court’s jurisdiction to declare rights would result
in the further weakening of federalism.<a href="#fn1316"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1316"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1316</sup></a></p>
<p>Massey admits that Ninth Amendment rights would likely be applied to
the states by the incorporation doctrine.<a href="#fn1317"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1317"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1317</sup></a> But the incorporation doctrine is
one reason why Massey’s theory should be rejected, for as long as that
is in place, further federal judicial activism only imperils our rights,
leading to further erosion of federalism by making state policy subject
to federal control. One would think that Massey, since he is obviously
willing to urge an innovative interpretation of the Ninth Amendment,
would have used his constitutional cy pres doctrine, or at least
ordinary reasoning, to build a rejection of the incorporation doctrine
into his theory. Federalism, in the American constitutional system, is
essential to the protection of individual rights, both enumerated and
unenumerated ones.<a href="#fn1318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1318"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1318</sup></a> The greatest violator of
individual rights, even if measured by such a simple parameter as the
overall level of taxation, is the federal leviathan; in comparison, the
states are minarchist utopias. Although Massey’s proposal is intended to
increase the protection of individual rights, it involves ceding more
power to the federal government to control and oversee the states and to
define what rights are to apply at which level of government.<a
href="#fn1319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1319"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1319</sup></a> As Ludwig von Mises wisely
observed in a related context, “No socialist author ever gave a thought
to the possibility that the abstract entity which he wants to vest with
unlimited power—whether it is called humanity, society, nation, state,
or government—could act in a way of which he himself disapproves.”<a
href="#fn1320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1320"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1320</sup></a> In other words, the central
government cannot be trusted to safely exercise any extra power that is
given to it, even if the purpose of the power is ostensibly to protect
rights. Accordingly, as Paul Conkin has noted, “Ironically, the
tremendous expansion of federal power in all areas, including the
expanded role in protecting individual rights, has finally transformed
the often fantastic eighteenth-century fears of a federal leviathan into
prophetic admonitions.”<a href="#fn1321" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1321" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1321</sup></a> Handing more
powerto the federal government, as Massey’s theory unfortunately does,
would ill-serve the original understanding and purpose of the Ninth
Amendment.</p>
<p>Unlike the Supreme Court, most modern constitutional scholars, and
other intellectuals, Massey takes the Ninth Amendment seriously. He has
written a provocative study of the Ninth Amendment, but, due to the
problems with Massey’s thesis detailed above, I believe a better
approach to the Ninth Amendment may be found in the writings of other
scholars, such as Randy Barnett<a href="#fn1322" class="footnote-ref"

CONCLUSION: CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION OR POLITICAL THEORY?</h4>
<p>If Massey is correct that it is too late to limit the federal
government to its proper powers, it is unlikely that the Court will try
to, or even want to, accomplish the same thing by trumping those powers
with Ninth Amendment rights. The truth is, and I doubt Massey would
demur, that Massey’s theory stands no realistic chance of being adopted
by the Supreme Court. Most likely, from the Court’s point of view, it is
too radical, too academic, and at least has the potential of imposing
some limits on federal power. So Massey’s theory is not <em>really</em>
a theory of how the Constitution should be interpreted. What, then, is
it? In truth, it is a proposal to amend the Constitution.</p>
<p>There are, however, better and simpler alternatives
available—alternatives that strengthen, rather than weaken, federalism.
One such alternative is that of Marshall DeRosa, as explained in his
recent book <em>The Ninth Amendment and the Politics of Creative
Jurisprudence</em>.<a href="#fn1324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1324"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1324</sup></a> DeRosa proposes an ingenious
constitutional amendment, which would read as follows:</p>
<p>When a national majority of each State’s chief judicial official
declares a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to be inconsistent with
the U.S. Constitution, the said decision shall thereby be negated and
precedent restored. The States’ designated chief judicial officers shall
convey their declarations to the U.S. Solicitor General, who in turn
will notify the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to take
appropriate measures consistent with this amendment.<a href="#fn1325"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1325"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1325</sup></a></p>
<p>As DeRosa explains, this would allow controversial Supreme Court
decisions to be overturned “more expeditiously and competently” than at
present.<a href="#fn1326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1326"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1326</sup></a> The states would not have to
“resort[] to a cumbersome amendment process or the national congress
that is significantly detached from states’ interests.”<a href="#fn1327"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1327"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1327</sup></a> Also, the amendment would have a
chilling effect on the Supreme Court, making it more reluctant to issue
unreasoned or unconstitutional decisions,<a href="#fn1328"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1328"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1328</sup></a> just as lower courts are
reluctant to issue decisions that may be overturned by higher courts. In
essence, this amendment would “heighten popular control over
unenumerated rights jurisprudence, and to that extent a significant
portion of originalism would be recovered.”<a href="#fn1329"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1329"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1329</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="i.-introduction-4">I. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>If Professor Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s books and articles would come
already-underlined and highlighted, it would save readers a lot of time.
Or at least each book should come with a free pen attached. For when I
follow my usual habit of underlining, circling, checking, starring, or
highlighting important insights in the books I read, I find that my
copies of Hoppe’s books start to look as if a two-year-old with a crayon
had gotten hold of them.</p>
<p>In 1989, Hoppe published <em>A Theory of Socialism and
Capitalism</em>, in my eyes one of the most important books of the
decade for its analysis of capitalism, socialism, and property rights,
focus on scarcity in property and economic theory, and its revolutionary
“argumentation ethic” defense of individual rights.<a href="#fn1335"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1335"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1335</sup></a> Over the past few years, Hoppe
has produced a significant assortment of articles elaborating on his
argumentation ethic and the epistemology that underlies it, as well as
on his impressive economic writings. His new book, <em>The Economics and
Ethics of Private Property</em>, is a collection of almost all of these
related writings (not counting a large number of writings published
previously in German). This may come as a disappointment to some, who,
like me, were expecting a new treatise, building upon the prior one. The
book is significant, nonetheless, for drawing together material
previously published in such varied sources as <em>Liberty</em>
magazine, the <em>Journal of Libertarian Studies</em>, the <em>Review of
Austrian Economics</em>, <em>Ratio</em>, and others.<a href="#fn1336"

<h4 id="ii.-individual-rights">II. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</h4>
<h5 id="a.-the-reception-of-hoppes-ideas"><em>A. The Reception of
Hoppe’s Ideas</em></h5>
<p>This book is fascinating, stimulating, provocative, and
ground-breaking. In the September 1988 issue of <em>Liberty</em>, Hoppe
published “The Ultimate Justification of the Private Property Ethic.”
This article gave rise to a symposium, “Breakthrough or Buncombe?”,
published in the November 1988 issue of <em>Liberty</em>, containing the
critical comments of ten commentators, including Murray Rothbard, Tibor
Machan, David Friedman, Leland Yeager, David Gordon, Douglas Rasmussen,
David Ramsay Steele, Timothy Virkkala, and others.</p>
<p>To my surprise, almost all of these libertarian commentators were
unimpressed by, if not downright hostile to, Hoppe’s argument. Only
Murray Rothbard gave Hoppe’s thesis wholehearted endorsement and
recognized its validity and significance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and
for libertarianism in particular, he has managed to transcend the famous
is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the
days of the scholastics, and that had brought modern libertarianism into
a tiresome deadlock. Not only that: Hans Hoppe has managed to establish
the case for anarcho-capitalist-Lockean rights in an unprecedentedly
hard-core manner, one that makes my own natural law/natural rights
position seem almost wimpy in comparison.<a href="#fn1337"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1337"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1337</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why Hoppe’s ideas, which are such an important advance in political
and libertarian thought, have failed to cause more excitement or gain
more adherents than they have is baffling, but the best solution to this
is the publication of further elaborations and defenses contained in
Hoppe’s newest book.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts, “Economics” and “Philosophy.”
Because <em>Part Two: Philosophy</em> contains Hoppe’s most important
ideas—his defense of individual rights—I will discuss this part first.
The six chapters (chapters 6 through 11) in Part Two plus the “Four
Critical Replies” in the Appendix present Hoppe’s argumentation ethic
and its underlying epistemology—often repeatedly and redundantly,
because the chapters were first published as independent papers, and
little editing, except in chapter 6, has been done to integrate them or
to delete redundancies.</p>
<h5 id="b.-argumentation-ethics"><em>B. Argumentation Ethics</em></h5>
<p>Hoppe’s “argumentation ethics” theory, briefly stated, starts by
noting that all truths, including ethics and normative statements, must
be discoverable through the process of argumentation. This “a priori of
communication and argumentation” is undeniable, as one would have to
contradict oneself in using argument to deny this. Therefore, whatever
facts or norms are postulated while engaging in argumentation cannot be
contradicted by any proposed fact or norms.<a href="#fn1338"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1338"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1338</sup></a> As Hoppe writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In analyzing any actual norm proposal reason’s task is merely
confined to analyzing whether or not it is logically consistent with the
very ethics which the proponent must presuppose as valid insofar as he
is able to make his proposal at all.<a href="#fn1339"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1339"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1339</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In argumentation, the validity of certain implications cannot be
disputed. For example, the universalization principle, as formulated in
the Golden Rule of ethics or in the Kantian Categorical Imperative,
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… that only those norms can be justified that can be formulated as
general principles which without exception are valid for everyone.
Indeed, as it is implied in argumentation that everyone who can
understand an argument must in principle be able to be convinced by it
simply because of its argumentative force, the universalization
principle of ethics can now be understood and explained in the wider a
priori of communication and argumentation.<a href="#fn1340"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1340"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1340</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, anyone who argues accepts the validity of the
universalization principle implicitly.</p>
<p>“The universalization principle only provides one with a <em>purely
formal</em> criterion for morality…. However, there are <em>other
positive norms</em> implied in argumentation apart from” this
principle.<a href="#fn1341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1341"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1341</sup></a> First Hoppe points out three
interrelated facts: “First, that argumentation is not only a cognitive
but a practical affair. Second, that argumentation, as a form of action,
implies the use of the scarce resource of one’s body. And third, that
argumentation is a conflict-free way of interacting.”<a href="#fn1342"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1342"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1342</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore, anyone engaging in argumentation (or, indeed, any
discourse at all, even with oneself) must accept the presupposed right
of self-ownership of all listeners and even potential listeners: for
otherwise the listener would not be able to consider freely and accept
or reject the proposed argument, which is undeniably a goal of
argumentation. “It is only as long as there is at least an implicit
recognition of each individual’s property right in his or her own body
that argumentation can take place.”<a href="#fn1343"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1343"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1343</sup></a> The libertarian nonaggression
principle—“nobody has the right to uninvitedly aggress against the body
of any other person and thus delimit or restrict anyone’s control over
his own body”—is implied in the concept of argumentative justification,
because justifying <em>means</em> justifying without having to rely on
coercion.</p>
<p>The concomitant right to homestead private property is also
presupposed by anyone engaging in argumentation: since the use of
naturalresources, i.e., property rights in land, food, water, etc., is
absolutely necessary for any listener to survive and be able to
participate in an argument,and since homesteading unowned property is
the only objective and conflict-free way to assign property rights, all
arguers must also presuppose the validity of the homesteading of unowned
property, the Lockean “mixing of labor” with scarce resources, for
otherwise argumentation<br />
could not occur.<a href="#fn1344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1344"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1344</sup></a> And, of course, the right to
self-ownership plus the right to homestead are the bases of
laissez-faire capitalism.<a href="#fn1345" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1345" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1345</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="c.-estoppel-and-directions-for-further-inquiry"><em>C. Estoppel
and Directions for Further Inquiry</em></h5>
<p>Professor Hoppe’s discovery of such a rock-solid defense of
individual rights is a profoundly important achievement. Because so many
of Hoppe’s insights deserve further exploration and development, one
welcomes future writing by Hoppe and by others building upon his work.<a
href="#fn1346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1346"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1346</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, in my own article, “Estoppel: A New Justification for
Individual Rights,”<a href="#fn1347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1347"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1347</sup></a> I draw on Hoppe’s work—especially
his application of the principle of universalizability to the activity
of argumentation—in making another argumentation-based or
discourse-based defense of individual rights. Hoppe’s main argument is
that any person who argues must accept certain principles that must be
implicitly acknowledged by any person engaged in the very activity of
arguing, and that these principles imply the rights of self-ownership
and homesteading, as they are incompatible with any
other—“socialist”—ethic. In my estoppel theory, I argue that the
existence of rights can be demonstrated by looking at the consistency of
the arguments made by a rights violator at the moment when he is about
to be punished for the rights violation.</p>
<p>Since what is important about rights is that they are (legitimately)
<em>enforceable</em>, if an alleged rights-violator is unable to
meaningfully object to his punishment or, indeed, if he implicitly
consents to his punishment, then this is enough to justify the existence
of the rights claimed. And it is indeed true that if <em>A</em>
initiates violence against <em>B</em>, <em>A</em> is estopped, or
prevented, from complaining (i.e., objecting or withholding consent) if
<em>B</em> retaliates or punishes <em>A</em>. For <em>A</em> has
admitted the validity of aggression, and it would be inconsistent for
him to object to his own punishment, which is, after all, “only”
aggression.</p>
<p>By the same token, however, laws that attempt to enforce “positive”
rights (such as the right to food or a job) or to prohibit nonaggressive
behavior (such as expression, prostitution, the use of drugs, or the
offer to pay someone less than minimum wage) are not legitimate. For
here the state, in enforcing such laws against nonaggressors, is itself
an aggressor.<a href="#fn1348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1348"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1348</sup></a> If the imprisoned, nonaggressive
“criminal” asserts his <em>right</em> to be freed and his concomitant
right to use force against the aggressor-state to escape, the state
cannot deny this asserted right nor the legitimacy of the prisoner’s
(proposed) use of force against the state, since the state, by being an
aggressor, is estopped from denying the legitimacy of the use of force.
Since the prisoner has a right to be freed, of course the state has no
contrary “right” to imprison him. By this same logic, an aggressive
criminal has a right to not be <em>disproportionately</em> punished. For
example, someone who steals an ink pen may not be executed as
punishment.<a href="#fn1349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1349"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1349</sup></a></p>
<p>It is hoped that others will also build upon or critique Hoppe’s
work. Murray Rothbard stated in the <em>Liberty</em> symposium that “a
future research program for Hoppe and other libertarian philosophers
would be (a) to see how far axiomatics can be extended into other
spheres of ethics, or (b) to see if and how this axiomatic could be
integrated into the standard natural law approach.”<a href="#fn1350"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1350"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1350</sup></a> Also of interest would be a
systematic cataloguing of just what is a priori axiomatic knowledge.<a
href="#fn1351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1351"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1351</sup></a></p>
<p>Another tantalizing idea deserving further exploration is Hoppe’s
discussion of free will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]ne must regard one’s knowledge and actions as uncaused. One might
hold this conception of “freedom” to be an illusion, and from the point
of view of a “scientist” with cognitive powers substantially superior to
any human intelligence, from the point of view of God, for example, such
a description may well be correct—but we are not God, and even if
freedom is illusory from His standpoint, for we [sic] human beings it is
a necessary illusion.<a href="#fn1352" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1352" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1352</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h5
id="d.-remaining-questionsrights-of-fetuses-babies-and-defective-humans"><em>D.
Remaining Questions—Rights of Fetuses, Babies, and Defective
Humans</em></h5>
<p>Hoppe establishes the foundation for individual rights, but takes it
no further. One almost salivates at the prospect of Hoppe writing more
on this, answering the questions of exactly how to apply the rights of
self-ownership and homesteading to the hard cases, such as fetuses,
babies, children, and retarded people (who, after all, cannot argue).
Hoppe deals only suggestively or obliquely with this problem: the
question of what is just or unjust “does not arise vis-à-vis a stone or
fish, because they are incapable of engaging in such exchanges and of
producing validity-claiming propositions.”<a href="#fn1353"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1353"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1353</sup></a></p>
<p>What about fetuses, or even babies? Another related statement of
Hoppe’s fails to answer this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, we could have conflicts regarding the use of scarce
resources with, let us say, an elephant or a mosquito, yet we would not
consider it possible to resolve these conflicts by means of proposing
property norms. The avoidance of possible conflicts, in such cases, is
merely a technological, not an ethical, problem. For it to turn into an
ethical problem, it is also necessary that the conflicting actors be
capable, in principle, of argumentation.<a href="#fn1354"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1354"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1354</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is a baby “in principle” capable of argumentation? Hoppe’s view on
this is unfortunately unrevealed.</p>
<h5
id="e.-hoppe-rothbard-rand-and-classical-natural-rights-theory"><em>E.
Hoppe, Rothbard, Rand, and Classical Natural Rights Theory</em></h5>
<p>Hoppe never commits himself as to whether he believes other defenders
of natural rights—such as Rothbard, whom Hoppe obviously admires
greatly—are correct in their support of natural law and natural rights.
He remains noncommittal, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agreeing with Rothbard on the possibility of a rational ethic and,
more specifically, on the fact that only a libertarian ethic can indeed
be morally justified, I want to propose here a different,
non-natural-rights approach to establishing these two related claims. It
has been a common quarrel with the natural rights position, even by
sympathetic readers, that the concept of human nature is far “too
diffuse and varied to provide a determinate set of contents of natural
law.”<a href="#fn1355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1355"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1355</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Hoppe agree that natural law is hogwash? Is he a “sympathetic
reader”? One gets the impression that he agrees with this criticism of
natural law. If so, however, it is unclear how Rothbard, aligning
himself with the natural law or natural rights tradition of philosophy,
in “<em>The Ethics of Liberty</em> presents the full case [that] the
libertarian property<br />
norms” are the rules that “can be discerned by means of reason as
grounded in the very nature of man.”<a href="#fn1356"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1356"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1356</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoppe even attempts to define his own theory as being, really, a new
type of natural rights theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor, then, do I claim that it is impossible to interpret my approach
as falling in a “rightly conceived” natural rights tradition after all….
What is claimed, though, is that the following approach is clearly out
of line with what the natural rights approach has actually come to be,
and that it owes nothing to this tradition as it stands…. Of course,
then, since the capability of argumentation is an essential part of
human nature—one could not even say anything about the latter without
the former—it could also be argued that norms which cannot be defended
effectively in the course of argumentation are also incompatible with
human nature.<a href="#fn1357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1357"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1357</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, Hoppe states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his defense of private property is essentially also Rothbard’s. In
spite of his formal allegiance to the natural rights tradition Rothbard,
in what I consider his most crucial argument in defense of a private
property ethic, not only chooses essentially the same starting
point—argumentation—but also gives a justification by means of a priori
reasoning almost identical to the one just developed. To prove the point
I can do no better than simply quote: “Now, <em>any</em> person
participating in any sort of discussion, including one on values, is, by
virtue of so participating, alive and affirming life. For if he were
<em>really</em> opposed to life he would have no business continuing to
be alive. Hence, the <em>supposed</em> opponent of life is really
affirming it in the very process of discussion, and hence the
preservation and furtherance of one’s life takes on the stature of an
incontestable axiom.”<a href="#fn1358" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1358</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="f.-hoppes-value-free-ethics"><em>F. Hoppe’s Value-Free (?)
Ethics</em></h5>
<p>In addition to Hoppe’s seeming unwillingness to criticize
wholeheartedly the natural rights tradition, he is also curiously
reluctant to admit the ethical aspects of his argumentation ethic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here the praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of
offering a completely value-free justification of private property. It
remains entirely in the realm of is-statements, and nowhere tries to
derive an ought from an is. The structure of the argument is this: (a)
justification is propositional justification—a priori true is-statement;
(b) argumentation presupposes property in one’s body and the
homesteading principle—a priori true is-statement; and (c) then, no
deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified—a priori true
is-statement.<a href="#fn1359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1359"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1359</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I do not see how this is a “completely value-free justification
of private property.” Private property means <em>rights</em> in private
property; and “rights” is indeed a normative, value-laden concept. Of
course, in a trivial sense, any statement such as “<em>A</em> should do
X” is an is-statement, because one is implicitly stating that “it is the
case that <em>A</em> should do X.” But this is still really an
ought-statement, as is step (b) above, in making a statement about
property rights. I do not see, however, why Hoppe is reluctant to admit
this, as this is not a defect of his argument, but is in fact why it is
so powerful—because it <em>does</em> justify the subset of ethics
concerning rights.</p>
<h5 id="g.-hoppes-conception-of-rights"><em>G. Hoppe’s Conception of
“Rights”</em></h5>
<p>Unfortunately, Hoppe never clearly defines what he means by “rights,”
which leads to some slight confusion in the presentation of aspects of
his argument.<a href="#fn1360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1360"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1360</sup></a> Primarily, he uses the word in a
normative, ethical sense. He occasionally, however, seems to mean
“power,” which is value-neutral and non-normative: “[I]f no one had the
right to acquire and control anything except his own body … then we
would all cease to exist….”<a href="#fn1361" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1361</sup></a> It is true that we
would all cease to exist if we had no power or ability to acquire and
control things; however, a “right” is not logically necessary for this
power to be exercised. For example, in a Robinsonade, Crusoe alone on
his desert island has no rights because rights are relevant only
socially, as they concern relationships between individuals. Yet Crusoe,
if he has the power to build a hut and gather fruit, can actually
survive.</p>
<p>Certainly we have the ability to affect the world, otherwise we would
not continue to exist—and this may explain <em>why</em>, according to
Hoppe’s theory, we must have the <em>right</em> to exercise this
ability. But the problem with switching to the power-sense of “rights”
in a justification of normative-rights is that one may end up justifying
the former and not the latter, or neither. And certainly it would be
both useless and futile to try to prove that we all have the actual
ability and power to control our bodies and to homestead; the very
existence of the Internal Revenue Service disproves this contention
immediately. Hoppe’s inconsistent use of “rights” is not fatal to his
argument, but clarification of this step in his argument and a precise
definition of “rights” would be welcome.<a href="#fn1362"

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1371"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1371</sup></a> they would not agree with the
next step taken by Hoppe. Hoppe next recognizes that argumentation, as a
form of action, requires exclusive control of the scarce resources in
one’s body; this implies that “as long as there is any argumentation,
there is a mutual recognition of each other’s property right in his own
body.”<a href="#fn1372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1372"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1372</sup></a> As Hoppe observes, “That

complete ignorance of economics, and a corresponding blindness towards
the fact of scarcity.”<a href="#fn1373" class="footnote-ref"

<h5
id="a.-the-application-of-praxeology-to-epistemology-and-ethics"><em>A.
The Application of Praxeology to Epistemology and Ethics</em></h5>
<p>Hoppe’s epistemology is basically an extension of Ludwig von Mises’s
praxeology, which Mises had previously applied only to economics.<a
href="#fn1374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1374"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1374</sup></a> Mises inquired into the logical
status of typical economic propositions such as the law of marginal
utility. Mises showed that both empiricism and historicism are
self-contradictory doctrines and justified the claims of rationalist
philosophy by demonstrating the existence of a priori synthetic
propositions.<a href="#fn1375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1375"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1375</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Kantian and Misesian framework, analytic truths like “all
bachelors are unmarried” are true, but circular or tautological.
Synthetic truths, like “all bachelors are unfulfilled” (if that were
true), say something substantial about bachelors that is not already
part of the definitionof bachelors. We may know a synthetic truth
through experience or empirically (or a posteriori). But these truths
are not <em>necessarily</em> true, and might have been false if
experience had been different. According to empiricism, synthetic truths
can be known only through experience.<a href="#fn1376"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1376"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1376</sup></a> A synthetic a priori proposition
is significant because it is necessarily true yet is not a tautology,
thus yielding certain unchallengeable real knowledge about the world.<a
href="#fn1377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1377"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1377</sup></a></p>
<p>Mises shows that the propositions of economics are indeed knowledge
that is <em>not</em> derived from observation and yet is constrained by
objective laws. In the science of praxeology, the general theory of
human action, the “axiom of action” (i.e., the proposition that humans
act, that they display intentional behavior), qualifies as a priori
synthetic knowledge because (a) the “axiom is not derived from
observation—there are only bodily movements to be observed but no such
thing as actions—but stems instead from reflective understanding”; and
(b) this understanding is of a self-evident proposition, “for its truth
cannot be denied, since the denial would itself have to be categorized
as an action.”<a href="#fn1378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1378"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1378</sup></a> Mises shows that all of the
“categories which we know to be the very heart of economics—values,
ends, means, choice, preference, cost, profit and loss—are implied in
the axiom of action.”<a href="#fn1379" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1379</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoppe’s achievement is to explain how praxeology also provides the
foundation for epistemology and ethics (the argumentation ethichas
already been discussed above). To the a priori axiom of action, Hoppe
adds a second a priori axiom, the “a priori of argumentation.” This
axiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… states that humans are capable of argumentation and hence know the
meaning of truth and validity. As in the case of the action axiom, this
knowledge is not derived from observation: there is only verbal behavior
to be observed and prior reflective cognition is required in order to
interpret such behavior as meaningful arguments. And the validity of the
axiom, like that of the action axiom, is indisputable. It is impossible
to deny that one can argue, as the very denial would itself be an
argument….</p>
<p>Recognizing, as we have just done, that knowledge claims are raised
and decided upon in the course of argumentation and that this is
undeniably so, one can now reconstruct the task of epistemology more
precisely as that of formulating those propositions which are
argumentatively indisputable in that their truth is already implied in
the very fact of making one’s argument and so cannot be denied
argumentatively; and to delineatethe range of such a priori knowledge
from the realm of propositions whose validity cannot be established in
this way but require additional, contingent information for their
validation, or that cannot be validated at all and so are mere
metaphysical statements in the pejorative sense of the term
metaphysical.<a href="#fn1380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1380"

<h5 id="b.-hoppe-and-kant-versus-rand"><em>B. Hoppe and Kant Versus
Rand</em></h5>
<p>Hoppe offers a stunning justification and interpretation of Kant’s
controversial statement that “[so] far it has been assumed that our
knowledge had to conform to reality,” instead it should be assumed ‘that
observational reality should conform to our mind.’“<a href="#fn1381"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1381"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1381</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to rationalist philosophy, a priori true propositions had
their foundation in the operation of principles of thinking which one
could not possibly conceive of as operating otherwise; they were
grounded in categories of an active mind. Now, as empiricists were only
too eager to point out, the obvious critique of such a position is, that
if this were indeed the case, it could not be explained why such mental
categories should fit reality. Rather, one would be forced to accept the
absurd idealistic assumption that reality would have to be conceived of
as a creation of the mind, in order to claim that a priori knowledge
could incorporate any information about the structure of reality.<a
href="#fn1382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1382"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1382</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The empiricists’ critique seemed to be justified by statements such
as that of Kant above. However, writes Hoppe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… recognizing knowledge as being structurally constrained by its role
in the framework of action categories provides the solution to such a
complaint. For as soon as this is realized, all idealistic suggestions
of rationalist philosophy disappear, and an epistemology claiming that a
priori true propositions exist becomes a realistic epistemology instead.
Understood as constrained by action categories, the seemingly
unbridgeable gulf between the mental on the one hand and the real,
outside physical world on the other is bridged. So constrained, a priori
knowledge must be as much a mental thing as a reflection of the
structure of reality, since it is only through actions that the mind
comes into contact with reality, so to speak. Acting is a cognitively
guided adjustment of a physical body in physical reality. And thus,
there can be no doubt that a priori knowledge, conceived of as an
insight into the structural constraints imposed on knowledge qua
knowledge of actors, must indeed correspond to the nature of things. The
realistic character of such knowledge would manifest itself not only in
the fact that one could not <em>think</em> it to be otherwise, but in
the fact that one could not <em>undo</em> its truth.<a href="#fn1383"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1383"

</blockquote>
<p>In Hoppe’s pamphlet <em>Praxeology and Economic Science</em>,<a
href="#fn1384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1384"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1384</sup></a> which contains a discussion
similar to the one in chapter 6 of his book, he makes it clear that he
does not think that Kant himself meant that realityis created by the
mind.<a href="#fn1385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1385"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1385</sup></a> Indeed, Kant had hinted at the
solution presented in Hoppe’s interpretation above. Hoppe writes, “He
thought mathematics, for instance, had to be grounded in our knowledge
of the meaning of repetition, of repetitive operations. And he also
realized, if only somewhat vaguely, that the principle of causality is
implied in our understanding of what it is and means to act.”<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1386</sup></a></p>
<p>As for the Objectivist or Randian denunciation of Kant for this
statement that observational reality should conform to the mind, Hoppe
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among some followers of Austrianism, the Kant interpretation of Ayn
Rand (see, for instance, her <em>Introduction to Objectivist
Epistemology</em> [1979]; or <em>For the New Intellectual</em> [1961])
enjoys great popularity. Her interpretation, replete with sweeping
denunciatory pronouncements, however, is characterized by a complete
absence of any interpretive documentation whatsoever. On Rand’s arrogant
ignorance regarding Kant, see B. Goldberg, “Ayn Rand’s ‘For the New
Intellectual,’” <em>New Individualist Rev.</em>, vol. 1, no. 3 (1961).<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1387</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="c.-a-priori-truths"><em>C. A Priori Truths</em></h5>
<p>Hoppe then ferrets out various truths that are implied in the very
fact of arguing. The laws of logic, such as junctors (“and,” “or,”
“if-then,” “not”), quantors (“there is,” “all,” “some”), and the laws of
identity and contradiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… are a priori true propositions about reality and not mere verbal
stipulations regarding the transformation rules of arbitrarily chosen
signs, as empiricist-formalists would have it. They are as much laws of
thinking as of reality, because they are laws that have their ultimate
foundation in action and could not be undone by any actor. In each and
every action, an actor identifies some specific situation and
categorizes it in one way rather than another in order to be able to
make a choice.<a href="#fn1388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1388"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1388</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe goes on to show that arithmetic is an a priori and yet
empirical discipline and “is rooted in our understanding of
repetition—the repetition of action.”<a href="#fn1389"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1389"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1389</sup></a> He even demonstrates the
irrelevance of Gödel’s Incompleteness theorem.<a href="#fn1390"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1390"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1390</sup></a> Euclidean geometry is a priori
and yet incorporates empirical knowledge about space, “because it is not

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1391</sup></a> Einstein’s non-Euclidean theories

be constructed according to Euclidean principles.”<a href="#fn1392"

<p>Hoppe also demonstrates the a prioristic character of causality and

everything that is an action must be categorized teleogically.”<a

<h5 id="a.-public-goods-theory-and-the-production-of-security"><em>A.
Public Goods Theory and the Production of Security</em></h5>
<p><em>Part One: Economics</em> contains five interesting and insightful
chapters. In chapter 1, “Fallacies of the Public Goods Theory and the
Production of Security,” Hoppe shows that the distinction between
“private” and “public” goods is completely illusory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A clear-cut dichotomy between private and public goods does not
exist…. All goods are more or less private or public and can—and
constantly do—change with respect to their degree of
privateness/publicness as people’s values and evaluations change, and as
changes occur in the composition of the population. In order to
recognize that they never fall, once and for all, into either one or the
other category, one must only recall what makes something a good. For
something to be a good it must be recognized and treated as scarce by
someone. Something is not a good as such, that is to say; goods are
goods only in the eyes of the beholder. Nothing is a good unless at
least one person subjectively evaluates it as such. But then, when goods
are never goods-as-such—when no physico-chemical analysis can identify
something as an economic good—there is clearly no fixed, objective
criterion for classifying goods as either private or public. They can
never be private or public goods as such. Their private or public
character depends on how few or how many people consider them to be
goods, with the degree to which they are private or public changing as
these evaluations change and ranging from one to infinity.<a
href="#fn1395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1395"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1395</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe then applies this analysis to the production of security,
commonly held to be a public good. Because the production of security is
no more a “public good” than goods and services such as cheese, houses,
or insurance, there is no special economic reason that prevents markets
from producing security, and thus no justification to require remedial
state action, such as state monopolization of police and defense.</p>
<h5 id="b.-the-economics-and-sociology-of-taxation"><em>B. The Economics
and Sociology of Taxation</em></h5>
<p>In chapter 2, “The Economics and Sociology of Taxation,” Hoppe argues
that only three ways exist of acquiring or increasing wealth: through
homesteading, producing, or contracting. Since taxation implies a
reduction of income a person can expect to receive from these three
activities, the opportunity cost for using one’s time and body to
perform these activities is raised by taxation. Thus the marginal
utility of producing wealth is decreased, and the marginal utility of
consumption and leisure is increased, leading to a shift away from the
production of wealth and towards consumption and leisure. Therefore
taxation is a means for the destruction of property and
wealth-formation.<a href="#fn1396" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1396"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1396</sup></a></p>
<p>To the objection that taxation makes people actually work
<em>harder</em> in order to earn the same income as before taxation,
Hoppe replies that even if increased taxation causes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… [an] increase in workaholism, it is still the case that the income
of value-productive individuals has fallen. For even if they produce the
same output as previously, they can only do so if they expend more labor
now than before. And since any additional labor expenditure implies
foregone leisure or consumption (leisure or consumption which they
otherwise could have enjoyed along with the same output of valuable
assets), their overall standard of living must be lower now.<a
href="#fn1397" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1397"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1397</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe also explains “why the assumption that taxation can possibly
leave the productive output of valuable assets unaffected and
exclusively cripple consumption is fatally flawed.”<a href="#fn1398"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1398"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1398</sup></a> This is because time
preference—people’s preference of present goods over future
goods—combines with the increased marginal utility of leisure and
consumption and the decreased marginal utility of production. Because
people have an increased preference for consumption (in the present),
and a relatively decreased preference for production (in the future),
the length of the structure of production is shortened, and thus fewer
valuable future assets are produced. “Every act of taxation necessarily
exerts a push away from more highly capitalized, and hence more
productive production processes, and into the direction of a
hand-to-mouth existence.”<a href="#fn1399" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1399" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1399</sup></a></p>
<p>After showing that taxes reduce the standard of living of consumers,
Hoppe discusses the sociological reasons <em>for</em> taxation, and ever
more of it. This discussion is fascinating and insightful, but it comes
down to the fact that there is taxation because the government can get
away with it; the government can get away with it because a majority of
the population either actively or passively support such governmental
policies; and the majority support government because of the lack of
(complete, principled) acceptance of a private property ethic.<a
href="#fn1400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1400"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1400</sup></a></p>
<p>Government propaganda plays a role in influencing public opinion.
Hoppe asks how the government could change public opinion from true
ideas (i.e., the historical support in the United States for freedom and
private property) to wrong ideas. He points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would seem that such a change towards falsehood requires the
systematic introduction of exogenous forces: A true ideology is capable
of supporting itself merely by virtue of being true. A false one needs
reinforcement by outside influences with a clear-cut, tangible impact on
people in order to be capable of generating and supporting a climate of
intellectual corruption.<a href="#fn1401" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1401" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1401</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Objectivists who would criticize Hoppe because many of his ideas
were influenced by Kant should note Hoppe’s radical lack of
epistemological and moral skepticism evident in this statement.)</p>
<p>Thus the government effectively buys support from the populace
through a system of transfer payments, grants of privilege, and
governmental provision of certain goods, e.g., education, which makes
the populace increasingly dependent on the continuation of state rule.<a
href="#fn1402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1402"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1402</sup></a> By adopting democracy, the state
“opens every government position to everyone and grants equal and
universal rights of participation and competition in the making of
state-policy.”<a href="#fn1403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1403"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1403</sup></a> Thus people gradually lose sight
of the immorality of the exploitation and expropriation in which they
participate, and are lured “into accepting the view that such acts are
legitimate as long as one is guaranteed a say over them….”<a
href="#fn1404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1404"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1404</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hen everyone is potentially a minister, no one is concerned to cut
down an office to which he aspires one day himself, or to put sand in a
machine which he means to use himself when his turn comes. Hence it is
that there is in the political circles of a modern society a wide
complicity in the extension of power.<a href="#fn1405"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1405"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1405</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe concludes that everything depends on a change in public
opinion. Although this may appear hopeless, “ideas have changed in the
past and can change again in the future … and the idea of private
property has certainly one attraction: it, and only it, is a true
reflection of man’s nature as a rational being.”<a href="#fn1406"

<h5 id="c.-banking-nation-states-and-international-politics"><em>C.
Banking, Nation States, and International Politics</em></h5>
<p>Chapter 3, “Banking, Nation States, and International Politics: A
Sociological Reconstruction of the Present Economic Order,” is the best
and most important chapter in Part One. Here Hoppe explores how and why
the state monopolizes money and banking and shows the danger of the
ever-approaching international monetary order.<a href="#fn1407"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1407"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1407</sup></a> Similarly to the discussion in
chapter 2, this chapter argues that the state arises <em>despite</em>
its inefficiencies and immorality and therefore depends upon public
support, either active or passive. To create legitimacy in the minds of
the public, the state engages in propaganda:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much time and effort is spent persuading the public that things are
not really as they appear: Exploitation is really freedom; taxes are
really voluntary … no one is ruled by anyone but we all rule ourselves;
… etc.<a href="#fn1408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1408"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1408</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, to garner public support, the state also engages in
redistribution: it takes individuals’ wealth, which individuals tend to
resist, but redistributes some of it to individuals in order to corrupt
them into assuming state-supportive roles. Because the state rests upon
coercion, it must of course monopolize the police, defense, and
courts.<a href="#fn1409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1409"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1409</sup></a> In order to be able to regularly
exploit the population, the state must also control traffic and
communications, so it monopolizes these also. The state monopolizes the
field of education to eliminate ideological competition. The state also
adopts a democratic system that opens up potential government jobs and
votes to all, giving the people a legal stake in the state in order to
reduce resistance to state power.<a href="#fn1410" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1410" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1410</sup></a></p>
<p>But “[t]he monopolization of money and banking is the ultimate pillar
on which the modern state rests.”<a href="#fn1411" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1411" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1411</sup></a> Thus the state
monopolizes the minting of gold (to shift psychologically the emphasis
from gold in universal terms like ounces to terms of fiat labels like
“dollars”); passes legal tender laws; monopolizes the banking system;
nationalizes gold; and finally cuts the last tie to gold by declaring
paper notes irredeemable in gold.</p>
<p>But because there is still competition <em>among</em> states, which
limits governments’ abilities to inflate their currencies, governments
have an incentive to expand their territories and to expand the
territory in which each government’s currency is in place. Historically,
the tendency has been towards a one-world government, with a one-world
paper currency, with the United States at the helm, and with no
remaining limit on inflation of the money supply except hyperinflation
and a collapse of the economy. This tendency is likely to continue
unless public opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the only constraint on government growth[,] undergoes a substantial
change and the public begins to understand the lessons explained in this
[chapter]: that economic rationality as well as justice and morality
demand a worldwide gold standard and free, 100% reserve banking as well
as free markets worldwide; and that world government, a world central
bank and a world paper currency—contrary to the deceptive impression of
representing universal values—actually means the universalization and
intensification of exploitation, counterfeiting-fraud, and economic
destruction.<a href="#fn1412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1412"

<h5 id="d.-marxism-reformed-by-praxeology"><em>D. Marxism Reformed by

<p>Chapter 4, “Marxist and Austrian Class Analysis,” is an interesting
chapter that reinterprets the Marxist theory of history from an Austrian
economics perspective. Hoppe argues that the hard-core tenets of the
Marxist theory of history are essentially correct, but are derived in
Marxism from a false starting point; and that the Mises-Rothbard brand
of Austrianism can give a different justification for the validity of
these theses.</p>
<p>The five hard-core Marxist beliefs are: (1) The history of mankind is
the history of class struggles; (2) the ruling class is unified by its
common interest in upholding its exploitative position and maximizing
its exploitatively appropriated surplus product; (3) class rule
manifests itself primarily in specific arrangements regarding the
relations of<br />
production (i.e., the assignment of property rights); (4) internally,
the process of competition within the ruling class generates a
tendency<br />
toward increasing concentration and centralization; and (5) finally,
with the centralization and expansion of exploitative rule gradually
approaching its ultimate limit of world domination, class rule will
increasingly become incompatible with the further development and
improvement of “productive forces.”<a href="#fn1413"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1413"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1413</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoppe points out that Marx’s theory of exploitation is flawed
because, in maintaining that there is exploitation when a capitalist
retains a surplus profit after paying a laborer, his theory does not
take into account nor “understand the phenomenon of time preferencesas a
universal category of human action.”<a href="#fn1414"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1414"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1414</sup></a> Of course, once time
preference<br />
is considered, it can be seen that “contrary to the case of slave and
slave master where the latter benefits at the expense of the former, the
relationship between the free laborer and the capitalist is a mutually
beneficial one.”<a href="#fn1415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1415"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1415</sup></a> It is logically absurd to regard
homesteading of unowned goods, or voluntary agreements between different
homesteaders, as exploitative, because nothing is taken away from
anybody by these activities, and goods are actually created. “Instead,
exploitation takes place whenever any deviation from the homesteading
principle occurs…. Exploitation is the expropriation of homesteaders,
producers and savers by late-coming non-homesteaders, non-producers,
non-savers<br />
and non-contractors….”<a href="#fn1416" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1416" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1416</sup></a> Given this theory
of exploitation, Hoppe analyzes the nature of government to justify the
five Marxist theses above.</p>
<h5 id="e.-mises-versus-keynes"><em>E. Mises Versus Keynes</em></h5>
<p>The final chapter in Part One, “Theory of Employment, Money,
Interest, and the Capitalist Process: The Misesian Case Against Keynes,”
contains an illuminating discussion of the Austrian theories of
employment, money, and interest. After this discussion, Hoppe states
that it is now “easy to recognize Keynes’s ‘new’ <em>General Theory of
Employment, Interest, and Money</em> as fundamentally flawed and the
Keynesian revolution as one of this century’s foremost intellectual
scandals.”<a href="#fn1417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1417"

Keynes’s theories against this backdrop.</p>
<h4 id="v.-conclusion-2">V. CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>Like <em>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</em> before it, <em>The
Economics and Ethics of Private Property</em> contains cutting-edge
economic theories and breakthroughs in epistemology and individual
rights theories. Hoppe is indeed correct that, in the long run, immoral
government policies depend upon the tacit support of the majority of the
population. The only way to win more recognition and enforcement of our
individual rights is to educate the populace of the truth and wisdom of
freedom. The publication of works like Hoppe’s, with an uncompromising,
hard-core (and, more importantly, correct) defense of liberty, certainly
advances this cause.</p>

Kinsella on Libertarian Legal Theory, Self-Ownership and Drug Laws,”
<em>The Daily Bell</em> (July 20, 2014).</p>
<p><strong>The Daily Bell:</strong> It’s been a while since we
interviewed you. Let’s focus on some areas that you’ve been exploring
lately. You’ve been thinking a lot about the essential basis of the
libertarian idea lately, and the relationship between the non-aggression
principle, property rights and related matters. Can you give us insight
into your thinking? What specifically remains confused? What is the
difficulty that people struggle with regarding the non-aggression
principle and property rights?</p>
<p><strong>Stephan Kinsella:</strong> The core insight of the founding
generation of modern libertarian thinkers like Ayn Rand and Murray
Rothbard is that <em>initiating</em> violence against others is wrong,
unjustified, and should be prohibited by law—whether that is state law
(in Rand’s case) or private law (for anarchist libertarians like
Rothbard and Hoppe).</p>
<p>Rand, in Galt’s speech, sets out a “non-initiation of force”
principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So long as men desire to live together, no man may
<em>initiate</em>—do you hear me? No man may <em>start</em>—the use of
physical force against others.<a href="#fn1418" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1418" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1418</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rothbard formulated a similar idea but called it an “axiom”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The libertarian creed rests upon one central axiom: that no man or
group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else.
This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as
the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the
person or property of anyone else. Aggression is therefore synonymous
with invasion.<a href="#fn1419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1419"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1419</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rothbard goes on, in <em>The Ethics of Liberty</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental axiom of libertarian theory is that each person must
be a self-owner, and that no one has the right to interfere with such
self-ownership…. What … aggressive violence means is that one man
invades the property of another without the victim’s consent. The
invasion may be against a man’s property in his person (as in the case
of bodily assault), or against his property in tangible goods (as in
robbery or trespass).<a href="#fn1420" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1420" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1420</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I provide elaboration on some of these issues in other articles and
posts.<a href="#fn1421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1421"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1421</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Rand’s non-initiation of force principle, and Rothbard’s so-called
“non-aggression axiom,” are usually today referred to as the
non-aggression principle, or NAP, by libertarians (some call it the
zero-aggression principle, or ZAP). My impression is that “axiom”
changed to “principle” over the last few decades for a couple reasons.
First, “axiom” was a term heavily used by Objectivists, e.g., in their
epistemological reasoning and terminology, and a growing number of
libertarians are not Objectivists, and so shun that usage.</p>
<p>Second, calling the principle an “axiom” implies that it is either
the primary or only principle, or self-contained or complete; or perhaps
that it is simply an arbitrary postulate as in mathematical axioms; or
even that it is an undeniable, logically deduced starting point. Because
libertarians are diverse in their views on the nature of rights and how
they are justified, it seems better to refer to the non-aggression
principle—a better way to define what views we all share in common,
regardless of how they are arrived at. Randians, for instance, think
that the individual rights implied by the non-initiation of force
principle (i.e., the NAP) are validated by more fundamental
philosophical insights about the nature of man, so they would not want
to view non-aggression as some arbitrary or postulated math-type axiom.
Utilitarian and empiricist type libertarians, intuitionists,
religionists who ultimately base their political ethics on some divine
or moral law or commands, etc., might not want to view non-aggression as
some self-contained or logically deduced starting point. And so on. So
the term “axiom” has become less common. Nonetheless, definitions and
categories are necessary—there is something that makes us all
libertarian, after all. And the idea of the “non-aggression principle”
seems to best capture that, at least as a generally descriptive if
shorthand term.<a href="#fn1422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1422"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1422</sup></a></p>
<p>However, one problem that has arisen is that aggression, as commonly
thought of, has to do with interpersonal violence: invading another
person’s <em>body</em>: physical fighting or clashing. If you say you
are opposed to aggression, this implies you favor self-ownership or,
more precisely, body ownership. But it does not obviously, immediately
imply property rights in <em>other</em> resources, such as land or
movable objects. One would not think of stealing the owned resources of
others as “aggression,” as the term is used in everyday talk. Squatting
on someone’s land or using their hut while they are away might be
trespass, but it does not seem like interpersonal violence that the term
“aggression” seems to be aimed at.</p>
<p>Thus, libertarians tend to elaborate or define the NAP in a somewhat
counterintuitive or idiosyncratic way, so that “aggression,” as they
mean it, covers both interpersonal bodily violence and theft or trespass
against other owned resources. In their elaborations they say that we
oppose aggression against the bodies <em>or property</em> of other
people—and <em>also</em>, that this means <em>fraud</em> is also
prohibited … as is <em>contract breach</em>. This is a lot to pack into
the notion of aggression, into the NAP, which on its face only prohibits
attacking others’ bodies without provocation. They take the idea that it
is wrong to physically attack others’ bodies and then pack into it
related libertarian notions such as: homesteading (how property rights
arise), trespass (use of someone’s owned resource without permission),
contract and abandonment (the capacity to transfer or alienate property
rights in owned resources), and even fraud theory. This cluster of
related ideas or principles is crucial to the libertarian political
philosophy, but it is a lot to put under the rubric of “aggression.”
Both libertarians and our opponents have noticed this, and the former
have sought to clarify our principles, and our terminology.</p>
<p>And, thus, the more sophisticated libertarians have recognized that
property rights are more fundamental than the non-aggression principle.
This is part of what Rothbard was getting at in his insistence that
<em>all rights are essentially property rights</em>.<a href="#fn1423"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1423"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1423</sup></a> It is what Hoppe is getting at in
his Misesian-Austrian influenced theory that property rights arise
because of the fundamental fact of scarcity: the possibility of
<em>conflict</em>.<a href="#fn1424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1424"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1424</sup></a></p>
<p>Why are property rights and how they are allocated more fundamental
than the non-aggression principle? Well, in the case of bodies, the NAP
is virtually <em>synonymous</em> with body-ownership; to say you oppose
aggression is to <em>say that</em> you endorse self-ownership; and
vice-versa. These are basically equivalent normative statements. We do
not need a theory of property allocation for bodies, since opposing
aggression automatically implies that each person is the owner of his
body (libertarians differ on the rationale, but all consistent
libertarians favor self-ownership and oppose interpersonal aggression,
for whatever reason).</p>
<p>But this is not so in the case of <em>external</em> resources—that is
to say, scarce means or goods <em>that were once unowned</em>, unused,
unclaimed, but that now are <em>regarded as means of action</em> by some
human actors.<a href="#fn1425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1425"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1425</sup></a></p>
<p>For such resources, we need a theory of property <em>allocation</em>
to determine the owner of the resource <em>before</em> we can judge a
given use of the resource as “aggression”—i.e., trespass, theft—or not.
If <em>A</em> enters into a hut that <em>B</em> claims, it is trespass,
or “aggression,” only if <em>B</em> is the owner of the hut. If A is the
owner of the hut, then it is not trespass to use it, even if <em>B</em>
objects. Contrast this with <em>A</em> using <em>B</em>’s body without
<em>B</em>’s consent (hitting it, say); simply by being opposed to
aggression, we take <em>B</em>’s side over <em>A</em>’s, because to
oppose interpersonal, bodily aggression <em>means</em> that each person
(at least presumptively) owns his own body.<a href="#fn1426"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1426"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1426</sup></a> But opposing “aggression”
(trespass) for non-human resources requires us to identify who the owner
of a given resource is. In the case of human bodies, it is obvious who
the (presumptive) owner of the body is. Not so for external,
previously-unowned, resources.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is definitely a <em>connection</em> between
self-ownership and property rights in other resources. One’s body is a
<em>means of action</em>, as are other scarce means (resources, goods)
in the world. There can be clashes or conflict over both, and because of
the fundamental, unavoidable and undeniable fact of scarcity, only one
person, one actor, can have the right, or ability, to use a body or
other resource for a given purpose at a given time.</p>
<p>The libertarian principle, then, is based on recognizing this
fundamental condition of human life, and it says that we ought to have
property rights assigned in all scarce resources—any means over which
there could be conflict—so that humans can peacefully, cooperatively,
and productively employ scarce means to pursue their goals; and that
property rights have to be determined in accordance with some objective
criteria—some objective <em>link</em> between the claimant and the
resource in question. It has to be a link that is objective so that
various contestants who claim the resource can recognize it and come to
an agreement about who has the better claim to the resource.</p>
<p>In the case of one’s body, the obvious answer is: each person himself
presumptively has the best link to his body, because of his direct
control of it. It is only presumptive, since some actions, like violent
attacks on others, can justify the victim using self-defense; but it is
the default presumption.</p>
<p>And in the case of other resources, external resources, things that
were once unowned, then obviously the first user of the resource has a
better claim than a latecomer, since without what Hoppe calls the
“prior-later” distinction, there can be no property rights at all, only
a war of all against all and might-makes-right. This latter rule is
supplemented by principles of contractual transfer and rectification.
That is, the earlier user has a better claim to the resource than some
latecomer—<em>unless</em> he did something to change this, such as
contractually transfer (or abandon) the thing, or commit some offense
(tort) against someone else, which obligates him to transfer some of his
property to the victim to make restitution.<a href="#fn1427"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1427"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1427</sup></a></p>
<p>I have no problem with using the concept of aggression, or the NAP
formulation, as a shorthand summary of the basic libertarian idea, but
it must be kept in mind that it is only shorthand, and its meaning can
only be fully grasped by appreciating the nature and purpose of property
rights and how they are allocated.<a href="#fn1428" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1428" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1428</sup></a> We cannot forget
the fundamental fact of scarcity is what gives rise to the possibility
of conflict and thus for the need for property rights to enable social
cooperation.</p>
<p>In recent years some libertarians have objected to the NAP. I think
there are a variety of reasons for this. One is that the relationship
between property and scarcity and rights and aggression as sketched
above has not been fully comprehended by everyone in our relatively
young freedom philosophy (which basically started in the 1960s with Rand
and Rothbard, in my view).<a href="#fn1429" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1429" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1429</sup></a> And, the movement
has been growing in recent decades, with a lot of the newcomers coming
in through Ron Paul and political activism rather than through more
intellectual Randian or Rothbardian approaches. This has resulted in a
large number of people with a fairly surface level understanding of the
connections between liberty, property rights, aggression, and so on. And
they sense that the NAP does not capture everything about the
libertarian principles. So they reject it and seek some deeper
connections or better formulations.</p>
<p>Another reason is that there are many minarchist or even classical
liberal-type libertarians who do not oppose the state itself on
principle, they do not oppose taxation, they accept the idea of public
goods, market failure, and the need for state provision of law and
justice and infrastructure and so on. In other words, they recognize
that if we oppose all aggression, on principle, they have to oppose the
state, and they do not want to do that. So they essentially do what
conservatives and liberals do, which is to count the NAP as just one of
many important moral or societal “values” that “matter.” So they are
against aggression, they will say—but they are also for or against other
things too, and all these competing values must be “balanced” against
each other. We can’t be dogmatic or extreme or doctrinaire, you see.
Yes, yes, we want to reduce aggression, but we want to defend the
country, we want to fund the state and the police and the roads, we want
to prevent people from racially discriminating against minorities and so
on—so you have to compromise or bend the NAP. You have to permit the
state to commit aggression—to tax, to put people in jail for reading the
wrong books or using the wrong drugs or for refusing to fight for the
country in a war—for the greater good. In other words, if you are going
to make an omelet, you have to be willing to break a few eggs.</p>
<p>Some of these statist-“libertarians” are honest and admit they are in
favor of aggression. They think it is unfortunate that we have to permit
some aggression, but it’s necessary to prevent some anarchist chaos. I
can almost respect this type of “rights-utilitarianism,” though I
disagree with it. But others are more disingenuous about this. For
example, they will engage in equivocation—equating aggression to all
forms of force, including self-defense, and saying that the
anarcho-libertarian himself supports aggression (because he recognizes
that self-defense is legitimate), so he makes an “exception” too, just
like the minarchist-statist does. This is blatantly stupid, or
dishonest, in my view, but I’ve seen it many times.</p>
<p>Then we have the emergence of the soi-disant “bleeding heart”
libertarians, the “privilege” checkers and the “thickers,” and so on,
many of whom are in favor of the state and the promotion of values other
than individual (property) rights. They don’t want a rigid—i.e.,
principled—adherence to the NAP to get in the way of using the state or
law to pursue their a-libertarian, or even unlibertarian, goals.</p>
<p>Now, as a human being, I, like every other libertarian, have values
other than liberty. We are not just libertarians, ever. However, we do
value liberty, and we oppose aggression. For us it is a
“side-constraint,” to use Nozick’s phrase: we believe aggression is
simply wrong, or unjustifiable. As Nozick wrote, “Individuals have
rights, and there are things no person or group may do to them (without
violating their rights).”<a href="#fn1430" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1430" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1430</sup></a> When the
conservative, or liberal, or minarchist, or “bleeding heart” libertarian
starts wagging their finger and tut-tutting that they oppose aggression
but that unlike the “simpleminded” libertarian it is not their “only
value,” you can be sure they are setting the stage to propose or endorse
or condone some kind of invasion of liberty—some act of aggression. That
is, when I hear people, even some libertarians, condescendingly denounce
our focus on aggression as the primary social evil, …. I want to hold
onto my wallet, because they are coming after it. Or as Ayn Rand says in
“Francisco’s Money Speech,” “Run for your life from any man who tells
you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper’s bell of an
approaching looter.”<a href="#fn1431" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1431" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1431</sup></a> Likewise, when
someone says aggression is not the only thing that matters, they are
about to advocate aggression. Keep an eye on these people.</p>
<p>To be clear here, among some of these “leftish” type libertarians, I
would distinguish two prominent groups very differently: the “bleeding
heart” libertarians seem by and large to be mushy-headed, non-rigorous
and pro-state while the anarchist left-libertarians are largely
solid—they are against the state, they are mostly solid on economics and
Austrianism (except perhaps for some of the mutualists), they are
against war, they are against intellectual property, etc.In my view, the
bleeding heart types are by and large barely libertarian and promote
horrible and statist ideas, such as a basic guaranteed income,an insane
proposal that most libertarians for the last fifty years could have
instantly recognized as a socialistic and unjustified positive right. By
contrast, the anarchist left-libertarians are by and large great. That
said, I personally think the best and most consistent approach to
libertarianism is Misesian-Rothbardian-Hoppean anarcho-libertarianism,
sometimes called anarcho-capitalism. Incidentally, that latter term is
one I use less now than I used to, partly because of the damage done to
the term “capitalism” by the left-libertarians’ relentless campaign
against it, and partly because it is somewhat misdescriptive: capitalism
refers to only one aspect of the economy of an advanced free market
society; and the economy itself is only one part of a libertarian
society. Just as the NAP can be used as a convenient shorthand for the
libertarian vision of a cooperative, property-rights respecting society,
“capitalism” can also be used as a shorthand term to describe the
libertarian society, though it’s increasingly difficult to do this and
the term is fraught with the potentialfor confusion. Anyway, this is
somewhat of a tangent, now, but what I primarily disagree with the
anarchist left-libertarians on is their “thickism,” some of their
cultural preferences and predictions about what a free society would
look like, and their endorsement of the left-right<br />
spectrum or dichotomy in their use of the left prefix itself. I reject
the left-right spectrum. I think the right or conservatism is virtually
incoherent (why would there be an alliance of neocons, religious right,
and free market chamber of commerce types), and the left is
soft-socialism, and ultimately the right is some variant of socialism
too.<a href="#fn1432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1432"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1432</sup></a></p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Murray Rothbard insisted that all “human rights” are
property rights—why?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: He talked about this in his chapter “‘Human Rights’
As Property Rights,” from his great work <em>The Ethics of Liberty</em>.
Rothbard understood that all disputes—all real disputes—are ultimately
about control of scarce means of action, i.e., physical resources. The
right to freedom of speech or the press makes sense only if understood
as a theory of property rights: the right of a publisher or person to
use his own paper and ink and body as he sees fit. Rothbard was
influenced not only by Rand, but by Mises (Hoppe was in turn influenced
heavily by Rothbard and Mises).</p>
<p>Mises’s praxeology provides an incredibly lucid and useful analysis
of the nature of human action. When humans act, they employ scarce means
(including their bodies) to attempt to causally interfere with the
universe, so as to bring about a different future outcome than they
predict or forecast would otherwise transpire without their acting
intervention—a prospect that gives rise to uneasiness (Mises’s term)
that they seek to quell. In a magical world or the Garden of Eden or the
Land of Cockaigne (Hoppe sometimes calls it Schlaraffenland)<a
href="#fn1433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1433"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1433</sup></a> there is no conflict possible,
but human action is also virtually inconceivable. (Just as human action
is virtually inconceivable in the unrealistic and hypothetical construct
of the “evenly rotating economy” employed by Mises and Rothbard.)<a
href="#fn1434" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1434"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1434</sup></a></p>
<p>In our world, the real world, there is always scarcity, always the
possibility of conflict between actors, always the need to employ scarce
means to pursue ends or goals. Property rights are simply
conflict-avoidance or conflict-reduction norms that civilized people
adopt, respect, and abide by because of their basic values: pro-peace,
pro-society, pro-prosperity, pro-cooperation and so on (I have referred
to these basic values as “grundnorms,” drawing on legal philosopher Hans
Kelsen’s terminology).<a href="#fn1435" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1435" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1435</sup></a> That is why every
right, every human right, every individual right, is ultimately a
property right. All property rights are ultimately enforceable by
physical control of the possessor/user/claimant, and defendable by
physical force (e.g., self defense) or the literal use of force implied
by a <em>law</em> that protects such right.</p>
<p>All law, after all, ultimately is enforced by the use of force
against the body or other possessions of the transgressor. (This is
recognized in the so-called “bad man” theory of law espoused by Supreme
Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.)<a href="#fn1436"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1436"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1436</sup></a> Every conflict, every dispute, is
always, ultimately, about who gets to control a given disputed resource.
That is why every law, every right, is ultimately about property rights:
deciding who the owner is, or should be. There is no way around this.
This is why it is frustrating when mainstream thinkers and even some
libertarians talk vaguely about “human rights”; it opens the door to
legal invasions of property rights. People confusingly say that people
fight over religion; they do not. They fight over others’ bodies and the
physical things, the scarce means (land and so on) that the others have
or want to use. If I threaten to kill you if you do not convert to
Islam, I am really asserting<br />
a property right in your body: I am asserting the right to decide
whether to stick a sword into your belly. The libertarian says: you have
the right to control what gets stuck into your body. Religion is just an
excuse for the property invasion; it is the motivation or reason for the
invasion. But it is impossible to own religion and it is literally
impossible to “fight over religion.” It is always, always, always about
property rights.<a href="#fn1437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1437"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1437</sup></a></p>
<p>The same goes for other false and positive rights, such as
intellectual property (e.g., patent and copyright). The IP advocate says
they support property rights in general but “also” in useful, valuable,
“created” patterns and ideas. But what they really support is legal
theft: using IP as an excuse to take others’ money or to seize a
“negative servitude” over others’ already-owned scarce resources.<a
href="#fn1438" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1438"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1438</sup></a></p>
<p>Ultimately, every political philosophy, every legal system, is about
property rights. They specify a set of rules that determines who the
owner of any given scarce resource is, in the case of a dispute or
contest to control that resource. The libertarian view simply has a
unique way of allocating such property rights, different than other
systems.<a href="#fn1439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1439"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1439</sup></a> All other systems advocate some
form of slavery or theft, since they endorse aggression against others,
which is a form of slavery, or taking of owned resources from the owner
when he does not contractually consent to this.<a href="#fn1440"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1440"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1440</sup></a></p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Why is it crucial that libertarian theory have a
sound basis for property rights and for its unique property assignment
rules?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Property rights make sense only in a world where
there is potential conflict over some identifiable scarce means
(meaning: the real world). For humans to live in society, they need to
acknowledge each other’s existence and respect others’ right to live.
Every human society that has persisted has figured out a way for people
to get along—to agree to certain rules that specify who has the
recognized right to use or control a given resource. Humans need to use
scarce means to achieve results. For those people who recognize that we
exist in society, they recognize benefits of being social (trade,
intercourse, division and specialization of labor) and drawbacks (you
have to curtail certain appetites). The obvious result is the
libertarian property assignment or allocation rule: the owner of a
resource is determined by inquiring into its origin: original
appropriation or contract.<a href="#fn1441" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1441" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1441</sup></a></p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Libertarianism rightly focuses on the concept of
first use of a previously unowned scarce resource as the key test for
determining ownership of it. But some say that land, for instance, can
never be owned, only the improvements on the land. Any truth to
this?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: “Land” is just a referent to a particular scarce
resource.It is surface area on the Earth. Land is just one type of
scarce resource, so is not special in any fundamental sense (although
the law classifies it as realty or immovable property, which has some
different rules for transfer and alienation than does personalty or
movable property, due to its different nature; but in principle it is
just another ownable scarce resource). This is one problem I have with
Georgists, who obsess about land as some special good.<a href="#fn1442"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1442"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1442</sup></a></p>
<p>One argument against ownership of land is that the bulk of the value
of the land is due to natural features that the user/homesteader did not
cause, so he does not “deserve” the full value of the land, but only
that which he himself worked on—the improvement. There are many problems
with this argument. First, in a sense, the homesteader of a good is its
creator—because of the subjective nature of values, the type of “good” a
thing is and whether it is really even a “good,” depends on how it is
regarded by its user.<a href="#fn1443" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1443" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1443</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, the argument is anchored in the flawed labor theory of
property and value. It assumes that values are what property rights
protect; that value can be owned. It cannot. Property rights have to do
with the physical integrity of scarce resources, since all conflicts are
ultimately about incompatible uses of such resources. There is no
property right in the value of resources one owns. Value cannot be
owned.<a href="#fn1444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1444"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1444</sup></a> Nor can labor.<a href="#fn1445"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1445"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1445</sup></a> Lockeans are wrong to say that
the reason there is property rights in things like land is because a
person owns his “self” and therefore he owns his “labor” and therefore
he owns what unowned things he “mixes” his labor with.</p>
<p>Almost every part of this version of Locke is wrong. First, we do not
own our “selves”; this is metaphorical nonsense. We own our bodies.
Second, you do not own your labor any more than you own your actions.
Owning your body gives you the <em>ability</em> and perhaps the
<em>right</em> to use it as you see fit. Just as owning a home gives you
the right to contemplate the stars at midnight, but we would not say
there is some independent “right to contemplate the stars”; this ability
is rather a <em>consequence</em> of having property rights respected in
one’s body, land, and other resources. And even if you owned your labor,
mixing it with some resource—well, “mixing” is itself an ambiguous
metaphor—but it might well simply result in the loss of ownership of the
labor, rather than the acquisition of ownership of the thing the labor
mixed with. If you spit in the ocean, you lose your spit, you do not
homestead the ocean. That said, I think Locke’s basic insight was right;
it is just that it is too complicated and adorned by imprecise metaphors
and unnecessary steps. Hume recognized this.<a href="#fn1446"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1446"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1446</sup></a> The reason you have a right to
own a resource like land is not that you created its value, but that you
staked out a claim before anyone else did. Hoppe calls this
embordering.<a href="#fn1447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1447"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1447</sup></a></p>
<p>For someone to object to my ownership of a plot of land is for them
to assert a property right in the land. For only an owner of the
resource has a ground for objecting to my use of it. But if they claim
to own it, they have to have a basis. Yet <em>per assumption</em>, I was
the first owner or user, not them. So I have a better claim to the land.
This is the essential flaw in the state ownership of national forests
and other undeveloped resources: state agents have not used or
appropriated the resource, they have not done anything to establish a
legitimate claim to the land (and I would argue no state ever can, since
by its nature it is criminal, so that any property rights it ever
acquires, either by contract, expropriation, or even homesteading, are
owed as restitution to the state’s victims), yet they prevent others
from homesteading the resource. They are <em>acting as the owner</em>
even though they are not a legitimate owner. Something similar is the
case in the way the states of the world have coordinated via treaties to
claim ownership of the seabeds, the moon, outer space, Antarctica and
the like.</p>
<p>So the anti-land-ownership “libertarians,” if we can call them that,
are taking a line similar to that of statists and tyrants. In denying
someone the ownership of a resource, they are themselves acting as
owners. Only an owner of a resource can exclude someone else from using
it.<a href="#fn1448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1448"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1448</sup></a> Yet they have no basis for this
ownership claim; it is just arbitrary verbal decree, the type of claim
that cannot serve the function of property rights since it cannot
prevent conflict.<a href="#fn1449" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1449"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1449</sup></a></p>
<p>But there is another argument against land ownership that is more
consistent with libertarian principles. This is the objection to the
enclosure movement, e.g., in England. The argument is that when the
state grants ownership rights in plots of land, they take away existing
rights of people to use the land in certain ways, e.g., for passage. Or
they assign the rights to their cronies. Or they take the land away from
previous owners (e.g., Native Americans in the US). Hoppe sketches a
theory that partial property rights can be homesteaded by use.<a
href="#fn1450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1450"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1450</sup></a> For example, in a town a common
path is used, establishing a collectively owned easement, a right of
passage or right of way (a servitude or easement). Someone who builds a
road later has to recognize the pre-existing passage rights, owned by
residents of the town or their heirs. I believe I read not too long
about some legally recognized right in Italy of the people to cross over
privately owned property for purposes of hunting. One could argue this
type of law is justified by the “partial homesteading” approach Hoppe
outlines.</p>
<p>In this sense one could argue that the state recognition and
enforcement of property rights in land sometimes amounts to a taking of
pre-existing easements that had been privately homesteaded by others.
But this only highlights the fact that the state, and its
legislation-based legal system, inevitably violates rights and mucks
things up. It does not mean that land is special or that property rights
in land are not legitimate. It only means that sometimes there are
partial usage-rights homesteaded by earlier users of the resource, which
property rights must be respected by later comers. In other words, the
only coherent objection to property rights in land rests on a
recognition of the legitimacy of property rights in land (and on at
least an implicit recognition that the state messes things up).<a
href="#fn1451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1451"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1451</sup></a></p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Is ownership always defined by first use?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: As indicated above, ownership in one’s body is not
based on first use, but on one’s intimate connection to, and direct
control over, one’s body. That is, the objective link in the case of the
body that connects a person-claimant-owner to “his” body is that it is
<em>his</em> body; it houses his identity, and he directly controls
it.</p>
<p>For other things—that is, scarce resources, scarce means, economic
goods—“conflictable” things<a href="#fn1452" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1452" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1452</sup></a>—things that were
previously unowned, unclaimed and unused—the objective link between a
given claimant and the disputed resource in question is based upon three
factors or principles: original appropriation (first use, or
labor-mixing), contract, and rectification. In other words, being the
original appropriator is not enough to show ownership, because the
original owner might have abandoned the resource; or contractually
transferred it to someone else, by gift or sale; or might have a debt to
them due to some offense (rectification). So all three considerations
play a role. But as between any two or more claimants to a given
resource, we can in principle decide which one has the better claim by
asking: who had it first; was any contractual transfer or abandonment
done; is there a debt between the claimants that can or has to be
satisfied by a property title transfer. So if <em>A</em> can show he was
using the property before <em>B</em>, he has a presumptively better
claim (note: <em>A</em> does not need to show that he was the first user
of the property, only that he was using it before <em>B</em>).<a
href="#fn1453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1453"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1453</sup></a> But if <em>B</em> can show that
<em>A</em> contractually transferred the property to <em>B</em>, then
<em>B</em> has a better claim than <em>A</em>. Or if <em>A</em> harmed
<em>B</em> and owes <em>A</em> restitution. Or, if <em>A</em> abandoned
the property and then <em>B</em> re-homesteaded it.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: What constitutes first use?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Some questions cannot be answered from the
armchair.<a href="#fn1454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1454"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1454</sup></a> There are more or less general or
abstract legal precepts, and then more or less refined, developed and
applied concrete rules that develop over time due to custom and the
legal system of an advanced society. That said, we have had over two
thousand years of such processes in the Roman law and English common
law, so we are not totally in the dark. I would say that the essential
principle here is what Hoppe identifies in chaps. 1-2 of <em>A Theory of
Socialism and Capitalism</em>: the idea of <em>embordering</em>. If a
resource is not yet claimed or used, then the person who somehow starts
to use it in a way that is publicly visible has a better claim than
others. There needs to be publicly visible borders or boundaries (one
reason I sometimes think the term “private” property is somewhat
inappropriate; all property rights are in some sense “public,”as in
publicly visible),<a href="#fn1455" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1455"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1455</sup></a> to serve the conflict-avoidance
function of property rights. The purpose of property rights is to permit
resources to be used without conflict, and the only way they can serve
this function is if the boundaries or borders of the resource, or of the
usage-right or property rights in the resource, are publicly
visible—that is, objectively visible, or as some Kantian-inspired
theorists like Hoppe might say, “intersubjectively ascertainable.”</p>
<p>And then, also, we have to recognize that if the purpose of property
rights is to permit conflict-free use of resources, and if there would
be no need for property rights in a conflict-free world, then the only
time a question about the scope and nature of particular property rights
could ever arise, in the real world, is in an actual, real, dispute
between two or more persons over a given scarce resource. And in that
dispute, the very nature of the resource in question will be defined: it
is whatever is being disputed or sought by the competing claimants. The
very dispute itself helps define what is the resource in question. This,
in turn, helps determine what type of usage “counts” for homesteading in
the first place.<a href="#fn1456" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1456"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1456</sup></a></p>
<p>The Daily Bell: When does a child become “first owner”?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I do not pretend to have a solid answer to this
difficult issue. My view is that rights are bound up with human
rationality and the capacity to understand, agree with and respect
others’ rights. Hoppe implies as much in the opening chapters of <em>A
Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</em>. Rothbard and others imply that
it is when the child has enough capacity to say “no” and try to run
away.<a href="#fn1457" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1457"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1457</sup></a> My view is roughly along these
lines, but different in some ways. My thinking is this. First, it seems
obvious to me that a one-day old zygote has no rights yet, even though
it is a potential human person, and biologically a “human life.” It also
seems obvious to me that infants have rights, so that infanticide is
murder. And that there is little difference between late-term abortion
and infanticide (even the pro-choice Ayn Rand recognized this: she wrote
“A piece of protoplasm has no rights—and no life in the human sense of
the term. One may argue about the later stages of a pregnancy, but the
essential issue concerns only the first three months.”).<a
href="#fn1458" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1458"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1458</sup></a></p>
<p>It seems to me that it is usually immoral or wrong to abort, even
early on, but at a certain point it becomes tantamount to infanticide.
However, I still think the state or even private law should not
intervene, for a variety of reasons. Basically, the
<em>jurisdiction</em> should remain with the mother or the family until
birth. But I think that at least for a born human, it should be
recognized as having full human rights. The parents can care for and
make decisions on behalf of the child as its natural agent or guardian.
So I think a child is a self-owner from at least the moment of birth,
but it is helpless, and thus we presume the child implicitly consents to
care by its guardians, presumptively its parents.<a href="#fn1459"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1459"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1459</sup></a> As for when the child reaches the
capacity to be responsible for acts of aggression, or to run away and
manumit himself, my feeling is roughly along the lines endorsed by
common sense and the common law—at certain ages or stages of development
in mid-childhood.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: How does a child homestead himself, or reach
adulthood?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: This is interesting because the Montessori
educational approach sees adulthood being reached after four six-year
planes of development, or about age 24. Which seems about right to me,
psychologically, but legally, I think the standard cultural norms on
this get it about right. Eighteen years of age seems to be a good rule
of thumb, though in my view, children younger than this ultimately have
the right to declare independence, if they want to, so long as they have
sufficient mental capacity and maturity so that it is clear the choice
is a considered and real one.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Henry George believed that no land can be owned; only
improvements on land. Can you comment? Was Henry George correct in any
of his thinking in this area?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Well, as indicated above in the comments about
land, I think this is complete nonsense and a deep confusion. First,
land is not special; it is just one type of scarce resource. Second, the
idea that you have a right to own resources only insofar as you improve
them is based on the labor theory of property, which is itself deeply
flawed and which is related to the Marxian labor theory of value.<a
href="#fn1460" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1460"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1460</sup></a> Property rights allocate the
legal right to control a resource when there is a conflict or potential
conflict over the resource. The only question, then, is which of the two
or more contestants or claimants has the better claim. The first user of
a tract of land has a better connection than a latecomer, regardless of
whether the first user can be said to have “created” or even “deserved”
the land or not. His first use is better than that of latecomers,
because without this principle there is no right to ever first use land;
it would lie fallow forever.<a href="#fn1461" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1461" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1461</sup></a> Indeed, it would
not exist, in a sense, because goods are things that are subjectively
regarded as such as demonstrated in action, and if use of the thing is
not possible, it in some sense does not “exist” as a good.<a
href="#fn1462" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1462"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1462</sup></a> Notice that any institution or
agency or person that tells you that you cannot homestead or use a piece
of land is himself or itself asserting ownership rights in it. But based
on what? Not even on first use. But on some arbitrary verbal decree. And
property rights cannot be allocated based on verbal decree, because such
a rule would permit any number of simultaneous claims of ownership with
no objective way to distinguish therebetween, and thus would not serve
the very purpose of property rights, which is to reduce conflict, to
permit conflict-free and cooperative use of scarce resources.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: You’ve called the following a fallacy: “If you own
something, that implies that you can sell it; and if you sell something,
that implies you must own it first. The former idea, which is based on a
flawed idea about the origin and nature of property rights and contract
theory, is used to justify voluntary slavery; the second, which is based
on a flawed understanding of contract theory, is used to justify
intellectual property.” Can you elaborate please?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I discuss this in more detail elsewhere.<a
href="#fn1463" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1463"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1463</sup></a> This is hard to elaborate in a
quick interview. But here is a summary answer.</p>
<p>Ownership means the right to control (technically: the right to
<em>exclude</em> others).<a href="#fn1464" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1464" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1464</sup></a> It is not
automatically clear why this would imply the power or ability or right
to <em>stop</em> having the right to control it. My view is that we own
our bodies not because of homesteading but because each person has a
unique link to his body: his ability to directly control it. Hoppe
recognized this decades ago, as I point out in “How We Come to Own
Ourselves” (ch. 4). I had to find an old German text of his and have it
translated to find out his early insight on this, from 1987. This has
implications for the idea of the voluntary slavery contract and the
so-called inalienability debate. (See chapters 9 and 10.) In fact, the
idea of homesteading one’s body is obvious nonsense. A homesteader is an
actor; an actor already has a body. It is inconceivable to imagine an
actor homesteading his body. Homesteading, or original appropriation,
has to do with the acquisition of property rights, by <em>already
body-owning actors</em>, in external scarce resources in the world that
were <em>previously unowned</em>. For these resources, they are
<em>acquired</em> by intentional action and thus can be abandoned—or,
thus, sold or given to others. So ownership of external resource
<em>does</em> imply the capacity to contract, or sell, but self- or
body-ownership does <em>not</em>, because they have different bases. The
point is that ownership as a legal concept does not imply the right to
sell. Too many libertarians just assume that it does. They are used to
the right to sell in the case of ownership of external resources and
thus assume that right to sell is some inherent right of ownership; it
is not.</p>
<p>The converse mistake is the assertion that if you sell something you
must have owned it. Otherwise you could not have sold it. So pro-IP
advocates observe that people are paid to teach or to provide
information or to invent. So they reason that the person being paid must
have sold something. And to sell it, you must have owned it. You can
only sell things that you own, right? Well what was sold? It was the
information that you were paid to come up with or transmit. Therefore,
information is an object of a sale contract and must be an ownable
thing. Of course, the argument is rarely put this explicitly, mostly
because people making such arguments are legal naïfs, but if it was, it
would be easier to show how ridiculous and flawed it is. Contracts are
simply ways owners of resources grant, or deny, permission to others, to
use the resource, whether the grant of control is temporary or permanent
(as with a lease versus a sale) or whether it is partial or complete, or
whether it is conditional or unconditional. Often this involves an
exchange where two owners of two resources exchange title to these
things: my apple for your pear. My coin for your milk. And so on. But
some title transfers—contracts—are only one-way: a gift, or donation,
say. Or if I agree to perform some action within my capability <em>on
the condition</em> that you give me a monetary payment, this is a
one-way title transfer: only the money is being transferred.</p>
<p>People confuse this because they analogize it to a normal bilateral
exchange and wonder what is being exchanged in the service contract, and
they assume the thing being sold is labor and that it must be ownable.
This is just wrong. A careful study of Rothbard’s truly revolutionary
and path-breaking title-transfer theory of contract is a good idea for
people who want to argue this way. (See chapters 9 and 11.) But the
point is that you cannot use this confused legal reasoning to shore up
the arguments for ownership of labor, or for ownership of the “fruits of
one’s labor,” of or IP. Just because I can persuade someone to give me
money on the condition that I invent something for them or teach or
divulge to them some information does not mean that an invention or
information is an ownable object.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Another major question for libertarians involves when
and why agreements are legally enforceable or in other words, how rights
are voluntarily transferred. Can you offer some insight?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: As indicated above, I think the theory of Rothbard
and Evers on this is the place to start. Contracts are just transfers of
title, or ownership, to a scarce resource by the owner, by some
sufficient communication of his consent (see chapter 9). Outside of
this, actions that are crimes or torts—invasions of the borders of
others’ owned resources—can also be considered to be transfers of
rights, via “rectification” or retaliation. For example if <em>A</em>
attacks <em>B</em>, now <em>B</em> has a right to punch <em>A</em>.
<em>A</em> has in a sense given up his right to object to this force.
The right has been transferred, or forfeited. Or if <em>A</em>
negligently harms <em>B</em>, now <em>B</em> is entitled to claim some
of <em>A</em>’s money as damages; that too results in a transfer. But
notice that intentional aggression, sometimes called “crime,” and torts,
are all <em>intentional</em> actions—as are contracts. These are all
basically actions human actors can take that result in some kind of
change in the rights landscape. This is one reason I am not hostile to
the idea of positive rights—so long as they are the result of one’s
action. If you push someone in a lake, you now have an obligation to
rescue them even though a stranger does not. If you create a dependent
child by copulation, then you have certain parental obligations to care
for this child. It’s a positive obligation but one that you created by
your free action. Libertarians, in my view, are not against positive
obligations—we are just against <em>unchosen</em> positive
obligations.<a href="#fn1465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1465"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1465</sup></a></p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Why does making a promise or agreeing or “committing”
to do something result in a transfer of rights from the promisor to the
promisee? To many—even to many libertarians—it seems elementary and
obvious: If you promise to do something, you may be forced to do it.</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: We are used to thinking this way because the
state’s legal system has characterized it this way for some time. The
idea now is that promises should be binding, if they are made with the
right formalities. One theory that is used to back this up is that
people rely on your promises and would be harmed, would suffer damage,
if you were to be free to renege. But this reasoning is circular, of
course—if the law did not enforce promises it would be unreasonable for
promisees to “rely” on that promise.<a href="#fn1466"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1466"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1466</sup></a> So as Rothbard recognizes, the
“binding promise” theory of contract is not coherent. Contract really
simply means a transaction or arrangement whereby the owner of a
resource exercises his ownership power to grant permission or even to
transfer ownership of the resource to someone else. That is all that
contracts are: title-transfers, with various conditions (triggers)
attached to the transfers.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: By recognizing the legitimacy of defensive force, the
non-aggression principle recognizes that you normally own your body but
you can partially or completely forfeit this right by committing
aggression. True? False?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: In my view, this is correct. Each person owns his
body—<em>presumptively</em>. But if he aggresses against others, they
acquire the right to use force against him—in self-defense, first and
foremost, but also, arguably, to obtain restitution or even for purposes
of retribution. We must, however keep proportionality considerations in
mind, so that aggressors are not “over-punished.” I go into such matters
in some detail in chapter 5.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Can we postulate that only by committing aggression
can you lose rights in your body?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: That is my view. It is a direct implication of the
non-aggression principle. Force is justified in response to initiated
force only. That is the reciprocity or symmetry of the libertarian
ethos. You can do to someone what they do to you, meaning: you can only
use force against someone if they have used force against you. Making a
promise is not a use of force. So voluntary slavery contracts are not
enforceable, as I point out in chapters 9 and 10.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Some argue that there are two ways you can forfeit or
alienate your rights: aggression and saying certain words. Does this
follow?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Well, I believe in general that speech is not a use
of force and thus cannot be considered aggression. Which means force in
response to such speech cannot be justified and would have to be
characterized as aggression. But speech-acts can sometimes be
aggression. Imagine a mafia captain saying to an underling, “Kill Mr.
Jones.” Or President Truman ordering a nuclear bomb to be dropped on
civilian populations in Japan. And so on. (See chapter 8.)</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: To change the subject a bit … we’ve been writing a
lot about marijuana legalization here at <em>The Daily Bell</em>. High
Alert, in fact, is involved in a marijuana venture. If marijuana is
generally legalized, does the state owe compensation to those who were
previously incarcerated?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Well, the state claims ownership of certain scarce
resources, to which everyone who is a state victim has a legitimate
claim for restitution—taxpayers, victims of regulation, prisoners
incarcerated for victimless crimes, and so on. There can never, in
principle, be enough resources in the state’s hands to make full
restitution, since the state always destroys wealth and wealth creation.
So if the state dissolved, it could only pay one cent on the dollar to
its victims, if that. But if a given person has the ability to get a
higher restitution award, I believe they are justified in doing so.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Was there any justifiable reason to incarcerate them
in the first place?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Well, finally, an easy one! Of course not. Drug
laws are completely evil. I believe some day we will look back on this
like we look back on the days of chattel slavery now.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: As a matter of reality, will they receive
compensation?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Of course not.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Any other points you want to make?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I would just encourage people to think
consistently, use coherent and consistent terminology, and think about
the liberty of your neighbors as well as your own.</p>
<p>The Daily Bell: Thanks again for your time.</p>
<h4 id="after-thoughts">After Thoughts</h4>
<p><em>by Anthony Wile</em></p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella makes many good and interesting points in this
interview. He is an eloquent proponent for logical libertarianism and
has offered significant theories on issues of property rights,
copyrights, and ownership in general.</p>
<p>He’s been attacked in the past for empyrean proposals—ones that are
not entirely realistic. But to oppose his vision based on what is
currently real and practical is to miss the point.</p>
<p>Kinsella is building an argument brick by brick for freedom and for
how freedom works. There are others that concentrate on less
hypothetical perspectives. We’re partial to Stephan’s vision because
it’s an uncompromising one.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people that can provide information on how
government interacts with a “free” society but few who follow Ayn Rand’s
hyper-rigorous logic. Of course, Ayn Rand is controversial, especially
in this day and age, but she’s certainly inspired several generations of
libertarian thinkers.</p>
<p>In statements such as “drug laws are completely evil,” we can see
clearly Kinsella’s impatience with what he considers moral relativism.
Again, he can be attacked by enemies for presenting a black and white
vision. But in an era where so many are eager to proclaim shades of
gray, we’re happy to observe (and present) his arguments.</p>
<p>He is a steadfast and creative intellect at a time where it takes
considerable courage to be either. One very obviously worth paying

24: On the Logic of Libertarianism and Why Intellectual Property Doesn’t
Exist</h3>
<p>This was an interview by Anthony Wile at <em>The Daily Bell</em>:
“Stephan Kinsella on the Logic of Libertarianism and Why Intellectual
Property Doesn’t Exist,” <em>The Daily Bell</em> (March 18, 2012). I
would not word the title this way—the problem with intellectual property
(IP) is not that it doesn’t “exist” but rather that IP law is unjust.
But I didn’t choose the title, and have not changed it here.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Bell:</strong> Give us some background on yourself.
Where did you go to school? How did you become a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>Stephan Kinsella:</strong> I was from a young age interested
in science, philosophy, justice, fairness, and “the big questions.” In
high school a librarian recommended I read Ayn Rand’s <em>The
Fountainhead</em>, which started me down that rabbit-hole. I ended up
majoring in electrical engineering at Louisiana State University, from
1983–87. I liked engineering but over time became more and more
interested in political philosophy, economics, philosophy, and so
on.</p>
<p>In the late ’80s, I started publishing columns in the LSU student
newspaper, <em>The Daily Reveille</em>, from an explicitly libertarian
perspective. As my interests became more sharply political and
philosophical, my girlfriend (later wife) and friends urged me to
consider law school. After all, I liked to argue. I might as well get
paid for it! I was by this time in engineering grad school, pursuing an
MSEE degree. Unlike many attorneys I now know, I had not always “wanted
to be a lawyer.” In fact, it had never occurred to me until my
girlfriend suggested it over a family dinner, when I was wondering what
degree I could pursue next—partly in order to avoid having to enter the
workforce just yet. And also to make more money.</p>
<p>At the time I naively thought one had to have a pre-law degree and
many prerequisite courses that engineers would lack; and I feared law
school would be very difficult. I remember my girlfriend’s chemical
engineer father laughing out loud at my concern that law school might be
more difficult than engineering.</p>
<p>So I walked across the LSU campus one day and talked to the vice
chancellor about all this. He tried to dissuade me, saying that
engineering undergrads tended to find law school difficult. But he
conceded that a pre-law degree is not needed; all one needs is a
bachelor’s degree in <em>something</em>, in anything, really. I took the
LSAT and did well enough to get accepted at LSU Law Center. (In the US,
law is a graduate degree, the <em>Juris Doctor</em>, which requires an
initial B.A. or B.S. degree. Because of ABA protectionism. But I
digress.)<a href="#fn1467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1467"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1467</sup></a></p>
<p>I actually greatly enjoyed law school. Unlike many of my fellow law
students, apparently, who seemed in agony. I was free to talk about
laws, rules, human action and interaction. I wasn’t stuck with
mathematical equations. Norms and opinions were relevant. Human
interactions interested me. I enjoyed the Socratic discussion
method.</p>
<p>In one sense, it was unlike electrical engineering, which studies the
impersonal behavior of subatomic particles. In law, the subject matter
is acting humans and the legal norms that pertain to human action. On
the other hand, I found it similar to engineering in that it was
analytical and focused on solving problems. It is less mechanistic and
deterministic than is engineering, but it is still analytical. So if you
are the type of engineer who can shift modes of thought and who is able
to write and speak coherently (not all engineers are), then law school
is fairly easy. By contrast, many liberal arts majors are not used to
thinking analytically. The first year of law school is meant to teach
you to “think like a lawyer”—essentially, to break their spirit and
remold them into the analytical, lawyer-thinking, problem-solving
mold.</p>
<p>In any case, I became a lawyer and do not regret it. It can be
lucrative and mentally stimulating. In my own case, my legal career has
complemented my libertarian and scholarly interests. As Gary North has
pointed out, for most people there is a difference between career and
calling.<a href="#fn1468" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1468"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1468</sup></a> Your career or occupation is what
puts food on the table. Your <em>calling</em> is what you are passionate
about—“the most important thing you can do with your life in which you
are most difficult to replace.” Occasionally they are the same, but
often not; but there is no reason not to arrange your life so as to have
both. If you can manage it. In my case, my various scholarly
publications and networks helped my legal career if only by adding
publications to my CV. And my legal knowledge and expertise, I believe,
has helped to inform my libertarian theorizing.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: You founded your own firm. Tell us how that came
about.</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: After law school my first job was in oil and gas
law at a large Houston-based law firm, Jackson Walker. I found the work
fascinating; it was all about contract and property rights. Then I moved
into patent law because it was more in demand at this time (mid ’90s),
and unlike state-based oil &amp; gas law, it is a national legal field
and so allows more geographic mobility. My wife’s employer at the time
was pushing her to take a job in the head office outside Philadelphia.
So I switched to patent law in part to accommodate this and in part to
capitalize on the then-burgeoning field of IP law.</p>
<p>I recall discussing my career choices at this time with my friend,
LSU law professor Saúl Litvinoff, an old-world gentleman, who confessed
that he was “nonplussed” that I, a man, a husband, would take into
account my wife’s career plans in my own career decisions. Oh, well.
Different times.</p>
<p>I ended up taking a job with a Philadelphia law firm, Schnader
Harrison, doing patents and related IP work. I and others there ended up
moving later to Duane Morris, and when I moved back to Houston in 1997,
I opened their Houston office and was eventually made partner. In 2000 I
decided to join one of my clients, an optoelectronics company (think:
lasers), as general counsel. At the time I had been at big law firms for
about ten years and had learned a lot and enjoyed it but was ready for a
change. And after about ten years as general counsel, I was ready for
another shift, so I have recently formed my own legal practice,
specializing in intellectual property, technology and commercial
law.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Why were you attracted to Austrian economics and why did
libertarianism attract you?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I was always interested in science, truth,
goodness, and fairness. I have always been strongly individualistic and
merit-oriented. This is probably because I was adopted and thus have
always tended to cavalierly dismiss the importance of “blood ties” and
any inherited or “unearned” group characteristics. This made me an ideal
candidate to be enthralled by Ayn Rand’s master-of-universe “I don’t
need anything from you or owe you anything” themes.</p>
<p>Another factor is my strong sense of outrage at injustice, which
probably developed as a result of my hatred of bullies and bullying. I
was frequently attacked by them as a kid because I was small for my age,
bookish, and a smartass. Not a good combination.</p>
<p>A librarian at my high school (Catholic High School in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana), Mrs. Reinhardt, one day recommended Ayn Rand’s <em>The
Fountainhead</em> to me. (I believe this was in 1982, when I was a
junior in high school—the same year Rand died.) “Read this. You’ll like
it,” she told me. I devoured it. Rand’s ruthless logic of justice
appealed to me. I was thrilled to see a more-or-less rigorous
application of reason to fields outside the natural sciences. I think
this helped me to avoid succumbing, in college, to the simplistic and
naïve empiricism-scientism that most of my fellow engineering classmates
naturally absorbed. Mises’s dualistic epistemology and criticism of
monism-positivism-empiricism, which I studied much later, also helped
shield me from scientism.</p>
<p>By my first year of college (1983), where I studied electrical
engineering, I was a fairly avid “Objectivist” style libertarian. I had
read Henry Hazlitt’s <em>Economics in One Lesson</em> and some of Milton
Friedman’s works,<a href="#fn1469" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1469"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1469</sup></a> but I initially steered clear of
self-styled “libertarian” writing. Since Rand was so right on so many
things, I at first assumed she must be right in denouncing
libertarianism as the enemy of liberty. I eventually learned better, of
course (for example, when I saw Libertarian Party pamphlets on campus
before the 1988 Presidential election, and when I attended a Ron Paul
appearance on campus as part of his campaign).</p>
<p>Daily Bell: How did you meet Lew Rockwell and become affiliated with
Mises?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I eventually started reading more radical
libertarians like Rothbard and Austrians like Mises and Hayek and soon
became an Austrian and anarchist. The Austrian approach to knowledge
made so much sense to me. It was rigorous without being mathematical and
it was “Kantian” without succumbing to idealism: Like Rand’s
epistemology, the Misesian approach is also realistic.<a href="#fn1470"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1470"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1470</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1988, when I was in law school, I read Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s
controversial and provocative article in <em>Liberty</em>, “The Ultimate
Justification of the Private Property Ethic.”<a href="#fn1471"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1471"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1471</sup></a> In this article Hoppe sets forth
his “argumentation ethics” defense of libertarianism. This idea had a
profound influence on me. I wrote several papers defending libertarian
ethics based on this theory, and I wrote an in-depth review essay of
Hoppe’s <em>The Economics and Ethics of Private Property</em> (see
chapter 22). I promptly sent it to Hoppe, who sent back a warm thank you
note. This was around 1994.</p>
<p>Later that year, in October 1994, I attended the John Randolph Club
meeting which was held near Washington, D.C., primarily to meet Hoppe,
Rothbard, and Rockwell. While there I was able to get Rothbard to
autograph my copy of <em>Man, Economy, and State</em>, which he
inscribed “<em>To Stephan: For Man &amp; Economy, and against the
state—Best regards, Murray Rothbard</em>” (he died the following
January). I started attending and speaking at various Mises Institute
conferences such as their annual Austrian Scholars Conference.<a
href="#fn1472" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1472"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1472</sup></a> I am now involved with Hoppe’s
Property and Freedom Society, which has annual meetings in Bodrum,
Turkey, since its founding in 2006.<a href="#fn1473"

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1473</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: Tell us about your legal theory of property and how you
came to believe that intellectual property doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: My main interest has always been and remains the
basics of libertarian ethics: What are individual rights and property,
how is this justified, and so on. As I discuss in some previous writing,
from the beginning of my exposure to libertarian ideas, the IP issue
nagged at me.<a href="#fn1474" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1474"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1474</sup></a> I was never satisfied with Ayn
Rand’s justification for it, for example. Her argument is a bizarre
mixture of utilitarianism with overwrought deification of “the
creator”—not <em>the</em> Creator up there, but Man, The Creator,
initial caps, who has a property right in what He Creates. Her proof
that patents and copyrights are property rights is lacking.<a
href="#fn1475" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1475"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1475</sup></a></p>
<p>So I kept trying to find a better justification for IP and this
search continued after I started practicing patent law, in 1993 or
so.</p>
<p>Many libertarians abandon minarchy in favor of anarchy when they
realize that even a minarchist government is unlibertarian. That was my
experience.<a href="#fn1476" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1476"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1476</sup></a> And it was like this for me also
with IP. I came to see that the reason I had been unable to find a way
to justify IP was because it is, in fact, unlibertarian. As the anti-IP
Benjamin Tucker said of his pro-IP opponent Victor Yarros, in the IP
debate in the pages of <em>Liberty</em> in the late 1800s, “if he
[Yarros] has failed [in his attempts to justify IP] and, so far as I
know it, such is the nearly unanimous verdict of the readers of
<em>Liberty</em>,—the fault is not with the champion, but with his
hopeless cause.”<a href="#fn1477" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1477"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1477</sup></a> So, too, was my attempt to
justify IP a hopeless cause.</p>
<p>In coming to understand IP could not be justified, I was heavily
influenced by previous thinkers, such as Tom Palmer and Wendy McElroy.<a
href="#fn1478" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1478"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1478</sup></a> Perhaps the unlibertarian
character of patent and copyright would have been obvious if Congress
had not enacted patent and copyright statutes long ago, making them part
and parcel of America’s “free-market” legal system—and if early
libertarians like Rand had not so vigorously championed such rights.</p>
<p>But libertarianism’s initial presumption should have been that IP is
invalid, not the other way around. After all, we libertarians already
realize that “intellectual” rights, such as the right to a reputation
protected by defamation law, are illegitimate.<a href="#fn1479"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1479"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1479</sup></a></p>
<p>Why, then, would we presume that other laws, protecting intangible,
intellectual rights, are valid—especially artificial rights that are
solely the product of legislation, i.e., decrees of the
fake-law-generating wing of a criminal state?<a href="#fn1480"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1480"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1480</sup></a></p>
<p>But IP is widely seen as basically legitimate. There have always been
criticisms of existing IP laws and policies and many calls for “reform.”
But I became opposed not just to “ridiculous” patents and “outrageous”
IP lawsuits, but to patent and copyright <em>per se</em>. Patent and
copyright law should be <em>abolished</em>, not reformed. The problem is
not “abuse” of the system, but, as Burke said, the “thing itself.”<a
href="#fn1481" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1481"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1481</sup></a> The basic reason is that patent
and copyright are explicitly anti-competitive grants by the state of
monopoly privilege, rooted in mercantilism, protectionism, and thought
control.<a href="#fn1482" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1482"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1482</sup></a> To grant someone a patent or
copyright is to grant them a right to control others’ property—a
“negative servitude” granted by state fiat instead of contractually
negotiated.<a href="#fn1483" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1483"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1483</sup></a> This is a form of theft,
trespass, or wealth redistribution.</p>
<p>So to answer your question: IP rights—patent and copyright—“exist,”
but are not legitimate any more than welfare rights are. There are many
types of IP;<a href="#fn1484" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1484"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1484</sup></a> all are illegitimate, in my view.
Not only because most of them are based on and require legislation (I
view all legislation as unlibertarian; see chapter 13) but because they
try to set up rights in non-scarce things, which in effect grants
negative servitudes to some people at the expense of the property rights
of others.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: According to Wikipedia and other sources, “In contract
theory, you extend Murray Rothbard’s and Williamson Evers’s title
transfer theory of contract linking with inalienability theory.” What
does that mean?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I discuss these issues in various articles (see
chapters 9 and 10). The basic idea is to root the entire idea of
contract in a libertarian theory of property. The latter is based on the
realization that the entire purpose of property rights is to solve the
problem of incompatible uses of scarce resources. The fact that some
things in the world are scarce (or conflictable) resources means that
these resources can be used as means of action only if ownership is
assigned and socially recognized. For things that are not scarce, there
is no social problem to be solved. Hans-Hermann Hoppe addresses these
issues in the opening chapters of his foundational treatise <em>A Theory
of Socialism and Capitalism</em>.</p>
<p>Rothbard recognized that all individual rights are property rights
and, therefore, that a theory of contract is not about enforceable or
binding “promises” but simply about how owners of resources can
contractually transfer title to others. As Rothbard recognized, this has
implications for alienability or so-called “voluntary slavery”
contracts. Many libertarians, assuming contracts are just binding
promises, see no reason one could not bind oneself to be a slave. (See
chapters 9–11.) But if you view contracts as simply transfers of title
to owned objects, then the question arises: Is one’s body alienable, or
not? You cannot just assume that it is. Rothbard argued that it was
not.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: You also attempted to clarify the theory. How so?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Rothbard sketched the theory in 1974; Evers
elaborated on it in 1977, based on Rothbard’s insights. Rothbard then
built on Evers’s pioneering article in his 1982 <em>Ethics of
Liberty</em>.<a href="#fn1485" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1485"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1485</sup></a> But neither were lawyers and only
took this analysis so far. I tried to incorporate their insights and
integrate them with other Rothbardian, Misesian, and Hoppean insights
about property rights and liberty and with established legal concepts,
such as those developed under the Roman-influenced continental or
civil-law systems, which I regard as more libertarian, in some respects,
than the more feudalistic common-law concepts.<a href="#fn1486"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1486"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1486</sup></a></p>
<p>My basic approach is to recognize that mainstream legal theories of
contract have been muddied by unlibertarian and positivistic conceptions
of law and rights. Questions about what rights are “alienable” or not,
loose talk about how promises should be “binding,” etc., highlight the
need for clarity in this area. In my view, to sort these issues out one
needs a very clear and consistent understanding of the nature of
property rights and ownership. First, we must recognize that only scarce
resources are ownable; second, that the body is a type of scarce
resource; third, that the mode of acquiring title to external objects is
different from the basis of ownership of one’s own body. The libertarian
view is that human actors are self-owners, and these self-owners are
capable of appropriating unowned scarce resources by Lockean
homesteading—some type of first use or embordering activity. Obviously,
an actor must already own his body if he is to be a homesteader;
self-ownership is not acquired by homesteading but rather is presupposed
in any act or defense of homesteading. The basis of self-ownership is
the fact that each person has direct control over the scarce resource of
his body and therefore has a better claim to it than any third party
(and any third party seeking to dispute my self-ownership must
presuppose the principle of self-ownership in the first place since he
is acting as a self-owner).<a href="#fn1487" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1487" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1487</sup></a></p>
<p>So there is a difference between body-ownership and ownership of
external scarce goods. An actor is a self-owner; self-owners are able to
acquire property rights in external, unowned objects by homesteading
them—or by contractual acquisition from a previous owner. Many
libertarians simply assume that if you own something, you can sell it.
Thus, they conclude that if we are self-owners, we can sell our bodies.
(Walter Block makes this argument.) My view is that we start with the
nature of ownership: Ownership means the right to exclude others. It
does not automatically imply the “right to sell,” since this is actually
moving from a situation where you have the right to exclude to one where
you <em>do not</em>. But in the case of formerly unowned resources,
because of the way ownership is acquired, it can be undone, in effect.
Homesteading an object requires more than just possession—it requires
the intent to own. So if the intent to own is abandoned, then the thing
is no longer owned, but merely possessed (if that). Thus, an owner of an
object can transfer ownership to another by allowing the other to
possess the object and then manifesting his intent to abandon ownership
“in favor” of the new possessor. The new possessor then, in effect,
re-homesteads the item, becoming its new owner. In other words, the
nature of ownership in external objects means that it is possible to
abandon ownership to them or use this abandonment method to transfer
title to someone else. So ownership does not directly include the “right
to sell,” but it so happens to imply this power, for acquired property.
However, the same is simply not true of one’s body. There is no way to
“undo” the homesteading of your body since you did not homestead it in
the first place. There is no way to abandon your ownership of your body
since it is rooted in your better claim to it based on your direct
control over it. Merely stating “I promise to be your slave” doesn’t
change your status as having a better claim to your body, than third
parties. (For more on this, see chapter 11.)</p>
<p>So in exploring the Rothbard-Evers title transfer theory of contract
and in building on insights by Hoppe about the crucial importance of
scarcity to property rights and his insights as to the nature of
self-ownership and homesteading, I tried to identify the difference
between body and external resource ownership, the basis and nature of
acquisition of rights in each, and the nature of what contracts are
(transfers of title to alienable owned objects) and what implications
this has for body-alienability (namely, that voluntary slavery contracts
are unenforceable and invalid).</p>
<p>Daily Bell: You advance a theory of causation that attempts to
explain why remote actors can be liable under libertarian theory. Can
you clarify this point, please?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I had long been dissatisfied with the approach
various libertarians take to the issue of responsibility for aggression
caused by leaders or groups. Too often libertarians made what seemed to
me to be too simplistic or unjustified assumptions, which they relied on
in their analysis. For example, some seemed to assume that there is a
fixed amount of responsibility, so that if you say the mafia boss is
responsible for ordering a hit, then the lackey who committed the
killing is innocent. Or some would argue that a mafia boss or general or
president is not responsible for the aggression committed by his
underlings, unless he had coerced them or had a “contract” with
them.</p>
<p>These all seemed confused to me. As for the latter: a contract is
just a title transfer, so it is unclear why <em>A</em> hiring <em>B</em>
to kill <em>C</em> means <em>A</em> is liable, but <em>A</em> persuading
<em>B</em> through sexual favors to kill <em>C</em> is not. Focusing on
<em>ad hoc</em> exceptions to the rule that <em>A</em> is not
responsible for <em>B</em>’s actions seemed confused to me. The Austrian
theory of subjective value teaches us that there are many ways to
incentivize or motivate or induce someone to commit an action for you:
you can promise sexual favors, promise to pay money, hire someone, and
so on. Also, there is no reason to think that both the boss and his
underling cannot both be 100% responsible: in the law this is called
joint and several liability.</p>
<p>So in developing a paper called “Reinach and the Property
Libertarians on Causality in the Law” for a Mises Institute symposium in
2001 on Adolf Reinach and Murray Rothbard (see chapter 8), I relied on
Mises’s praxeological understanding of the structure of human action and
cooperative action in general. Mises points out that in a market economy
with the division and specialization of labor, people use others as
<em>means</em> to achieve their ends. This is the essence of market
cooperation.</p>
<p>When the aim is peaceful production of wealth, this is good. But
people can cooperate to engage in collective aggression too. In this
case the members of the group conspire to achieve an illicit end, such
as theft or murder. Just as a man can use a gun (a means) to commit
aggression, so people can employ others as means to commit crimes.
Sometimes these other people are innocent (e.g., hiring a boy to deliver
a bomb concealed in a package) and other times they are complicit (the
mafia boss’s underling). In the latter case, both actors are aggressors,
as they play a causal role in action that uses efficacious means to
achieve the end of invading the borders of the property of innocent
victims. The argument is general and praxeological and focuses on the
intent of the actor (which relates to the praxeological <em>end</em> or
goal of the action) and the <em>means</em> employed, whether that means
be an inanimate good or another human. Thus, there is no need to resort
to <em>ad hoc</em> exceptions such as “the boss is liable because he was
coercing the underling” or “the boss is liable because of a contract
with” the underling. (For more on this, see chapter 8; also chapters
9–11.)</p>
<p>Daily Bell: You provide non-utilitarian arguments for intellectual
property being incompatible with libertarian property rights principles.
Can you explain this?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I alluded to this above in my discussion about
negative servitudes. An IP right gives the holder the right to stop
others from using their property as they wish. For example, George
Lucas, courtesy of copyright law, can use the force of state courts to
stop me from writing and publishing “The Continuing Adventures of Han
Solo.” J.D. Salinger’s estate was able to block the publication of a
sequel to <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, for example. This is
censorship.<a href="#fn1488" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1488"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1488</sup></a> And Apple can get a court order
blocking Samsung from selling a tablet if it resembles an iPad too
closely. This is just protection from competition.<a href="#fn1489"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1489"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1489</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: You offer a discourse ethics argument for the
justification of individual rights, using an extension of the concept of
“estoppel.” Can you expand please?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: This approach is laid out in chapters 5 and 6. The
libertarian approach is a very symmetrical one: the non-aggression
principle does not rule out force, but only the <em>initiation</em> of
force. In other words, you are permitted to use force only <em>in
response to</em> some else’s use of force. If they do not use force you
may not use force yourself. There is a symmetry here: force for force,
but no force if no force was used.</p>
<p>Now in law school I learned about the concept of estoppel, which is a
legal doctrine that estops or prevents you from asserting a position in
a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with something you had done
previously (see chapters 1 and 9). You have to be consistent. I was at
this time fascinated with Hoppe’s argumentation ethics, which is
probably why it struck me that the basic reasoning of legal estoppel
could be used to explain or justify the libertarian approach to symmetry
in force: The reason you are permitted to use force against someone who
himself initiated force is that he has already, in a sense, admitted
that he thinks force is permissible, by his act of aggression. Therefore
if he were to complain if the victim or the victim’s agents were to try
to use defensive or even retaliatory force against him, he would be
holding inconsistent positions: His pro-force view that is implicit and
inherent in his act of aggression and his anti-force view implicit in
his objection to being punished. Using language borrowed from the law,
we might say he should be “estopped” (prevented) from complaining if a
victim were to use force to defend himself from the aggressor or even to
punish or retaliate against the aggressor. I tried to work this into a
theory of libertarian rights, relying heavily on insights from Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics and from his social theory in general.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Please comment on and summarize the following books you
wrote, with special emphasis on your IP theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Protecting Foreign Investment Under International Law: Legal
Aspects of Political Risk</em> (with Paul E. Comeaux). Oceana
Publications, 1997</p>
<p><em>Online Contract Formation</em> (with Andrew Simpson). Oxford

<p><em>Against Intellectual Property.</em> Ludwig von Mises Institute,

</blockquote>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: The first three books are legal treatises that have
little do with libertarianism or IP, although the first and third do
examine practical ways for international investors to use international
law to protect their property from takings from the host state.<a
href="#fn1490" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1490"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1490</sup></a></p>
<p>The latter monograph was first published as an article in the
<em>Journal of Libertarian Studies</em> in 2001, with the title
suggested by Professor Hans-Hermann Hoppe, then the journal’s editor. My
initial title had been “The Legitimacy of Intellectual Property,” the
name of the earlier paper I had delivered at the Austrian Scholars
Conference the preceding year. (I discuss this in chapter 14.)</p>
<p>It was only 11 years ago [from 2012], but at the time there was not
yet much interest among libertarians in intellectual property (IP). It
was thought of as an arcane and insignificant issue, not as one of our
most pressing problems. Libertarian attention was focused on taxes, war,
the state, the drug war, asset forfeiture, business regulations, civil
liberties, and so on, not on patent and copyright.</p>
<p>I felt the same way. I looked into this issue primarily because I had
been, since 1993, a practicing patent attorney and had always been
dissatisfied with Ayn Rand’s arguments in favor of IP.<a href="#fn1491"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1491"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1491</sup></a> Her weird admixture of
utilitarian and propertarian arguments raised red flags for me. It
included tortuous arguments as to why a 17-year patent term and a
70-year copyright term were just about right and why it was fair for the
first guy to the patent office to get a monopoly that could be used
against an independent inventor just one day behind him.</p>
<p>I sensed Rand’s approach was wrong, but I assumed there must be a
better way to justify IP rights. So I read and thought and tried to
figure this out. In the end, I concluded that patent and copyright are
completely statist and unjustified derogations from property rights and
the free market. So I wrote the article to get it out of my system and
then moved on to other fields that interest me more, like rights theory,
libertarian legal theory and the intersection of Austrian economics and
law.</p>
<p>In the meantime, with the flowering of the Internet and digital
information and with increasing abuses of rights in the name of IP, more
and more libertarians have become interested in the IP issue and have
realized that it is antithetical to libertarian property rights and
freedom.<a href="#fn1492" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1492"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1492</sup></a> It is in fact becoming a huge
threat to freedom and increasingly used by the state against the
Internet, which is one of the most important weapons we have against
state oppression.<a href="#fn1493" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1493"

<p>Daily Bell: What is the reaction to your theory of IP? Hostility?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: At first there was apathy. The few people who
thought about it mostly thought my views were too extreme—maybe we need
to fix copyright and patent, but surely the basic idea is sound. But my
impression is that nowadays most libertarians are strongly opposed to
IP.<a href="#fn1494" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1494"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1494</sup></a> And, in fact, scholars associated
with the Mises Institute sensed the importance of this issue earlier
than most—for example, the Mises Institute awarded my “Against

<p>Daily Bell: How do you think artists and writers feel about it? What
do they do to make a living if they do not receive royalties?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Well, sharing is not piracy, and copying is not
theft. (And competition is not theft, either.)<a href="#fn1497"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1497"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1497</sup></a> But people are used to thinking
in these terms, due to state- and special interest-inspired propaganda
to the contrary.<a href="#fn1498" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1498"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1498</sup></a> Most artists and writers do not
make much money from copyright; if they are successful at all, they
typically go through<br />
a publisher who makes most of the profits and owns the copyrights
anyway. Luckily, technology is allowing writers and musicians to bypass
the publishing and music industry gatekeepers.</p>
<p>There are any number of models artists can use to profit from their
talent and artistry. It is not up to the state to protect them from
competition. Musicians can obviously get paid for performing, and having
their music copied and “pirated” helps them in this respect by making
them more well known, more popular. As Cory Doctorow has noted, “for
pretty much every writer—the big problem isn’t piracy, it’s
obscurity.”<a href="#fn1499" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1499"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1499</sup></a> Artists are just entrepreneurs.
It’s up to them to figure out how or if they can make a monetary profit
from their passion—from their calling, as I discussed above. Sometimes
they can. Musicians can sell music, even in the face of piracy. Or they
can sell their services—concerts, etc. Painters and other artists can
profit in similar ways. A novelist could use kickstarter for a sequel or
get paid to consult on a movie version.<a href="#fn1500"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1500"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1500</sup></a> Authors of non-fiction such as
academic articles do not even get paid today—but it enhances their
reputations and helps them land jobs in academia, for example. Inventors
have an incentive to invent to make better products that outcompete the
competition—for a while. Or they are hired in the R&amp;D department of
a corporation that is always trying to innovate. And so on.<a
href="#fn1501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1501"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1501</sup></a> And if you cannot make your
calling your career, then find a way. As director Francis Ford Coppola
has observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to remember that it’s only a few hundred years, if that
much, that artists are working with money. Artists never got money.
Artists had a patron, either the leader of the state or the duke of
Weimar or somewhere, or the church, the pope. Or they had another job. I
have another job. I make films. No one tells me what to do. But I make
the money in the wine industry. You work another job and get up at five
in the morning and write your script.<a href="#fn1502"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1502"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1502</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daily Bell: We find your theories reasonable, but are you making
headway? Are people generally hostile?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: As I mentioned earlier, libertarians have, in my
impression, generally become more opposed to IP, and generally on
principled grounds. Most “mainstream” people are reluctant to take a
principled or “extreme” position, instead recognizing that IP is
“broken” and needs to be “reformed.” They think IP abolitionism is too
extreme, but really cannot articulate why. So they advocate “reform.”<a
href="#fn1503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1503"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1503</sup></a> Those who stubbornly insist on
defending IP have to keep coming up with increasingly absurd arguments
to justify it.<a href="#fn1504" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1504"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1504</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: We’ve come to the conclusion that copyright law and
patent law are deterrents to progress and technology. Your view?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: The empirical studies all point in this
direction.<a href="#fn1505" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1505"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1505</sup></a> And this should not be
surprising. Everything the state does, without exception, destroys
(okay, it’s good at propaganda as well—making people think it’s
necessary). Patent and copyright are pure creatures of state
legislation. The origins of copyright lie in censorship and thought
control; the origins of patents lie in mercantilism and protectionism.
As Tom Palmer writes, “[m]onopoly privilege and censorship lie at the
historical root of patent and copyright.”<a href="#fn1506"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1506"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1506</sup></a> It should be no surprise that
state interventions in the market lead to destruction of wealth, which
of course will have an adverse effect on innovation.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: What would the world look like without patent and
copyright law?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: As far as copyright, I think it would look somewhat
like what our current world is heading to since there is rampant
“piracy” despite copyright law. Except there would be fewer outrageous,
draconian results like jail terms and prison.<a href="#fn1507"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1507"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1507</sup></a> And there would be more freedom
to engage in remixing and other forms of creativity and a richer public
domain to draw on. We would still have a huge amount of artistic works
being created, of course.</p>
<p>Without patents, companies would be free to compete without fear of
lawsuits—and without being able to rely on a state-granted monopoly
privilege to protect them from competition. I believe that an IP-free
world would have far more innovation and diverse creativity than today’s
world. And there would be fewer barriers to entry, so smaller companies
could compete with the oligopolies that patent law has helped to
create.<a href="#fn1508" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1508"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1508</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: Can you explain how patent and copyright law evolved and
why it was likely a reaction to the Gutenberg Press and a means of
controlling information rather than protecting the public?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: The roots of copyright lie in censorship. It was
easy for state and church to control thought by controlling the scribes,
but then the printing press came along, and the authorities worried that
they couldn’t control official thought as easily. So Queen Mary created
the Stationer’s Company in 1557, with the exclusive franchise over book
publishing, to control the press and what information the people could
access. When the charter of the Stationer’s Company expired, the
publishers lobbied for an extension, but in the Statute of Anne
(1710),<br />
Parliament gave copyright to authors instead. Authors liked this because
it freed their works from state control. Nowadays they use copyright
much as the state originally did: to censor and ban books—or their
publishers do, who have gained a quasi-oligopolistic gatekeeper
function, courtesy of copyright law.<a href="#fn1509"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1509"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1509</sup></a> And now we see copyright being
used, along with regulation of gambling, child pornography, and
terrorism,as an excuse for the state to radically infringe Internet
freedom and civil liberties.<a href="#fn1510" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1510" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1510</sup></a></p>
<p>Patents originated in mercantilism and protectionism; the crown would
grant monopolies to favored court cronies, such as monopolies on playing
cards, leather, iron, soap, coal, books, and wine. The Statute of
Monopolies (1623) eliminated much of this but retained the idea of a
monopoly grant to an inventor of some useful machine or process.<a
href="#fn1511" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1511"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1511</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: Didn’t Germany do better <em>without</em> strict
copyright than Britain did <em>with</em> it? Isn’t this the reason that
Germany progressed so much in literature, philosophy, mathematics, etc.,
during the 17th and 18th centuries?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: It probably had something to do with it. One study,
by economic historian Eckhard Höffner, indicates that Germany’s lack of
copyright in the 19th century led to an unprecedented explosion of
publishing, knowledge, etc., unlike in neighboring countries England and
France, where copyright law enriched publishers but stultified the
spread of knowledge and limited publishing to a mass audience.<a
href="#fn1512" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1512"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1512</sup></a> Höffner’s study claims that this
is the main reason that Germany’s production and industry had caught up
with everyone else by 1900. This seems believable to me.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Shouldn’t the enforcement of copyright law be strictly
civil? When did it become a criminal offence?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I am not sure exactly when the criminal penalties
were added, but as I noted above, there are potentially severe civil and
criminal penalties for copyright infringement, including prison,
extradition, being banned from the Internet, and so on.<a href="#fn1513"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1513"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1513</sup></a> Patent law can also be enforced
not only by a damages award but also by a court injunction ordering a
competitor to stop making a given product, on pain of contempt of court.
And patent law literally kills people.<a href="#fn1514"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1514"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1514</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: Why is Kim Dotcom in prison in New Zealand?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I’ve discussed this case in a number of posts on
C4SIF.<a href="#fn1515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1515"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1515</sup></a> Basically, he offered a service
that permitted people to share files (information) with each other. This
crackdown threatens any number of “legitimate” sites and services such
as YouTube, Yousendit, Dropbox, and so on.<a href="#fn1516"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1516"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1516</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: We’ve postulated a simpler solution than what you
present. We’ve pressed the argument for private justice—clan and tribal
justice as practiced for thousands of years. In this formulation no
“authority”<br />
is present but those agreed upon by the two parties to the
quarrel/crime. Thus, copyright issues would become incumbent on the
copyright holder to enforce. In other words, the <em>copyright
holder</em> not the state would have the expense of enforcement. What’s
your take on this?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I suppose this could be an improvement but I think
it’s still misguided. Any attempt to use force against people using
information would be aggression. The only exception would be if someone
has contractually agreed to pay a fine if they use information in an
unapproved way. But who would sign such a ridiculous contract?</p>
<p>In the end, I believe there is nothing wrong with using information.
If you reveal information to the public by telling people or selling
some product that embodies or otherwise makes evident some idea, you
have to expect people to learn from this, compete with you, maybe
emulate or copy it or even build on and improve on it. As Wendy McElroy
has explained, quoting Benjamin Tucker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]f a man publicized an idea without the protection of a contract,
then he was presumed to be abandoning his exclusive claim to that
idea.</p>
<p>“If a man scatters money in the street, he does not thereby formally
relinquish title to it … but those who pick it up are thereafter
considered the rightful owners…. Similarly a man who reproduces his
writings by thousands and spreads them everywhere voluntarily abandons
his right of privacy and those who read them … no more put themselves by
the act under any obligation in regard to the author than those who pick
up scattered money put themselves under obligations to the
scatterer.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the essence of Tucker’s approach to intellectual property was
best expressed when he exclaimed, “You want your invention to yourself?
Then keep it to yourself.”<a href="#fn1517" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1517" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1517</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daily Bell: Why should the state enforce copyright on behalf of the
individual?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: It shouldn’t. In fact, the only thing the state
should do is commit suicide. Staticide. Whatever the word would be.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Why should disinterested third parties pay for copyright
enforcement?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: They shouldn’t and wouldn’t. The whole idea is
preposterous and flies in the face of human action. The market provides
abundance in the face of physical scarcity. It’s a good thing when we
are more productive. Likewise more information and knowledge is good. To
try to restrict the spread and use of knowledge is insane.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: If people want to claim copyright and third party
contracts, shouldn’t it be up to them to enforce those contracts?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Sure. But you can’t get IP from contracts. IP is an
<em>in rem</em> or <em>erga omnes</em> right—something good against the
world. Contractual rights are good only as between the parties—<em>in
personam</em>—and can never result in <em>in rem</em> IP rights. I’ve
explained this over and over.<a href="#fn1518" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1518" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1518</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: Is the US legal system—which is a state-run, “public”
judicial system—competent and fair in your estimation?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: No. It is thoroughly unjust and illegitimate. It is
just the facade of a criminal organization with a pretense to
legitimacy.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Why does the US have so many millions of prisoners, half
the world’s [prison] population?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Someone has to be first. But seriously—it’s partly
due to our insane war on drugs and also due to the devastation various
state (mostly federal) policies have imposed on the Black population:
minimum wage, welfare, inflation, unemployment, war, Jim Crow and other
vestiges of slavery.</p>
<p>And the US regularly uses IP as an excuse to engage in imperialistic
bullying of other nations, to benefit US industries such as Hollywood,
the music and software industries, big Pharma, and the like.<a
href="#fn1519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1519"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1519</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Bell: Is there a power elite intent on moving toward one-world
government, and are they behind copyright and patent laws?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: I used to be fearful of a one-world state, but my
current view is that the big powers, primarily the US, are the biggest
threat. But yes, the Western powers are using copyright and patent to
crack down on dissent and to influence other countries’ policies at the
behest of the MPAA, RIAA, and so on.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: What would be the best approach to socio-politics in your
view?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: As I explain in chapters 2 and 3, I am definitely
an anarchist—have been since 1988 or so. I prefer the term
“anarcho-libertarian” nowadays, in part because of confusion spread by
some left-libertarians about the connotations of “capitalism.” But I am
in favor of a free market and capitalism rightly understood. I am
basically a Rothbardian-Hoppean in terms of politics.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Do you think the Internet itself, via what we call the
Internet Reformation, is having a big impact on the powers-that-be and
their ability to control society and information?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: As some earlier answers have indicated—yes. The
Internet is one of the most significant developments in our lifetime,
perhaps in the history of humanity.<a href="#fn1520"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1520"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1520</sup></a> The state is trying to control
the Internet but I believe and hope that by the time the state is fully
roused to the danger the Internet poses to it, it will be too late for
it to stop it. As a <em>Salon</em> writer said about former
congressman/now copyright lobbyist Chris Dodd after the Internet
uprising that helped defeat the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA): “No
wonder Chris Dodd is so angry. The Internet is treating him like damage,
and routing around it.”<a href="#fn1521" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1521" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1521</sup></a> My hope is that
the Internet will find ways to treat the state like the cancerous damage
that it is, and route around it and leave it in the dust.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Where does the IP movement go now? What are the next
moves? Are you content with theorizing about it? Is it having a
real-world impact? What would that be?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Ultimately we have to try to highlight the illogic
and injustices of the system so that people realize IP is illegitimate.
This is an uphill battle, of course. Most people are unprincipled and
utilitarian, influenced by state propaganda and economically illiterate.
I have pondered trying to set up some kind of patent defense league but
have not yet figured out how viable this is.<a href="#fn1522"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1522"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1522</sup></a> I would also like to urge some
group like EFF or Creative Commons to come up with<br />
a simple, reliable, inexpensive way for people to abandon their
copyrights. At present there is no easy way to do this.<a href="#fn1523"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1523"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1523</sup></a> And though it is not prudent to
advocate that people flout the law, the widespread disregard for
copyright and resort to piracy, torrents, and encryption will put some
limits on how effective copyright enforcement can be.</p>
<p>Daily Bell: Any other points you want to make?</p>
<p>Stephan Kinsella: Let me close with a quote from Lew Rockwell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me state this as plainly as possible. The enemy is the state.
There are other enemies too, but none so fearsome, destructive,
dangerous, or culturally and economically debilitating. No matter what
other proximate enemy you can name—big business, unions, victim lobbies,
foreign lobbies, medical cartels, religious groups, classes, city
dwellers, farmers, left-wing professors, right-wing blue-collar workers,
or even bankers and arms merchants—none are as horrible as the hydra
known as the leviathan state. If you understand this point—and only this
point—you can understand the core of libertarian strategy.<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>1524</sup></a></p>

<p>Daily Bell: Any references, web sites, etc., you want to point
to?</p>

Book,</em> and I also have another book in the works, <em>Law in a
Libertarian World: Legal Foundations of a Free Society</em>, an edited
selection of my rights and law-related articles [note: this is now the

<h4 id="after-thoughts-1">After Thoughts</h4>
<p><em>by Anthony Wile</em></p>
<p>We thank Stephan Kinsella for this interview and for the work he has
done generally on this issue of copyright. Ideas have ramifications far
beyond their apparent initial non-acceptance. What seems impractical now
may be common sense tomorrow.</p>
<p>Human history seems to go in cycles. Right now we are seemingly at
the top of the totalitarian arc. Cold comfort to most, but there has
probably never been a time in human history when there was so much
hidden totalitarianism and when a cabal of individuals controlling Money
Power were likely making final moves to try to control the world</p>
<p>It is very hard to peer through the confusion purposefully laid by
the dynastic families that apparently control central banking (and thus
money) around the world. Monetary apologists are out in force these
days, claiming that various forms of government money are an antidote to
the abuse of mercantilism.</p>
<p>Of course, it is via mercantilism, the abuse of government laws and
regulations by private parties, that Money Power retains its clout. Only
by controlling the “democratic process” does a tiny group of people
retain their hold on the levers of government. Behind the scenes these
levers are pulled for their benefit. And <em>they</em> do the
pulling.</p>
<p>It is mercantilism, the use of public law to reinforce private
privilege, that bides at the base of Money Power. And those who are
behind Money Power, the assorted apologists and enablers, will use
<em>any</em> tool to buttress their privilege. Lately, in our view,
they’ve been behind the resurgence of Georgism, Greenbackerism, Social
Credit, and a number of other “movements” that claim “the people” need
to take back government.</p>
<p>Of course, it is improbable, these days anyway, that people can “take
back” their government. What is more likely is that the powers-that-be
are encouraging these movements because they provide a fertile
methodology for the continuance of mercantilism. Mercantilism is
impossible to apply in the absence of government.</p>
<p>But so long as public nostrums are being peddled, it is fairly easy
for Money Power to gain a foothold once again. This is why we are
proponents of laissez faire and libertarianism. The solution to the
problem of government is not to have more of it “properly controlled,”
but to have as <em>little</em> of it as possible. The less government
there is, the less feasible it is to abuse it.</p>
<p>People like Stephan Kinsella do us a great favor when it comes to
establishing this sort of argument. Any perspective that shows us how
laws and regulations provide artificial benefits to some at the expense
of others is of a larger benefit as well because it delegitimizes
force.</p>
<p>Force, in fact, is at the heart of government, any government. A
handful of people pass the laws that bind us to the state, and
generations to come as well. But Rothbardian libertarianism (and
Misesian libertarianism generally) has been all about providing an
alternative narrative to the force of the state.</p>
<p>Logically, Rothbard, Mises, and other Austrian economists have shown
us that force is the common currency of government and that voluntary,
free-market societies have existed in the past and are likely the better
alternative.</p>
<p>By opening up our minds to an alternative view of copyright, Kinsella
continues this process. You don’t have to agree with him, of course, and
we ourselves have proposed a simpler solution: If people want to enforce
copyright (or any other legal nostrum for that matter), let them do so
out of their own pocket. That would put an end to the regulatory state
in short order.</p>
<p>Beyond that, government doesn’t work on a logical level. Every law
and regulation, enforced by the threat of incarceration or even death,
fixes prices by transferring wealth from those who earn to those who
haven’t. The more price-fixing you have, the more unfair, disorderly,
and inefficient society becomes. Eventually, society falls apart
entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, in the West, one could argue we’re at that stage now.
Humans badly need new solutions. People need to understand that they
need to think for themselves and exercise their own “human action” in
order to help themselves and their families to survive as the world
continues its slow-motion spiral into depression and military
destruction.</p>
<p>People like Stephan Kinsella are indispensible to this process.
Austrian economics, generally, and the larger ambit of free-market
thinking it encourages, are necessary in providing us with alternatives
showing us that the current environment is not the “only
alternative.”</p>
<p>Whether you agree with Kinsella or not, we’re happy he’s around and
has presented such thought-provoking ideas. It’s people like Kinsella
with exciting new ways of looking at sociopolitical and economic issues
who provide us with a vision for the future. He is, in fact, part of the
so-called “great conversation.”</p>
<p>You can join it, too. Just study the great thinkers and come up with
your own ideas. If the ideas are interesting enough, people will start
to discuss them and write about them and respond to them. That’s how the
Austrian school succeeded and why its ideas are now part of the larger
economic dialogue.</p>
<p>We know it’s a real discipline because it builds on thousands of
years of economic history. Don’t let the sophists and the wily ones
distract you from the truth. As free-market thinking succeeds, they are
coming out in force. But the bottom line, unfortunately, is that
government is force, no matter the “law” it is enforcing.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no absolute freedom, and human beings are
innately tribal. But within this context, we choose to advocate for
freedom above all. One travels toward minarchism via rigorous anarchic
logic, not by advocating <em>more</em> government. We’re glad that
people like Kinsella give us additional intellectual tools to make
persuasive arguments for a less coercive society.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-1">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Hello. I’m glad to be here. Thank you to Ian and Mike for the
invitation. I do have my eleven-year-old son with me. It’s the second or
third time he’s seen me speak. He’s been to Auburn with me. I went to
the New York Comic Con with him on Thursday. So turnabout’s fair play
although it was fun. Comic Con was great.</p>
<p>I have fifteen minutes. My topic is “Libertarianism After Fifty
Years—What Have We Learned”? If I get cut off, I will continue this in a
private podcast. You can find more information, if I run out of time,
because this is a big topic for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>This is my own view of libertarianism. It might not be shared by
everyone here. But what I would like to talk about is—what is the
libertarian movement? How old is it? Where did we come from? What have
we learned, and what’s to come?</p>
<h4 id="the-modern-libertarian-movement1526">THE MODERN LIBERTARIAN
MOVEMENT<a href="#fn1526" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1526"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1526</sup></a></h4>
<p>In my view, the modern libertarian movement is only about five or six
decades old. The ideas that have influenced our greatest thinkers can be
traced back decades and centuries to previous movements and thinkers<a
href="#fn1527" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1527"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1527</sup></a>—to the Enlightenment, to
classical liberal thinkers, to thinkers from the Old Right, to
luminaries such as Hugo Grotius, John Locke, Thomas Paine, Herbert
Spencer, David Hume, and John Stuart Mill, and to more recent and
largely even more radical thinkers, such as Gustave de Molinari,
Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner, Bertrand de Jouvenel, Franz
Oppenheimer, and Albert Jay Nock.<a href="#fn1528" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1528" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1528</sup></a></p>
<p>The beginnings of the modern movement can be detected in the works of
the “three furies of libertarianism,” as Brian Doherty calls them: Rose
Wilder Lane, Ayn Rand, and Isabel Patterson, whose respective books,
<em>The Discovery of Freedom</em>, <em>The Fountainhead</em>, and
<em>The God of the Machine,</em> were all published, rather remarkably,
in the same year: 1943.<a href="#fn1529" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1529" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1529</sup></a> But in its more
modern form, libertarianism originated in the 1960s and 1970s from
thinkers based primarily in the United States, notably Ayn Rand and
Murray Rothbard. There’s a reason Jerome Tuccille’s hilarious satirical
memoir is entitled <em>It Usually Begins with Ayn Rand</em>.<a
href="#fn1530" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1530"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1530</sup></a> Other significant influences on
the nascent libertarian movement include Ludwig von Mises, author of
<em>Liberalism</em> (1927) and <em>Human Action</em> (1949, with a
predecessor version published in German in 1940); Nobel laureate F.A.
von Hayek, author of <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> (1944); Leonard Read,
head of the Foundation for Economic Education (founded 1946); and Nobel
laureate Milton Friedman, author of the influential <em>Capitalism and
Freedom</em> (1962).</p>
<p>The most prominent and influential of modern libertarian figures,
however, were novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand, the founder of
“Objectivism”—the political wing of which, dubbed “capitalism” by her,
is more or less co-extensive with libertarian minarchism—and a “radical
for capitalism”; and Murray Rothbard, the Mises-influenced libertarian
anarcho-capitalist economist and political theorist. Rothbard’s seminal
role is widely recognized, even by non-Rothbardians. Objectivist John
McCaskey, for example, has observed, that out of the debates in the
mid-1900s about what rights citizens ought to have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… grew the main sort of libertarianism of the last fifty years. It
was based on a principle articulated by Murray Rothbard in the 1970s
this way: No one may initiate the use or threat of physical violence
against the person or property of anyone else. The idea had roots in
John Locke, America’s founders, and more immediately Ayn Rand, but it
was Rothbard’s formulation that became standard. It became known as the
<em>non-aggression</em> principle or—since Rothbard took it as the
starting point of political theory and not the conclusion of
philosophical justification—the <em>non-aggression axiom</em>. In the
late twentieth century, anyone who accepted this principle could call
himself, or could find himself called, a libertarian, even if he
disagreed with Rothbard’s own insistence that rights are best protected
when there is no government at all.<a href="#fn1531"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1531"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1531</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can date the dawn of today’s libertarianism to the works of Rand
and Rothbard: to Rand’s <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> (1957), and to
Rothbard’s <em>Man, Economy, and State</em> (1962), <em>Power and
Market</em> (1970), and <em>For a New Liberty</em> (1973), plus his
journal <em>The Libertarian Forum</em> (1969–1984). <em>For a New
Liberty</em> stands today as a brilliant, and early, bold statement of
the radical libertarian vision. By the mid-60s, the modern libertarian
movement was coalescing, primarily behind the non-initiation of force
principle and the “radical capitalism” of Ayn Rand and Rothbard’s
systematic libertarian corpus based upon the non-aggression principle,
or axiom. It is no surprise that the Libertarian Party was founded in
1971, as these ideas, and the liberty movement, were gaining steam.</p>
<p>In the ensuing decades, many other influential works appeared
expounding on the libertarian idea.<a href="#fn1532"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1532"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1532</sup></a></p>
<p>So the movement is about fifty or sixty years old. It’s a relatively
young movement as far as ideologies and political philosophies go. We
still have our disagreements over certain controversies like abortion
and other issues. But a lot of progress has been made in the last fifty
years. We’ve had a lot of development, partly because of incessant
libertarian internal debate, criticism by outsiders, criticism by
minarchists, criticism by insiders. But at the fifty year stage, I do
think it is a good time to step back and reflect and think what have we
learned over the last fifty years. How we could use this going forward
to further <em>refine</em> and <em>develop</em> our ideas.</p>
<h4 id="what-has-become-clearer">WHAT HAS BECOME CLEARER</h4>
<p>So let’s talk first about what has become clearer in the last fifty
years. And, again, not everyone is going to agree with this—but this is
my take. My take is from the position of an Austrian and anarchist
influenced libertarian; from someone influenced greatly by Rothbard,
Mises, Ayn Rand—and Hans-Hermann Hoppe, whom I regard as the greatest
living libertarian theorist and Austrian economist.</p>
<p>This first insight may not be the most popular with everyone here,
but I think the one thing we’ve learned is that political activism as a
primary means of progress is limited at best.<a href="#fn1533"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1533"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1533</sup></a> I don’t want to discourage people
from doing it, but not everyone agrees with voting or that electoral
politics is the way to go.<a href="#fn1534" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1534" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1534</sup></a> And the sort of
sorry history and state of the Libertarian Party since
1971—incompetence, corruption, and inefficacy—shows that electoral
politics has not succeeded very much so far.<a href="#fn1535"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1535"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1535</sup></a></p>
<p>I would also say that we’ve learned that a <em>principled</em>
libertarian position is preferred over an <em>ad hoc</em> or single
purpose one like NORML or marijuana legalization or a utilitarian
approach. Those have their purpose. They have their role. But a
principled approach is superior and necessary. You really need to have a
love for liberty, a love for libertarianism. You have to believe that
aggression is really wrong, not just impractical.<a href="#fn1536"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1536"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1536</sup></a></p>
<p>It has become clear that libertarianism has to be 100% anti-war, not
merely against “unjust” wars—as even Rothbard said, in the history of
America, there have only been two “just” wars: the Revolutionary War and
the war to prevent the independence of the South. We need to condemn
both of those wars, the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, on both the
South’s and the North’s side. These are both wars waged by the
state.</p>
<p>In the case of the Revolutionary War, it was a war that involved
conscription, shooting deserters, tons of war crimes, taxation,
inflation.<a href="#fn1537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1537"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1537</sup></a> And it resulted in the current
state that we have now. The American Revolution was a failure as well.<a
href="#fn1538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1538"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1538</sup></a></p>
<p>Libertarianism is <em>anti-state,</em> or at least it is increasingly
becoming so.<a href="#fn1539" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1539"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1539</sup></a> There’s an increasing number of
libertarians and an increasing number of those that get drawn to
anarchy. What’s the old joke? “What’s the difference between a
minarchist and an anarchist? About six months.” To be against
aggression, you have to be against <em>all</em> aggression: private
aggression, that is, crime, and public aggression, or institutional
aggression, which is what the state always does.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is <em>radical</em>. It’s not incremental. There is
nothing wrong with being incremental, but libertarianism is really a
<em>radical</em> doctrine. And it’s also <em>unique</em> and radical and
different from, and superior to, the Left and the Right. We have to
recognize that. We’re not “of the Left.” We’re not “of the Right.”</p>
<p>Also, libertarianism is now increasingly, overwhelmingly,
anti-intellectual property.<a href="#fn1540" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1540" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1540</sup></a> Intellectual
property, patent and copyright law, and related laws like trademark and
trade secret used to be the boring province of specialists and policy
wonks, but with the advent of the internet and the increase of global
trade and high tech, the so-called “abuses” of patent and copyright law
have become evident to all of us.</p>
<p>We have to realize that <em>intellectual property</em> is one of the
top five or six horrible things the state does to society. After war,
public education, the drug war, central banking, taxation—intellectual
property is up there.<a href="#fn1541" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1541" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1541</sup></a> It’s one of the
worst things that helps support the police state and suppress individual
liberties and reduce innovation and impose hundreds of billions of
dollars of cost on the globe every year.<a href="#fn1542"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1542"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1542</sup></a> This kind of view upsets a lot of
the old guard libertarians, Objectivists and minarchists and
utilitarians and “Constitutionalists,” who still attempt to defend IP …
but modern libertarians, left libertarians, tech libertarians, young
people, people who actually “use the Internet”—they all know that
there’s something wrong with a law that prevents you from
<em>learning</em> and sharing in what we call, in the free market,
“competition.” There’s nothing wrong with competition!</p>
<p>Another thing we’ve learned in the last fifty years, due to the work
of writers like Bruno Leoni, Hayek, others: legislation is not the way
to make law. Law has to arise from custom, from contract, from
agreement, from decentralized processes like the common law or
arbitration.<a href="#fn1543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1543"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1543</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, I think we’ve learned, due to the work primarily of
Hans-Hermann Hoppe and others … we’ve had to recognize that democracy
was not a step on the road to progress towards a libertarian society.
Moving from monarchies in the ancient regimes to democracy might have
been better in some ways, but it wasn’t unambiguously better, and it’s
definitely not a simulation of a libertarian or a liberal society.<a
href="#fn1544" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1544"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1544</sup></a></p>
<p>And along those lines I think we also have to recognize that we need
to quit thinking of America as some kind of proto-libertarian paradise
back in the day of the Founders. The Constitution is not libertarian. It
was a centralizing document. It was a power grab. It failed… or rather,
it <em>succeeded</em> in what it was really meant to do, which is to
centralize power in the hands of the federal government.<a
href="#fn1545" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1545"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1545</sup></a> So we need to wipe these
illusions from our eyes about the American Founders being
proto-libertarians. They were not. The Constitution is not libertarian.
America was not a libertarian country early on. There’s any number of
victim classes you could ask, and they would probably agree with
this.</p>
<p>Another thing that has become clear, just in recent years, has been
the libertarian approach to peace and cooperation as informing the
issueof children. That is, there has been a reexamination of how we rear
our children, how we discipline children and how we educate children.
Thus we have the rise of the anti-spanking and the “peaceful parenting”
movement. And we have an increasing resort to homeschooling and even
so-called unschooling. So these are all things that we are starting to
learn.<a href="#fn1546" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1546"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1546</sup></a></p>
<p>The two most important things I think that have become clear—and some
of these were known to earlier thinkers before—number one is the
importance of a solid understanding of economics to inform your case.
And I think that means Austrian Economics.<a href="#fn1547"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1547"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1547</sup></a> You have to be economically
literate. And the rise in the popularity of Austrian Economics has been
stunning to see.<a href="#fn1548" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1548"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1548</sup></a> There is a reason for that. You
don’t see the Chicago school or the Coasean school being passionately
argued for by most libertarians now.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important point, it has become clear, and we need
to return to this and emphasize this, libertarianism is essentially
<em>about property rights</em>. That’s really what it’s all about.<a
href="#fn1549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1549"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1549</sup></a> Liberty is a consequence of
property rights. It’s what you can do when your property rights are
respected.</p>
<h4 id="issues-that-divide-or-confuse">ISSUES THAT DIVIDE OR
CONFUSE</h4>
<p>Now there are still some issues that divide or confuse us. There is
this left vs. right debate.<a href="#fn1550" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1550" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1550</sup></a> Are we of the
left? Or are we of the right? There is the thick vs. thin debate. Should
we be thick libertarians or thin libertarians?</p>
<p>There’s the debate whether we should be activists or whether we
should be theorists or whether we should just mind our own business and
not work for the state.<a href="#fn1551" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1551" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1551</sup></a></p>
<p>There are esoteric issues like voluntary slavery. Should I be able to
sign a contract and sell my kidneys, or myself? This is the alienability
issue.<a href="#fn1552" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1552"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1552</sup></a></p>
<p>There is sometimes debate about whether you should be responsible for
the actions of others. I have had people tell me that Adolf Hitler
really never pulled the trigger, so he really didn’t commit murder.<a
href="#fn1553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1553"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1553</sup></a> Only the henchmen are guilty.
Truman didn’t really drop the bomb on Japan. A mafia boss doesn’t
actually pull the trigger. His hit man does. So you have this kind of
confusion, I would say.</p>
<p>And on the topic of intellectual property, even though libertarians
are largely moving in our direction on this—there is still widespread
confusion among people about this issue.</p>
<p>And there is also still confusion about the basis and the nature of
property rights; about utilitarianism or consequentialism vs.
deontological or natural rights thinking vs. intuitionism vs. Popperian
conjecturalism.<a href="#fn1554" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1554"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1554</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="danger-of-unclear-language-and-metaphors">DANGER OF UNCLEAR
LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS</h4>
<p>Now one reason for this confusion is the lack of careful attention to
speaking clearly, thinking clearly, and being aware of the danger of the
use of metaphors.<a href="#fn1555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1555"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1555</sup></a> When libertarianism arose in the
middle of the last century, it was so much superior to the prevailing
thought that we could speak in sloppy terms. It was still better, even
with imprecise language. After all, our competitors also employed, and
still employ, vague and nonrigorous terms. But even though the
libertarian approach seems obviously superior to statist alternatives,
even in its early days, as it gets applied to more and more issues,
harder issues arise and the older ways of thinking and reasoning don’t
always suffice. We need to revisit our foundations and we need to think
more carefully about this.</p>
<p>Let me give some examples of metaphors or uncareful use of terms,
things that can lead to equivocation by our opponents, things that can
lead to confusion when we try to analyze difficult issues.</p>
<p>So one is, for example, most libertarians have always been against
what we call “public schools.” And in recent years, maybe in the last
decade or two, I’ve heard libertarians say, they’ve used the term
“government schools,” because they want to make clear, “I’m against
government schools.” They’re trying to call to the attention of the
proponents of “public” schools that they’re really in favor of the
<em>government</em> being in charge of educating people.</p>
<p>Well, even the word “government,” in my view, is a dangerous word to
use. I use it from time to time but I increasingly try to use the word
“state” to make it clear that I’m against <em>the state</em> because the
state has a definition. It’s a monopoly in a geographic area over the
provision of law, justice, and force.<a href="#fn1556"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1556"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1556</sup></a> The word government has ambiguous
meanings. And your opponent—either a minarchist, which we can call a
mini-statist, or a regular statist—by the word government, they mean the
governing institutions in society. And they also use it as an equivalent
to the state because they believe the state is necessary for these
governing institutions. So they are smuggling in their presuppositions,
a type of question-begging.</p>
<p>So if you say, as an anarchist, I’m against the government (meaning:
against the state), they will take you to mean you’re against law and
order. So if they ask you, “Well, do you believe in law?”</p>
<p>You say, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Then they say, “Well, then you believe in government.”</p>
<p>And I say, “Well, I believe in government as law and order.”</p>
<p>And then they say, “Well, then you must believe in the state.”</p>
<p>You see there’s that trick there. So we have to stay focused on being
opposed to the state, defined in a certain way.</p>
<p>Here’s another one. It’s the use of the word aggression in sloppy
ways. Some libertarians, or some of our opponents, will use it just to
mean force. So they’ll say, “Well even you guys aren’t against
aggression. You believe in force to defend yourself.”</p>
<p>Well, aggression is the <em>initiation</em> of force. And then you
see other sloppy terminology, like I’m against “the initiation of
aggression.” Well, that’s saying I’m against the initiation of the
initiation of force. It’s just not clear terminology.</p>
<p>Another one, it’s just a little issue, is the word “coercion.”
Coercion technically means the use of the threat of force to compel
someone to do something. Now just like force or violence, which is
sometimes justified if it’s used defensively, coercion can be justified
sometimes too. If I coerce a guy trying to rob me, there’s nothing wrong
with that. So we should quit using the word coercion as a synonym for
aggression.<a href="#fn1557" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1557"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1557</sup></a> And we should never refer to
defensive force as aggression.</p>
<p>There is also the labor theory of property and its close cousin, the
labor theory of value.<a href="#fn1558" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1558" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1558</sup></a> This is what I
think the fundamental mistake in a lot of libertarian thinking is, which
is what led to intellectual property, and it also led to communism and
the deaths of tens of millions of people in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.<a href="#fn1559" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1559"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1559</sup></a> It all started with John Locke
who was responding to Filmer and understandably used this labor
metaphor. But we have to stop thinking of labor as a special thing (it’s
just a type of action), and we have to get rid of this confused idea
that we own our labor. You don’t own your labor. Labor is what you do
with something you own: your body. (You don’t own your “self” by the
way. That’s another vague term. You own your body.)<a href="#fn1560"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1560"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1560</sup></a></p>
<p>Property rights are rights to control scarce, or conflictable,
resources in the world. These are the only <em>things that can be
conflicted over</em>. Your body is an example, and other things in the
world are examples. Property rules <em>always</em> specify the owner of
that thing. Owning your body is <em>sufficient</em> to allow you to act
as you please, but it doesn’t mean you “own your actions.” It doesn’t
mean you “own your labor.” If you start thinking this way, you’re going
to get to intellectual property. This is what results. I own my labor. I
own what I mix it with. I own my labor. I own whatever it creates that
“has” “value.” But there are no property rights in value, as
Hans-Hermann Hoppe has pointed out. I could elaborate, but I would run
out of time.<a href="#fn1561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1561"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1561</sup></a></p>
<p>Another issue is the word “contract.” Libertarians are confused by
contract. Rothbard and Bill Evers have written revolutionary work on
this topic, viewing contract as the exercise of property rights in
resources that are owned. It is not an “enforceable promise.” That way
of thinking leads also to confused conclusions like debtor’s prison
which leads to the idea of voluntary slavery, etc.<a href="#fn1562"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1562"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1562</sup></a></p>
<p>Another one is the word “fraud.”<a href="#fn1563"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1563"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1563</sup></a> Libertarians throw this word,
fraud, around a lot, especially advocates of intellectual property; also
the word plagiarism. They totally confuse fraud, contract, plagiarism,
property rights, labor theory of value, and patent and copyright law.<a
href="#fn1564" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1564"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1564</sup></a> They mix them together into a big
gumbo of confusion. And, you know, they’ll imply that if you’re against
patent law then you’re in favor of fraud or you’re in favor of
dishonesty or you’re not in favor of giving someone attribution for
their ideas. These are all confused, and they’re all disingenuous
usually, or they’re said in total ignorance of what these terms mean and
how the law really works and what property rights really are.</p>
<p>There’s another confusion, which is the common paired set of
expressions which everyone takes for granted. There are two paired
notions. “If you own something, well, you can sell it”—which is wrong
actually. “And if you sell something, that must mean you had to own it
to sell it.” That’s also wrong.<a href="#fn1565" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1565" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1565</sup></a> Those ideas lead
to the idea of voluntary slavery on the one hand<a href="#fn1566"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1566"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1566</sup></a> and the idea of intellectual
property on the other. And I’ve taken those apart in other contexts as
well. I can revisit them at some point when I have more time.</p>
<p>Now another source of confusion is the idea about where property
rights come from and the idea that just because we believe that the
first user of an unowned resource, like Locke’s idea of original
appropriation or homesteading—just because we believe he is the proper
owner of that resource, that because there’s been this “original sin” or
this “taint” of property titles throughout human history, because we can
rarely trace our title to a resource back to the original owner, back to
Adam, let’s say, then that means our entire theory of property rights is
flawed. And then what’s the next step? Then we’re going to say, well, we
are going to have to have redistribution someday. The current allocation
of resources, the property rights that the rich have, really came from
conquests 700 years ago. So no one is really entitled to their wealth.
“You didn’t build that,” as Obama might say. And that when we have a
libertarian revolution, a left-libertarian revolution, we need to
redistribute these titles and everyone is going to be equal.
Egalitarianism is driving these people.<a href="#fn1567"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1567"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1567</sup></a></p>
<p>So whenever I hear someone say that there’s something wrong with your
theory of property, I hold on to my wallet, because I know they’re
coming after it. The people that condemn materialism and rich people and
money always want your money. So you have to be very wary of these
people.<a href="#fn1568" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1568"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1568</sup></a></p>
<p>Now there’s another related problem which afflicts a lot of
quasi-left libertarians, and that is this idea that if you are in favor
of property rights, you’re really in favor of “aggression.” Now, how do
they come up with this idea? Basically, they don’t believe in
<em>ownership</em>. They believe that if you are using a resource that
you have the right to use it in an undisturbed fashion, but as soon as
you set it down and walk away, it’s up for grabs. And if you maintain
the right to use force to retrieve your resource, or to get damages from
them for damaging or using your property, you’re committing
aggression.<a href="#fn1569" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1569"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1569</sup></a> This is obviously confused and
unlibertarian.</p>
<h4 id="moving-forward">MOVING FORWARD</h4>
<p>So this is the fundamental problem that we need to focus on here. We
need to understand that aggression is not the fundamental concept of
libertarianism. Aggression is a shorthand description of our view of
property rights. Every political philosophy, every person on the planet,
has an implicit or explicit view of property rights. Because property
rights arise only because we live in a world of scarcity, a world of
scarce resources, which means a world where <em>conflict is
possible</em>.<a href="#fn1570" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1570"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1570</sup></a> If you understand Mises’s
praxeology and his analysis of human action and how human action is the
purposeful employment of scarce means—things that are <em>causally
efficacious</em> in the world to achieve your end, <em>guided</em> by
your knowledge (which is why there are no property rights in ideas)<a
href="#fn1571" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1571"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1571</sup></a>—then you’ll understand that
property rights are <em>always</em> the right to control a given
resource. It’s about that.<a href="#fn1572" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1572" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1572</sup></a></p>
<p>Aggression is just a <em>shorthand</em> for our particular view of
how property should be assigned.<a href="#fn1573" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1573" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1573</sup></a> Communists,
socialists, liberals, environmentalists all believe in a certain
allocation of property rights. They believe the state should own the
property or maybe the poor people should own the property. So the
question is what makes libertarianism unique? It is our <em>particular
property allocation scheme</em>.<a href="#fn1574" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1574" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1574</sup></a></p>
<p>And I will conclude by just summarizing the way I think we need to
view the libertarian paradigm and how, if you think about it
consistently, it will answer all the questions I just went through that
are confusing to people. That is this: the rule of libertarianism is
very simple. It is that when two or more people—because if you only have
only one person, then there’s no dispute, there’s no problem to be
solved; there is no social problem—when two or more people both want to
use a given resource, when there is a possible dispute or conflict, the
question is simply, for the resource in question: which of those two or
more people has the better claim to the resource?</p>
<p>We answer that question by resorting to some very simple and common
sense and almost undeniably true rules.<a href="#fn1575"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1575"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1575</sup></a> In the case of a person’s body,
which is a resource over which there can be dispute, the rule is
self-ownership, or self-body-ownership: each person is the presumptive
owner of his own body. We oppose slavery, which is “other-ownership” and
instead favor self-ownership. Controversial, I know.</p>
<p>And as for previously-unowned, external resources, the types of
things that can serve as scarce means of action, there are three simple
rules. The first one is: who had it first? Or as between those two, who
had it first as far as we know? You don’t have to trace back to Adam.
You can trace it back to a common ancestor as the law has it.<a
href="#fn1576" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1576"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1576</sup></a> This is original appropriation,
or homesteading. This has to be the basic property allocation rule,
because for people to survive, they must use resources, and there must
be a first user. His use has to be rightful if we are to have ownership
and property rights as a concept distinct from mere possession.</p>
<p>Second: was there a consensual transfer from an owner to someone
else? That’s contract, or contractual title transfer.</p>
<p>And third: did one person harm the other, commit a tort or a crime,
so that he owes compensation or rectification or restitution to the
other guy, leading to a transfer of money or some resource from one guy
to the other.</p>
<p>So if you look at those three principles, that will tell you who owns
the resource in question. If I had it first, I am the
owner—<em>unless</em> I gave it to someone else, and then they own it.
They have a better claim than me. Every other philosophy, other than
libertarianism, violates one of those three rules. They ultimately
believe that someone has the right to a resource even though they didn’t
obtain it by contract, even though they weren’t harmed by the previous
owner, and even though they may have never found the resource or started
using it and put it to productive use.</p>
<p>Basically every philosophy, other than libertarianism, believes
either in a lawless world, a world of might makes right—or in some form
of slavery: owning the products of other people’s efforts or owning
their bodies.<a href="#fn1577" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1577"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1577</sup></a> That is why libertarianism is
superior. And if we focus on property rights and this foundational view
of looking at things, it helps us to move forward and improve the
libertarian project. Thank you.</p>

term “axiom,” no doubt inspired by Ayn Rand’s idiosyncratic use of the
term axiom) prohibits the initiation of force against the person <em>or
property</em> of someone else—<em>or threats</em> thereof, <em>or
fraud</em>. Some libertarians or libertarian critics argue that trespass
to owned resources, fraud, and threats do not quite fit into the NAP
because these things are not actually “aggression,” as the term is
properly understood. (See, e.g., the criticisms of libertarianism for
being unable to explain why fraud may be prohibited, by James Child and
Benjamin Ferguson, as discussed in “A Libertarian Theory of Contract”
(ch. 9), Part III.E. The NAP in a literal sense prohibits hitting or
using someone’s body (“aggression”) without their permission, which
implies self- or body-ownership. Thus, the NAP implies self-ownership,
and vice-versa. They are merely different ways of expressing the same
view: owning one’s body implies that aggression against it is
impermissible; the prohibition against aggression implies
self/body-ownership. (See also “On Libertarian Legal Theory,
Self-Ownership and Drug Laws” (ch. 23).)</p>
<p>The rationale for body-ownership, however, is extended by
libertarians to develop similar property rights in external resources;
and also to prohibit threats and fraud. (See ibid.) Thus, in my view,
the term “nonaggression principle” is an acceptable shorthand for basic
libertarian property rights principles—self-ownership plus ownership of
external resources based on original appropriation, and fraud and
threats—as long as it is kept in mind that in literal terms it refers to
body-ownership and that the other property rights are extensions of and
based on this primary property right. See also Kinsella, “Aggression and

Style, the Socialism of Conservatism, the Socialism of Social
Engineering, see Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</em>,
chaps. 3–6. Recognizing the common elements of various forms of
socialism and their distinction from libertarianism (capitalism), Hoppe
incisively defines socialism as “an institutionalized interference with
or aggression against private property and private property claims.”

<li id="fn35"><p> Even the private thief, by taking your watch, is
implicitly acting on the maxim that <em>he</em> has the right to control
it—that he is its owner. He does not deny property rights—he simply
differs from the libertarian as to <em>who the owner is</em>. In fact,
as Adam Smith observed: “If there is any society among robbers and
murderers, they must at least, according to the trite observation,
abstain from robbing and murdering one another.” Adam Smith, <em>The
Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, [1759]

<li id="fn36"><p> As Hoppe points out in the Foreword, regarding the
principle of “<em>private property and original appropriation</em>:
Logically, what is required to avoid all conflict regarding external
material objects used or usable as means of action, i.e. as goods, is
clear: every good must always and at all times be owned privately, i.e.
controlled exclusively by some specified person.”</p>
<p>Note also that it is <em>only</em> scarce (conflictable) things that
can be owned, that is, be the subject of property rights. For example,
as noted in the section <em>“IP Rights as Negative Easements”</em> in
“<em>Against Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years” (ch. 15),
information or knowledge (recipes, in general), as a non-scarce,
non-conflictable thing, <em>cannot</em> be owned; any law
<em>purporting</em> to assign property rights in such things is just a
<em>disguised</em> reassignment of property rights in existing
conflictable resources (money, factories, printing presses, etc).<a
href="#fnref36" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p> As Hoppe observes, even in a paradise with a
superabundance of goods:</p>
<p>every person’s physical body would still be a scarce resource and
thus the need for the establishment of property rules, i.e., rules
regarding people’s bodies, would exist. One is not used to thinking of
one’s own body in terms of a scarce good, but in imagining the most
ideal situation one could ever hope for, the Garden of Eden, it becomes
possible to realize that one’s body is indeed the prototype of a scarce
good for the use of which property rights, i.e., rights of exclusive
ownership, somehow have to be established, in order to avoid
clashes.</p>

anyone in particular; (2) <em>transfer</em>, that is, the passing of
property (that is to say, property rights) from one rightholder to

restoring just distributions of property when they have been upset by

Intellectual</em>, quoted in “Physical Force” entry, <em>The Ayn Rand
Lexicon: Objectivism from A to Z</em>, Harry Binswanger, ed. (New York:
New American Library, 1986; https://perma.cc/L4YA-96CC). Ironically,
Objectivists often excoriate libertarians for having a “contextless”
concept of aggression—that is, that “aggression” or “rights” is
meaningless unless these concepts are embedded in the larger
philosophical framework of Objectivism—despite Galt’s straightforward,
physicalist definition of aggression as the initiation of physical force
against others. In “Q&amp;A on Libertarianism,” <em>The Ayn Rand
Lexicon</em>
(http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-ideas/ari-q-and-a-on-libertarianism.html),
for example, (someone at) the Ayn Rand Institute writes:</p>
<p>The “libertarians,” in this usage of the term, plagiarize Ayn Rand’s
non-initiation of force principle and convert it into an axiom, denying
the need for and relevance of philosophical fundamentals—not only the
underlying ethics, but also the underlying metaphysics and
epistemology…. libertarianism declares that the value of liberty and the
evil of initiating force are self-evident primaries, needing no
justification or even explanation—leaving undefined such key concepts as
“liberty,” “force,” “justice,” “good,” and “evil.” It claims
compatibility with all views in metaphysics, epistemology, and
ethics—even subjectivism, mysticism, skepticism, altruism, and
nihilism—substituting “hate the state” for intellectual content.</p>
<p>See also Peter Schwartz, “Libertarianism: The Perversion of Liberty,”
in Ayn Rand, <em>The Voice of Reason: Essays in Objectivist Thought</em>
(Meridian, 1990) and the “Libertarians” entry in The Ayn Rand Lexicon
(http://aynrandlexicon.com/).</p>
<p>But as noted above, Rand own’s formulation in support of the NAP—“no
man may <em>initiate</em>—do you hear me? No man may <em>start</em>—the
use of physical force against others”—relies on rudimentary concepts
like physical force and the initiation thereof, which do not really
require much explanation; rather, her theory builds on these fairly
uncontroversial concepts. Just as her theory can use these basic
concepts as building blocks, libertarians can coherently use these
principles in articulating what we oppose, without lapsing into
subjectivism, nihilism, etc. People can communicate with language
without adopting the whole of Objectivism, after all. See also Walter
Block’s response to Schwartz: “Libertarianism vs. Objectivism: A

<em>idem</em>, “Property and Criminality,” in <em>idem</em>, <em>The
Ethics of Liberty</em>: “The fundamental axiom of libertarian theory is
that each person must be a self-owner, and that no one has the right to
interfere with such self-ownership” (p. 60), and “What … aggressive
violence means is that one man invades the property of another without
the victim’s consent. The invasion may be against a man’s property in
his person (as in the case of bodily assault), or against his property
in tangible goods (as in robbery or trespass)” (p. 45). Hoppe
writes:</p>
<p>If … an action is performed that uninvitedly invades or changes the
physical integrity of another person’s body and puts this body to a use
that is not to this very person’s own liking, this action … is called
<em>aggression</em>…. Next to the concept of action, <em>property</em>
is the most basic category in the social sciences. As a matter of fact,
all other concepts to be introduced in this chapter—aggression,
contract, capitalism and socialism—are definable in terms of property:
<em>aggression</em> being aggression against property, <em>contract</em>
being a nonaggressive relationship between property owners,
<em>socialism</em> being an institutionalized policy of aggression
against property, and <em>capitalism</em> being an institutionalized
policy of the recognition of property and contractualism.</p>

<p>In earlier years of the modern libertarian movement (see
“Libertarianism After Fifty Years: What Have We Learned?” (ch. 25);
Kinsella, “Foreword,” in Chase Rachels, <em>A Spontaneous Order: The
Capitalist Case For A Stateless Society</em> (2015;
https://archive.org/details/ASpontaneousOrder0)), what most libertarians
now refer to as the non-aggression principle was sometimes called the
non-aggression axiom, probably because of Rand’s somewhat idiosyncratic
use of the term axiom in her philosophy. See “Axioms” entry <em>The Ayn
Rand Lexicon</em> (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/axioms.html).
Rothbard himself, who was initially heavily influenced by Rand,
sometimes uses this phraseology, as can be seen in the passages quoted
above. Not all libertarians believe the NAP is “axiomatic” in Rand’s
sense—a proposition that is self-evidently true because its denial
results in contradiction—but all consistent and coherent libertarians
oppose the legitimacy of aggression, for whatever reasons, and thus
favor the non-aggression <em>principle</em> (i.e., self-ownership), at

for the hypothetical basic norm or rule that serves as the basis or
ultimate source for the legitimacy of a legal system. See Hans Kelsen,
<em>General Theory of Law and State</em>, Anders Wedberg, trans.
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1949). I employ this term
to refer to the fundamental norms presupposed by civilized people, e.g.,
in argumentative discourse, which in turn imply libertarian norms.</p>
<p><em>That</em> the libertarian <em>grundnorms</em> are, in fact,
necessarily presupposed by all civilized people to the extent they are
civilized—during argumentative justification, that is—is shown by Hoppe

punishment is justified. They want to be able to punish
legitimately—hence the interest in punishment theories….Theories of
punishment are concerned with justifying punishment, with offering
decent people who are reluctant to act immorally a reason why they may
punish others. This is useful, of course, for offering moral people
guidance and assurance that they may properly deal with those who seek
to harm them.<a href="#fnref50" class="footnote-back"

<p>Nozick’s subscription to the asymmetry thesis is evident in his

comparable account of how one can become the owner—morally speaking—of
one’s own—nonmorally speaking—mind and body. Absent special
circumstances, such as organ theft, one simply starts owning oneself.
Similarly, Otsuka thinks that ownership of external things is
conditional upon the satisfaction of an egalitarian proviso enjoining
equal opportunities for welfare; he assumes that ownership of oneself is
not conditional in this sense.</p>

these <em>personal resources</em>. Most versions of libertarianism also
allow people to gain moral ownership over natural resources (i.e.,
non-personal resources)—such as land, minerals, water, air, etc. We may
call these <em>external resources</em>. While the rights to our personal
resources are natural and thus <em>in need of no acquisition, the rights

<li id="fn55"><p> “Original appropriation” is the broader concept for
the acquisition of previously-unowned scarce (conflictable) resources,
including land or realty (immovables), while “homesteading” is sometimes
used as a subset of original appropriation that involves immovables
(land), such as a “homestead.” However, homesteading is often used more
generally and in this book I often use “homesteading” synonymously with
original appropriation to refer to appropriation of any type of unowned,
conflictable resource, whether movable or immovable.</p>
<p>On the nature of appropriation of unowned scarce resources, see
Hoppe’s and de Jasay’s ideas quoted and discussed in Kinsella, “Thoughts
on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas,” and note 32, below. In
particular, see Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</em>,
pp. 24, 160–62, 169–71; and Anthony de Jasay, <em>Against Politics: On
Government, Anarchy, and Order</em> (London &amp; New York: Routledge,
1997), pp. 158 <em>et seq.</em>, 171 <em>et seq., et pass</em>. De Jasay
is also discussed extensively in “Review of Anthony de Jasay,
<em>Against Politics: On Government, Anarchy, and Order</em>” (ch. 20).
De Jasay’s argument presupposes the value of justice, efficiency, and
order. Given these goals, he argues for three principles of politics:
(1) <em>if in doubt, abstain from political action</em> (pp. 147 <em>et
seq.</em>); (2) <em>the feasible is presumed free</em> (pp. 158 <em>et
seq.</em>); and (3) <em>let exclusion stand</em> (pp. 171 <em>et
seq.</em>). In connection with principle (3), “let exclusion stand,” de
Jasay offers insightful comments about the nature of homesteading or
appropriation of unowned goods. De Jasay equates property with its
owner’s “excluding” others from using it, for example by enclosing or
fencing in immovable property (land) or finding or creating (and
keeping) movable property (corporeal, tangible objects). He concludes
that since an appropriated thing has no other owner, <em>prima
facie</em> no one is entitled to object to the first possessor claiming
ownership. Thus, the principle means “let ownership stand,” i.e., that
claims to ownership of property appropriated from the state of nature or
acquired ultimately through a chain of title tracing back to such an
appropriation should be respected. This is consistent with Hoppe’s
defense of the “natural” theory of property. Hoppe, <em>A Theory of
Socialism and Capitalism</em>, pp. 20–24 &amp; chap. 7. For further
discussion of the nature of appropriation, see Jörg Guido Hülsmann, “The

Kinsella, “Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas”; “Defending
Argumentation Ethics” (ch. 7), the section “Objective Links: First Use,

further discussion of the necessity of objective property rules that can
determine what resources may be used <em>now</em>, without having to
wait for the approval of latecomers, see “How We Come To Own Ourselves”
(ch. 4), n.14 and accompanying text.</p>
<p>See also, in this connection, de Jasay, <em>Against Politics</em>,
further discussed and quoted in Kinsella, “Thoughts on the Latecomer and
Homesteading Ideas,” as well as in “Review of Anthony de Jasay,
<em>Against Politics</em>” (ch. 20). See also de Jasay’s argument (note
27, above) that since an appropriated thing has no other owner,
<em>prima facie</em> no one is entitled to object to the first possessor
claiming ownership. De Jasay’s “let exclusion stand” idea, along with
the Hoppean emphasis on the prior-later distinction, sheds light on the
nature of homesteading itself. Often the question is asked as to what
types of acts constitute or are sufficient for homesteading (or
“embordering” as Hoppe sometimes refers to it); what type of “labor”
must be “mixed with” a thing; and to what property does the homesteading
extend? What “counts” as “sufficient” homesteading? We can see that the
answer to these questions is related to the issue of what is the thing
in dispute. In other words, if <em>B</em> claims ownership of a thing
possessed (or formerly possessed) by <em>A</em>, then the very framing
of the dispute helps to identify what the thing is in dispute, and what
counts as possession of it. If <em>B</em> claims ownership of a given
resource, he wants the right to control it, to a certain extent, and
according to its nature. Then the question becomes, did someone else
previously control “it” (whatever is in dispute), according to its
nature; i.e., did someone else already homestead it, so that <em>B</em>
is only a latecomer? This ties in with de Jasay’s “let exclusion stand”
principle, which rests on the idea that if someone is actually able to
control a resource such that others are excluded, then this exclusion
should “stand.” Of course, the physical nature of a given scarce
resource and the way in which humans use such resources will determine
the nature of actions needed to “control” it and exclude others. See

<li id="fn96"><p> Another point: In my view, we are about as likely to
achieve minarchy as we are to achieve anarchy. I.e., both are remote
possibilities. What is striking is that almost every criticism of
“impracticality” that minarchists hurl at anarchy is also true of
minarchy itself. Both are exceedingly unlikely. Both require massive
changes in views among millions of people. Both rest on presumptions
that most people simply don’t care much about.<a href="#fnref96"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn97"><p> Though the case for anarchy does not depend on its
likelihood or “feasibility,” any more than the case against private
crime depends on there never being any acts of crime, anarchy is clearly
possible. There is anarchy among nations, for example. There is also
anarchy within government, as pointed out in a seminal and neglected JLS
article by Alfred G. Cuzán, which argues that even the government itself
is in anarchy, internally—the President does not literally force others
in government to obey his commands, after all; they obey them
voluntarily, due to a recognized, hierarchical structure. Government’s
(political) anarchy is not a good anarchy, but it demonstrates anarchy
is possible—indeed, that we never really get out of it. See Alfred G.
Cuzán, “Do We Ever Really Get Out of Anarchy?,” <em>J. Libertarian
Stud.</em> 3, no. 2 (Summer 1979;
https://mises.org/library/do-we-ever-really-get-out-anarchy): 151–58.
And Shaffer makes the insightful point that we are in “anarchy” with our
neighbors. If most people did not already have the character to
voluntarily respect most of their neighbors’ rights, society and
civilization would be impossible. Most people are good enough to permit
civilization to occur, despite the existence of some degree of public
and private crime. It is conceivable that the degree of goodness could
rise—due to education or more universal economic prosperity,
say—sufficient to make support for the legitimacy of states evaporate.
It’s just very unlikely.<a href="#fnref97" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn99"><p> As will become clear, by “self-ownership,” I am
referring to a person’s ownership <em>of his body</em>, where the person
(or actor or agent) is conceptually distinct from his body, just as
one’s mind is conceptually distinct from one’s brain, even if a mind is
not possible without a brain and a person cannot exist without a body.
Other terms such as “self-body-ownership” might be used instead, but
they are unwieldy. Some libertarians object to the concept of
self-ownership or body-ownership, maintaining that it implies some
mystical belief where the “person,” or perhaps his soul, is some spirit
that owns and “inhabits” or “occupies” the body. For an example of a
silly objection along these lines, Leland Yeager claims my advocacy of
self-ownership involves some kind of mind-body dichotomy mistake.

each person has the right to control his body; it is the opposite of
other-ownership, or domination and slavery. Nothing could be more

<li id="fn100"><p> As Professor Hoppe explains, a person’s body is “the
very prototype of a scarce good.” Hans-Hermann Hoppe, <em>The Economics
and Ethics of Private Property: Studies in Political Economy and
Philosophy</em> (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, 2006 [1993];
www.hanshoppe.com/eepp), p. 335; see also <em>idem</em>, <em>A Theory of
Socialism and Capitalism: Economics, Politics, and Ethics</em> (Auburn,
Ala.: Mises Institute, 2010 [1989]; www.hanshoppe.com/tsc), pp. 19 &amp;
21 <em>et pass.</em>, pp. 158–60. Once property rights are established
in one’s body (self-ownership), the argument can then be extended to
other, external, previously-unowned scarce resources. See generally
Hoppe, <em>The Economics and Ethics of Private Property</em>,
pp. 335–36, <em>et pass.</em> and <em>idem</em>, <em>A Theory of
Socialism and Capitalism</em>, pp. 19 &amp; 21 <em>et pass.</em>,
pp. 158–60 (re body rights) and p. 160 <em>et seq.</em> for property
rights in external resources. The self-ownership or body-ownership rule
can be formulated as “Nobody has the right to uninvitedly aggress
against the body of any other person and thus delimit or restrict
anyone’s control over his own body.” Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism
and Capitalism</em>, p. 159. But “conflicts over bodies, for whose
possible avoidance the nonaggression principle formulates a universally
justifiable solution, make up only a small portion of all possible
conflicts.” <em>Ibid.</em>, at 159–60. For conflicts related to the use
of other resources:</p>
<p>norms are needed, too, as it could come to conflicting evaluations
regarding their use. But in fact, any other norm must be logically
compatible with the nonaggression principle in order to be justified
itself, and, mutatis mutandis, every norm that could be shown to be
incompatible with this principle would have to be considered invalid. In
addition, as the things with respect to which norms have to be
formulated are scarce goods—just as a person’s body is a scarce good—and
as it is only necessary to formulate norms at all because goods are
<em>scarce</em> and not because they are <em>particular kinds</em> of
scarce goods, the specifications of the nonaggression principle,
conceived of as a special property norm referring to a specific kind of
good, must in fact already contain those of a <em>general</em> theory of
property.</p>
<p>Ibid., at 160. See also “A Libertarian Theory of Punishment and
Rights” (ch. 5), Part III.F, “Property Rights” (extending the body- or
self-ownership rights established by the preceding estoppel analysis to
external scarce resources).</p>

<li id="fn105"><p> Writes Hoppe: “While I can cite in favor of my
property claim regarding my body the objective fact that I was the
body’s first occupant—its first user—anyone else who claims to have the
right to control this body can cite nothing of the sort.” <em>A Theory
of Socialism and Capitalism</em>, p. 23. See also Kinsella,
“Intellectual Property and Libertarianism”:</p>
<p>the libertarian property-assignment rule for bodies is that each
person owns his own body. Implicit in the idea of self-ownership is the
belief that each person has a <em>better claim</em> to the body that he
or she directly controls and inhabits than do others. I have a better
claim to the right to control my body than you do, because it is
<em>my</em> body; I have a unique link and connection to my body that
others do not, and that is prior to the claim of any other person.</p>
<p>Anyone other than the original occupant of a body is a
<em>latecomer</em> with respect to the original occupant. Your claim to
my body is inferior in part because <em>I had it first</em>. The person
claiming your body can hardly object to the significance of what Hoppe
calls the “prior-later” distinction, since he adopts this very rule with
respect to his own body—he has to presuppose ownership of his own body
in order to claim ownership of yours.</p>
<p>As for this latter point, Auberon Herbert writes: “If the entities do
not belong to themselves, then we are reduced to the most absurd
conclusion. A or B cannot own himself; but he can own, or part own, C or
D.” Auberon Herbert, “Part XI,” in Auberon Herbert &amp; J. H. Levy,

“any indirect control of a good by a person presupposes the direct

has to admit the validity of the universalizability principle,”
<em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Nov. 10, 2011). Although Hoppe has not
directly addressed this issue, I believe this is compatible with his
argumentation ethics. Note that in the quote in note 17 below, he
states: “every attempt of an indirect control of my body by another
person must, unless I have <em>explicitly agreed to it</em>, be regarded
as unjust(ified)” (emphasis added). I believe the forfeiture of rights
that results from voluntarily committing aggression can be subsumed
under the “explicitly agreed to” provision; indeed, I have been
reluctant to separate out rectification as a third principle of property
rights allocation, in addition to original appropriation and contractual
transfer, since rectification can be thought of as a special case of
contractual transfer since aggression is a voluntary action that results
in changes of ownership, just as normal contracts do. However, due to
its special characteristics, it is worth calling it out as a third
principle, if its relationship to the first two principles (homesteading
and contract) is kept in mind. See, e.g., my formulation in Kinsella,

appropriate their bodies as they homestead or appropriate unowned
external resources. In the original article upon which this chapter is
based, I referred to the child at some point appropriating or
“homesteading” his body, but this was meant only as an analogy. Before
the child has rights, the body is owned by the mother as it is part of
her. After the child is recognized as having rights, but before he or
she has full capacity, the parents are the presumptive agents for and
guardians of the child. For more on the distinction between self- or

<li id="fn138"><p> We do not even have a direct or independent right to
free speech. The right to free speech is merely shorthand for one
positive result of the right to own private property: If I am situated
on property (resources) I have a right to be on, for example in my
home,<br />
I am entitled to do <em>anything</em> on or with that resource
(property) that does not invade others’ rights, whether it be skeet
shooting, barbecuing, or communicating with others. Thus, the right to
free speech is only indirect and does not in turn justify property
rights, which are logically at the base of the right to free speech. See
Rothbard, “‘Human Rights’ as Property Rights,” in <em>The Ethics of
Liberty</em> (https://mises.org/library/human-rights-property-rights),
pp. 113–17; Murray N. Rothbard, <em>For a New Liberty: The Libertarian
Manifesto</em>, rev. ed. (New York: Libertarian Review Foundation, 1985;
https://mises.org/library/new-liberty-<br />
libertarian-manifesto), pp. 42–44, discussing the relation between free
speech rights and property rights. In like manner, if there is a right
to punish, there is only indirectly a “right” to deter crime, and any
indirect right to deter, rehabilitate, or retaliate, which is based on
the right to punish, can hardly justify or limit the logically prior
right to punish.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, a property right is not a right to control a
resource but a right to exclude others from using the resource. But this
distinction is not material here. See “<em>Against Intellectual
Property</em> After Twenty Years: Looking Back and Looking Forward” (ch.
15), n.62 and Part IV.H, <em>et pass</em>. See also Stephan Kinsella,
“The Non-Aggression Principle as a Limit on Action, Not on Property
Rights,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 22, 2010) and <em>idem</em>,
“IP and Aggression as Limits on Property Rights: How They Differ,”
<em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 22, 2010); and “What Libertarianism
Is” (ch. 2), at n.2 and accompanying text.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of the term “property” to refer to a resource, see
“<em>Against Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years” (ch. 15), at
n. 31 and accompanying text, cautioning against use of “property” to
refer to the object of a property rights rather than the rights agents
have with respect to owned things. This and some other chapters
(originally authored years ago) sometimes use “property” in this
colloquial sense, but it should be kept in mind that in such cases, it
should be understood that the word “property” refers to the thing
(resource) owned. The civil law has a broad understanding of the concept
of a “thing,” which can be owned or the subject of legal rights; see
Louisiana Civil Code
(https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Laws_Toc.aspx?folder=67&amp;level=Parent),
art. 448: “Division of things. Things are divided into common, public,
and private; corporeals and incorporeals; and movables and immovables.”
Incidentally this exhaustive classification schema implies that
intellectual property rights are (private) “incorporeal movables.” See
also Kinsella, “Are Ideas Movable or Immovable?”, <em>C4SIF Blog</em>

<li id="fn139"><p> Others, of course, have recognized the distinction
between the effects or utility of punishment and the justification of
the <em>right</em> to punish. See, e.g., Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on
the Laws of England</em>, bk 4, pp. *7–*19, discussing in separate
subsections (1) the right or power to punish; (2) the object or end of
punishment, for example, rehabilitation, deterrence, or incapacitation;
and (3) the degree, measure, or quantity of punishment; Bradley,
<em>Ethical Studies</em>, pp. 26–27 (“Having once the right to punish,
we may modify the punishment according to the useful and the
pleasant.”); Hart, <em>Punishment and Responsibility</em>, p. 74 (“[W]e
must distinguish two questions commonly confused. They are, first ‘Why
do men in fact punish?’ This is a question of fact to which there may be
many different answers…. The second question, to be carefully
distinguished from the first, is ‘What justifies men in punishing? Why
is it morally good or morally permissible for them to punish?’”).<a

Punishment,” in Barnett &amp; Hagel III, eds., <em>Assessing the
Criminal</em>, p. 190. That said, we must be clear that the core of the
libertarian ethic and the notion of aggression and rights does not
center around the vague concept of “imposing cost,” contra the theory of
J.C. Lester, in his <em>Escape from Leviathan: Liberty, Welfare and
Anarchy Reconciled</em> (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2000), or
“causing harm,” as per T. Patrick Burke, <em>No Harm: Ethical Principles
for a Free Market</em> (New York: Paragon House, 1994). On Lester, see
Kinsella, “‘Aggression’ versus ‘Harm’ in Libertarianism,” <em>Mises
Economics Blog</em> (Dec. 16, 2009) (criticizing Lester’s approach, his
opposition to “justificationism,” and his focus on “imposed cost”
instead of aggression as the key libertarian principle); see also David
Gordon &amp; Roberta A. Modugno, “Review of J.C. Lester’s <em>Escape

No. 20 (Fall 1995; https://reasonpapers.com/archives/), p. 135–46;
<em>idem</em>, “‘Aggression’ versus ‘Harm’ in Libertarianism.” See also
Kinsella, “Hoppe on Property Rights in Physical Integrity vs Value,”
<em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (June 12, 2011). As Rothbard points
out:</p>
<p>Legal and political theory have committed much mischief by failing to
pinpoint physical invasion as the only human action that should be
illegal and that justifies the use of physical violence to combat it.
The vague concept of “harm” is substituted for the precise one of
physical violence. Consider the following two examples. Jim is courting
Susan and is just about to win her hand in marriage, when suddenly Bob
appears on the scene and wins her away. Surely Bob has done great “harm”
to Jim. Once a nonphysical-invasion sense of harm is adopted, almost any
outlaw act might be justified. Should Jim be able to “enjoin” Bob’s very
existence?</p>

“Hodlonaut,” that Wright is not Nakamoto and is instead a “fraud” and a

<p>“Wright has come out with a controversial claim, and must withstand
criticism from dissenters,” [Judge Engebrigtsen] added, concluding that
Granath’s statements were lawful, not defamatory.</p>
<p>Engebrigtsen also appeared to take up the idea that Twitter is a
naturally rough-and-tumble environment where users should have a thick
skin, after Granath’s lawyers noted that Wright had also tweeted strong
words such as “cuck” and “soy boy.”</p>

<li id="fn164"><p> More than once, I have had the frustrating and
bewildering experience of having someone actually assert that
consistency is not necessary for truth, that mutually contradictory
ideas can be held by a person and be true at the same time. When faced
with such a clearly incorrect opponent, one can do little more than try
to point out the absurdity of the opponent’s position. Beyond this,
though, a stubborn opponent must be viewed as having renounced reason
and logic and is thus simply unable or unwilling to engage in meaningful
discourse. See Peikoff, <em>Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn
Rand</em>, pp. 11–12, discussing when to abandon attempts to communicate
with stubbornly irrational individuals. The mere fact that individuals
can choose to disregard reason and logic does not contradict the
estoppel theory any more than a criminal who chooses to murder another
thereby “proves” that the victim had no right to life. As R.M. Hare
stated:</p>
<p>Just as one cannot win a game of chess against an opponent who will
not make any moves—and just as one cannot argue mathematically with a
person who will not commit himself to any mathematical statements—so
moral argument is impossible with a man who will make no moral
judgements at all…. Such a person is not entering the arena of moral
dispute, and therefore it is impossible to contest with him. <em>He is
compelled also—and this is important—to abjure the protection of
morality for his own interests.</em></p>

but they do not result in interesting or useful results. For example,
one could divide human conduct into jogging and not jogging, but to what
end? Although such a division would be valid, it would produce
uninteresting results, unlike the aggressive/nonaggressive division,
which produces relevant results for a theory of punishment, which
necessarily concerns the use of force. See Ludwig von Mises,

<li id="fn169"><p> On this subject, Alan Gewirth has noted:</p>
<p>Now these strict “oughts” involve normative necessity; they state
what, as of right, other persons <em>must</em> do. Such necessity is
also involved in the frequently noted use of “due” and “entitlement” as
synonyms or at least as components of the substantive use of “right.” A
person’s rights are what belong to him as his due, what he is entitled
to, hence what he can rightly demand of others.</p>

Rev.</em> 13 (1979): 1150. For discussion of Alan Gewirth’s
justification of rights and its relation to estoppel, see “Dialogical
Arguments for Libertarian Rights” (ch. 5), the section “Pilon and
Gewirth on the Principle of Generic Consistency,” esp. n.39 and
accompanying text; also Kinsella, “Estoppel: A New Justification for
Individual Rights,” p. 71 n.9; see also Hare, <em>Freedom and

<li id="fn170"><p> If a skeptic were to object to the use of moral
concepts here—for example, wrong, should, etc.—it should be noted that
it is the criminal, <em>A</em>, who introduces normative, rights-related
terminology when <em>A</em> tries to object to <em>A</em>’s punishment.
Randy Barnett makes a similar point in a different context. Professor
Barnett argues that those who claim that the U.S. Constitution justifies
certain government regulation of individuals are themselves making a
normative claim, which may thus be examined or criticized from a moral
point of view by others. See Randy E. Barnett, “Getting Normative: The
Role of Natural Rights in Constitutional Adjudication,”

www.randybarnett.com/pre-2000): 93–122, at 100–01; see also

Constitutional Law,” <em>Connecticut L. Rev.</em> 25 (1993;

unavoidable connection between natural law and positive law in
constitutional adjudication.<a href="#fnref170" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn171"><p> If <em>A</em> cannot even claim that aggression—the
<em>initiation</em> of force—is wrong, then, <em>a fortiori</em>,
<em>A</em> cannot make the subsidiary claim that retaliatory or
responsive force is wrong.<a href="#fnref171" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn172"><p> Although <em>A</em> may not complain that his
imminent execution by <em>C</em> would violate his rights, this does not
necessarily mean that <em>C</em> may legitimately execute him. It only
means that <em>A</em>’s complaint may not be heard and that <em>A</em>’s
rights are not violated by being executed. A third party <em>T</em>,
however, may have another legitimate complaint about A’s execution, one
which does not assert <em>A</em>’s rights but rather takes other
factors, such as the special nature of the defense agency <em>C</em>,
into account—especially if the defense agency is a government (a state).
For example, <em>T</em> may argue that the state, as an inherently
dangerous and powerful entity, should not be allowed to kill even
murderers because giving such power to the state is so inherently
dangerous and threatening to innocent, non-estopped people, like
<em>T</em>, that it amounts to an aggression and a violation of
<em>T</em>’s rights. Further, if the state deems itself to be
<em>B</em>’s agent, <em>B</em>’s heir may conceivably object to the
state’s execution of <em>A</em>, claiming the sole right to execute or
otherwise punish <em>A</em>. For lesser crimes, such as assault, where
the victim <em>B</em> remains alive, <em>B</em> himself may object to
the state’s administering punishment to the aggressor.</p>
<p>Similarly, after applying estoppel solely to the relationship between
the defense agency, <em>C</em>, and a defendant, <em>A</em>, the
exclusionary rule—whereby a court may not use evidence if it is
illegally obtained—would fall. If <em>A</em> actually committed the
crime, it cannot violate his rights for the court to discover this fact,
even if the evidence was illegally obtained; <em>A</em> would still be
estopped from complaining about his punishment. However, a third party
can conceivably argue that it is too dangerous for a defense agency,
<em>C</em>, to have a system which gives it incentives to illegally
search people and that the exclusionary rule is therefore a necessary
procedural or prophylactic rule required in order to protect
<em>innocent</em> people from <em>C</em>’s dangerousness—this is
especially true if <em>C</em> is a <em>governmental</em> defense agency.
In essence, the argument would be that prosecutions by the state or
other defense agencies, without an exclusionary rule to temper the
danger of such prosecutions, could amount to aggression or a standing
threat against innocent third parties. For a related discussion, see
Part III.D.3, and note 50, below. See also Patrick Tinsley, Stephan
Kinsella &amp; Walter Block, “In Defense of Evidence and Against the
Exclusionary Rule: A Libertarian Approach,” <em>Southern U. L.
Rev.</em>, 32 no. 1 (2004; www.walterblock.com/publications),
pp. 63-80.</p>
<p>Whether such arguments of third parties could be fully developed is a
separate question beyond the scope of this chapter. I merely wish to
point out that other complaints about certain government actions are not
automatically barred just because the specific criminal cannot complain.
Just because <em>C</em>’s imprisonment of <em>A</em> does not aggress
against <em>A</em> does not necessarily show that such action does not
aggress against others.<a href="#fnref172" class="footnote-back"

Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologica</em> (New Advent,

Question 64, art. 7:</p>
<p>Nothing hinders one act from having two effects, only one of which is
intended, while the other is beside the intention. Now moral acts take
their species according to what is intended, and not according to what
is beside the intention, since this is accidental…. Accordingly the act
of self-defense may have two effects, one is the saving of one’s life,
the other is the slaying of the aggressor. Therefore this act, since
one’s intention is to save one’s own life, is not unlawful, seeing that
it is natural to everything to keep itself in “being,” as far as
possible. And yet, though proceeding from a good intention, an act may
be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion to the end. Wherefore
if a man, in self-defense, uses more than necessary violence, it will be
unlawful: whereas if he repel force with moderation his defense will be
lawful, because … “it is lawful to repel force by force, provided one
does not exceed the limits of a blameless defense.” Nor is it necessary
for salvation that a man omit the act of moderate self-defense in order
to avoid killing the other man, since one is bound to take more care of
one’s own life than of another’s.<a href="#fnref173"

<li id="fn180"><p> This is not to say that the passage of time cannot be
relevant for other reasons. Just as capital punishment does not violate
the rights of the executed murderer, it can conceivably be objected to
on the grounds of the danger posed by such a practice to innocent
people. See note 42, above. So punishment after a long period of time
does not violate the rights of actually guilty criminals but may
arguably constitute a threat to innocent people—because of the relative
unreliability of stale evidence, faded memories, etc. But these are
procedural or structural, not substantive, concerns, the discussion of
which is beyond the scope of this chapter. My focus here is the basic
principles of rights that must underlie any general justification of
punishment, even if other procedural or systemic features also need to
be taken into account after a prima facie right to punish is
established. Thus, this chapter also does not consider such questions as
the danger of being a judge in one’s own case, as these are separate
concerns. For discussion of the risks of individuals acting as judge,
jury, and executioner, see Robert Nozick, <em>Anarchy, State, and
Utopia</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1974), pp. 54–146. On the danger of
being a judge in one’s own case, see “<em>The Theodosian Code,” in The
Theodosian Code and Novels and the Sirmondian Constitutions</em>, Clyde
Pharr, trans. (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University, 1952), § 2.2.1;

<li id="fn182"><p> Whether someone can genuinely believe something is
impermissible and yet do it anyway is questionable. As Hare has pointed
out, “If a man does what he says he ought not to, … then there is
something wrong with what he says, as well as with what he does.” Hare,

<li id="fn183"><p> Any other similar argument of <em>A</em>’s would also
fail. For example, <em>A</em> could defend himself by asserting that
there is no such thing as free will, so that he was determined to murder
<em>B</em>, and thus cannot be blamed for doing so. However, note that
the estoppel theory nowhere assumed the existence of free will, so such
an argument is irrelevant. Moreover, if <em>A</em> is correct that there
is no free will, then <em>C</em> is similarly predestined to do whatever
he will, and if this includes punishing <em>A</em>, how can <em>C</em>
be blamed? The logic of reciprocity is inescapable. R.P. Phillips has
called such a type of axiom a “boomerang principle … for even though we
cast it away from us, it returns to us again.” R.P. Phillips, <em>Modern

<li id="fn187"><p> Lawrence Crocker discusses a similar use of “moral
estoppel” in preventing a criminal from asserting the unfairness of
being punished in certain situations. Crocker, “The Upper Limit of Just
Punishment,” p. 1067. Crocker’s theory, while interesting, is not
developed along the same lines as the estoppel theory developed herein,
nor does Crocker seem to realize the implications of estoppel for
justifying only the libertarian conception of rights. Rather than
focusing on the reciprocity between the force used in punishment and the
force of an aggressive act by a wrongdoer, Crocker claims that a person
who has “treated another person or the society at large in a fashion
that the criminal law prohibits” is “morally estopped” from asserting
that his punishment would be unfair. Ibid. However, Crocker’s use of
estoppel is too vague and imprecise, for just because one has violated a
criminal law does not mean that one has committed the aggression which
is necessary to estop him from complaining about punishment. The law
must first be valid for Crocker’s assumption to hold, but as the
estoppel theory indicates, a law is valid only if it prohibits
aggression. Thus, it is not the mere violating of a law that estops a
lawbreaker from complaining about being punished—the law might be
illegitimate—it is the initiation of force. Crocker is also discussed in
“Dialogical Arguments for Libertarian Rights” (ch. 6).<a

is the defining characteristic of property. Taking another’s good has
the effect of depriving the owner of it because it is scarce; if goods
were infinitely abundant then it would not be possible to “take” them
because the taking would have no consequence at all, and thus, the
concepts of property and scarcity would not arise. <em>See</em> Hoppe,

only option is to attempt to measure or balance a difficult-to-balance
equation—for example, by trying to equate somewhat quantifiable physical
aspects of force, such as the magnitude and type of force and the
physical consequences thereof—she cannot be blamed and the aggressor may
not complain. For an illustrative theory proposing to attribute fault
and liability according to objective factors such as force and momentum
in a situation such as an automobile collision, see the sections on
causation and causal defenses, respectively, in Richard A. Epstein,

maintain that force against <em>A</em> and force against <em>B</em> were
wholly incommensurable, he could never meaningfully object to being
punished—for to object to punishment, <em>A</em> must maintain that such
force is unjust and that some level and type of force could be justly
used to prevent his punishment. But this implies at least some
commensurability. If <em>A</em> really maintains incommensurability,
<em>B</em> may take him at his word and posit that <em>B</em>’s
punishment of <em>A</em> justifies <em>no</em> retaliatory force on

<li id="fn206"><p> However, where the thief is poorer than the victim,
as is usually the case, this does not mean that the victim is not
entitled to recoup the entire $10,000. For example, if the $10,000
stolen is only 1% of the victim’s estate and the thief’s estate is only
$10,000 total—after the victim has retaken his own $10,000 from the
thief—it is not the case that the victim is limited to 1% of
$10,000—$100. Because it is the thief who caused the harm, the victim
should have the option of selecting the higher of (a) the amount that
was stolen, or (b) a higher amount that is equivalent in terms of damage
done. For further suggestions along these lines, such as Stephen
Schafer’s view that punishment “’should … be equally burdensome and just
for all criminals, irrespective of their means, whether they be
millionaires or labourers,”’ see Randy E. Barnett, “Restitution: A New
Paradigm of Criminal Justice,” in Barnett &amp; Hagel III, eds.,
<em>Assessing the Criminal</em>, pp. 349, 363–64, quoting Stephen
Schafer, <em>Compensation and Restitution to Victims of Crime</em>, 2d
ed. (Montclair, N.J.: Patterson Smith, 1970), p. 127. It should be noted
that Rothbard’s view of restitution and retribution is slightly
different from the principles discussed above. <em>See</em> Rothbard,
“Punishment and Proportionality,” at 86.</p>
<p>Further, suppose that A, the victim, was about to use the $10,000 to
save his own or another’s life: for example, as a ransom for his
daughter’s kidnapper or to pay for a medical procedure to save his
daughter’s life. Theft of the $10,000 from a sufficiently poor person,
or at a crucial time, could very well lead to death—the kidnapper
murders the daughter because he was not paid. In this case it is very
possible that execution of the thief could be justified since the
consequences of this theft were even more severe than normal, especially
in the case where the thief was aware of the potentially
life-endangering consequences of the theft. For the principle that a
criminal or tortfeasor “takes his victim as he finds him,” see note 83,

Criminal Code defines assault as “an attempt to commit a battery, or the
intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of receiving a
battery.” <em>Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated</em>, § 14:36
(https://legis.la.gov/legis/Laws_Toc.aspx?folder=75&amp;level=Parent). A
battery is defined as “the intentional use of force or violence upon the
person of another; or the intentional administration of a poison or
other noxious liquid or substance to another.” Ibid., § 14:33. Assault
can thus also include an attempted battery, which need not put the
victim in a state of apprehension of receiving a battery—for example,
the victim may be asleep and be unaware that another has just swung a
club at his head, but missed. This second definition of assault is
ignored for our present purposes.</p>

<p>See also Rothbard’s argument for why threats (and fraud) count as

<p>Defensive violence, therefore, must be confined to resisting invasive
acts against person or property. But such invasion may include two
corollaries to actual physical aggression: <em>intimidation</em>, or a
direct threat of physical violence; and <em>fraud</em>, which involves
the appropriation of someone else’s property without his consent, and is
therefore “implicit theft.”</p>

<li id="fn211"><p> Many crimes would have established or generally
accepted levels or at least ranges of permissible punishment—for
example, as worked out by a private justice system of a free society or
by specialists writing treatises on the subject. For further discussion
of the role of judges or other decentralized law-finding fora, and of
legislatures, in the development of law, see “Legislation and the
Discovery of Law in a Free Society” (ch. 13). No doubt litigants in
court or equivalent forums, especially the defendant, would hire lawyers
to present the best arguments possible in favor of punishment and its
permissible bounds. In a society that respects the general libertarian
theory of rights and punishment developed herein, one could even expect
lawyers to specialize in arguing whether a defendant is estopped from
asserting a particular defense, whether a given defense is capable of
being made universal or particular when the burden of proof for each
side has been satisfied, and the like.</p>
<p>With regard to the concept of making a prima facie case and switching
the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant, Richard Epstein
has set forth a promising theory of pleadings and presumptions whereby
one party who wishes to upset the initial balance must establish a prima
facie case that may be countered by a defense, which may be met with a
second round of prima facie arguments, and so on. See Richard A.
Epstein, “Pleading and Presumptions,” <em>U. Chicago L. Rev.</em> 40
(1973), p. 556. For its application to the fields of torts and
intentional harms, see <em>idem</em>, <em>A Theory of Strict
Liability</em>; <em>idem</em>, “Defenses and Subsequent Pleas in a

<li id="fn212"><p> Admittedly, it is difficult to know how this argument
would proceed or even what would qualify as a good argument. But such
concerns are the aggressor’s worry, not the victim’s. And there is an
easy way to avoid being placed in this position: do not initiate force
against your fellow man.<a href="#fnref212" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn213"><p> This is an ancient principle of justice. For
example:</p>
<p>It is well settled in our jurisprudence that a defendant <em>takes
his victim as he finds him</em> and is responsible for all natural and
probable consequences of his tortious conduct. Where defendant’s
negligent action aggravates a preexisting injury or condition, he must
compensate the victim for the full extent of his aggravation.</p>

Hart] introduces to show that the constraints on the nature of law

invokes Hart’s notion in support of what, at first blush, might seem to
be the opposite conclusion, i.e., that fundamental problems of human
nature impose very strong constraints on the content of the law. This
seeming opposition is dissolved once we appreciate that Hart introduced
his idea to show that nature imposes very weak constraints on the
concept of law, that is, on what can count as a “law,” from the point of
view of philosophical analysis…. Barnett uses Hart’s terminology for the
very different purpose of showing that nature imposes very strong
constraints on what laws can be justified…. Barnett would not claim that
his argument establishes that compliance with his liberal conception of
justice is required for a norm to count as a law.</p>

<em>Liberty</em> 2, no. 2 (Nov. 1988; https://perma.cc/A5UU-P64A):
44–45, at 44. The late Leland Yeager claimed that Rothbard, who died in
January 1995, had changed his mind before his death regarding the
validity of Hoppe’s argument, even after endorsing it in 1988. Leland B.
Yeager, “Book Review,” <em>Rev. Austrian Econ.</em> 9, no. 1 (1996;
https://perma.cc/UDC3-UQ3Z): 181–88 (reviewing Murray N. Rothbard,
<em>Economic Thought Before Adam Smith</em> and <em>Classical
Economics</em>, vols. 1 and 2 of <em>An Austrian Perspective on the
History of Economic Thought</em> (Aldershot, England and Brookfield,
Vt.: Edward Elgar, 1995; https://perma.cc/3ABN-9FD2)). Yeager asserts
that, based on language in this posthumously-published treatise:</p>
<p>Rothbard no longer endorses Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s claim to derive
libertarian policy positions purely from the circumstances of discussion
itself, without any appeal to value judgments…. On the contrary, and as
he had done earlier, Rothbard now correctly observes that policy
recommendations and decisions presuppose value judgments as well as
positive analysis. (p. 185)</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Yeager himself sees no merit in Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics. See Leland B. Yeager, “Raw Assertions,”
<em>Liberty 2</em>, no. 2 (Nov. 1988; https://perma.cc/A5UU-P64A):
45–46. However, Yeager provides no evidence for his contention about
Rothbard’s change of mind. It is undoubtedly wrong.</p>
<p>Hoppe’s argumentation ethics has drawn a number of critics and
defenders since its debut in the mid-1980s, and continues to attract

discourse with his accuser at all. But if the criminal is to put forward
an objection to his punishment, he must engage in argumentation and thus
be subject to the rules of argumentation. As Hare noted in a similar
context:</p>
<p>Just as one cannot win a game of chess against an opponent who will
not make any moves—and just as one cannot argue mathematically with a
person who will not commit himself to any mathematical statements—so
moral argument is impossible with a man who will make no moral judgments
at all…. Such a person is not entering the arena of moral dispute, and
therefore it is impossible to contest with him. <em>He is compelled
also—and this is important—to abjure the protection of morality for his
own interests</em>.</p>

<p>[J]ust as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not
wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a
number of other nations—as though you and your superiors had any right
to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world—we find
that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to
want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only
reason, you must hang.</p>

<li id="fn247"><p> As Hoppe’s argumentation ethics approach grounds
self-ownership rights and then is extended to cover property rights, so
the estoppel argument may also be extended to cover property rights and
the Lockean homesteading principle, essentially by showing that
self-ownership rights presuppose the right to homestead, because one is
meaningless without the other. See “A Libertarian Theory of Punishment
and Rights” (ch. 5), Part III.F. As the U.S. Supreme Court has
recognized, “The right to enjoy property without lawful deprivation … is
in truth a ‘personal’ right…. In fact, a fundamental
<em>interdependence</em> exists between the personal right to liberty
and the personal right in property. <em>Neither could have meaning
without the other</em>. That rights in property are basic civil rights
has long been recognized.” <em>Lynch v. Household Fin. Corp.</em>, 405
U.S. 538, 552 (1972) (emphasis added). But see the famous (infamous, to
some of us) footnote 4 in <em>United States v. Carolene Products
Co.</em>, 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938) (implying that economic and
property rights are less fundamental than personal rights).<a

<li id="fn248"><p> Many definitions of the concept “rights” have been
offered. See, e.g., Antony Flew, <em>A Dictionary of Philosophy</em>,
rev’d 2d ed. (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1984), p. 306 (defining
“rights”); idem, “What is a ‘Right’?”, <em>Georgia L. Rev.</em> 13
(1979): 1117–41; Alan Gewirth, “The Basis and Content of Human Rights,”
<em>Georgia L. Rev.</em> 13 (1979): 1143–70, at 1148; Wesley N. Hohfeld,
<em>Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning</em>,
W.W. Cook, ed. (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1946), p. 30
<em>et passim</em> (discussing four senses of “rights” and explaining
that a right is a three-term relation between a right-holder, a type of
action, and one or more other persons); Albert Kocourek, <em>Jural
Relations</em> (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1927), p. 7; Lomasky,
<em>Persons, Rights, and the Moral Community,</em> p. 101; Machan,
<em>Individuals and Their Rights</em>, pp. 1–2; Narveson, <em>The
Libertarian Idea</em>, chap. 5; Nozick, Anarchy, State, and Utopia,
pp. 29–30; Ayn Rand, “Man’s Rights,” in Rand, <em>The</em> <em>Virtue of
Selfishness</em>, pp. 29–30; Rasmussen and Den Uyl, <em>Liberty and
Nature</em>, p. 111. One of the clearest, non-tautological definitions
of rights of which I am aware is Sadowsky’s:</p>
<p>When we say that one has the right to do certain things we mean this
and only this, that it would be immoral for another, alone or in
combination, to stop him from doing this by the use of physical force or
the threat thereof. We do not mean that any use a man makes of his
property within the limits set forth is necessarily a <em>moral</em>
use.</p>
<p>James A. Sadowsky, “Private Property and Collective Ownership,” in
<em>The Libertarian Alternative</em>, Tibor R. Machan, ed. (Chicago:
Nelson-Hall Co., 1974), pp. 120–21. Whatever the definition, however, it
seems clear that the concept of rights and the concept of enforceability
are mutually dependent in the sense discussed in the text.</p>
<p>Note: I now am of the view that rights are best viewed as metanorms
that direct us as to which laws are just, not directly to personal
behavior. Most libertarians would view rights as a subset of morality;
not everything that is immoral should be illegal, but every rights
violation is necessarily immoral. I believe the sets are intersecting
sets only. Just as some immoral actions are not rights violations, some
rights violations might be morally mandatory (breaking into a cabin to
feed your baby in the middle of a storm). I do believe <em>most</em>
rights violations are immoral, though libertarianism itself cannot make
this determination. For more on rights as metanorms, see Douglas B.
Rasmussen &amp; Douglas J. Den Uyl, “Why Individual Rights? Rights as
Metanormative Principles,” in <em>Norms of Liberty: A Perfectionist
Basis for Non-Perfectionist Politics</em> (Pennsylvania State University
Press, 2005):</p>
<p>An individual’s right to liberty is thus not in essence a normative
principle. Rather, it is a metanormative principle. In other words, it
is concerned with the creation, interpretation, and justification of a
political/legal context in which the possibility of the pursuit of
flourishing is secured.<a href="#fnref248" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn249"><p> Indeed, another way to respond to a rights-skeptic
would be to propose to physically harm him. If there are no rights, as
he maintains, then he cannot object to being harmed. So, presumably, any
rights-skeptic would change his position and admit there were rights (if
only so as to be able to object to being harmed)—or there would soon be
no more rights-skeptics left alive to give rights-advocates any guff.

<em>New Libertarian</em> (April 1985;
https://mises.org/library/duty-natural-outlaws-shut):</p>
<p>The nihilists remind me of the classic bore at college bull sessions:
“Nyah, nyah, prove to me that this chair exists!” Trying desperately for
“proof” accomplishes nothing, of course, to wipe the mocking smile off
the face of the Outlaw. In a deep sense, and on many levels, the proper
riposte is to hit the Outlaw over the head with the chair. For one
thing, the purpose of philosophic discourse is, or should be, to arrive
mutually at the truth, not to engage in parlor games or verbal fencing.
To engage in such games, to be a bravura pest for pest’s sake, is to put
oneself outside the realm of rational discourse. (But this, of course,
is a moral as well as factual statement!)</p>
<p>See also Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “In Defense of Extreme Rationalism,” in
<em>The Great Fiction: Property, Economy, Society, and the Politics of
Decline</em> (Second Expanded Edition, Mises Institute, 2021;
www.hanshoppe.com/tgf), p. 310:</p>
<p>Why should we follow [McCloskey’s] advice of paying attention to talk
and not resorting to violence, particularly in view of the fact that
what is advocated here is talk of the sort where anything goes and where
everything said is just as good a candidate for one’s attention as
anything else? It certainly is not evident that one should pay much
attention to talk if that is what talk is all about! Moreover, it would
be downright fatal to follow this ethic. For any viable human ethic must
evidently allow people to do things other than talk, if only to have a
single human survivor who could possibly have any ethical questions;
McCloskey’s talk-ethic, however, gives us precisely such deadly advice
of never to <em>stop</em> talking or stop listening to others talk. In
addition, McCloskey himself and his fellow hermeneuticians must admit
that they can have no objective ground for proposing their ethic anyway.
For if there are no objective standards of truth, then it must also be
the case that one’s ethical proposals cannot claim to be objectively
justifiable either. But what is wrong, then, with not being persuaded by
all of this and, rather than listening further, hitting McCloskey on the
head straightaway rather than waiting until he perishes from following
his own prescription of endless talk? Clearly, if McCloskey were right,
nothing could be said to be objectively wrong with this.</p>
<p>The arguments directed here against rights-skeptics also apply,
<em>mutatis mutandis</em>, to radical pacifists—that is, to those who
claim not just that pacifism is preferred morally or tactically, but
that victims of aggression are not entitled to use force in self-defense
or that victims somehow violate the rights of their aggressors.<a

“law,” “law” has a procedural component that, if adhered to, limits a
government’s arbitrary and irrational use of power. Blackman contends
that language users implicitly accept this normative, procedural aspect
of what is described as law; they use a definition of law that also
limits what state power can be classified as law. Of course, H.L.A. Hart
argues that some types of rules or arbitrary commands enforced by a
given regime are too unlawlike to be considered even positive law. See
Hart, <em>The Concept of Law</em>, chap. II, §2; chap. IX, §3. A

position. See also <em>idem</em>, “The Intersection of Natural Rights

p. 268. Concerning extending Hoppe’s discourse ethics to natural law, it
should be pointed out that both Hoppe and Madison appear skeptical of
the validity of classic natural law theory. Madison states that rights
are not “a requirement of some natural law existing independently of the
reasoning process and discernible only by metaphysical insight into the
‘nature of things’” (p. 269); Hoppe states, as noted in text at note 11,
above: “It has been a common quarrel with the natural rights position,
even on the part of sympathetic readers, that the concept of human
nature is far ‘too diffuse and varied to provide a determinate set of
contents of natural law’”; see also notes 10–14, above, and accompanying
text; and “The Undeniable Morality of Capitalism” (ch. 22). However,
Machan, accepting the validity of action-based ethical theories (similar
to Pilon’s and Gewirth’s approach, discussed below), but not
purely-argumentation-based theories, also maintains that “human action

claiming that</p>

the presuppositions of human action that require certain political

<p>[I]t must be presupposed of <em>any</em> intellectual position, that
it is meaningful and can be argued with regard to its cognitive value,
simply because it is presented in a language and communicated. To argue
otherwise would already implicitly admit its validity. One is forced,
then, to accept a rationalist approach towards ethics for the very same
reason that one was forced to adopt a rationalist instead of an
empiricist epistemology….</p>
<p>The above argument shows us that any truth claim—the claim connected
with any proposition that it is true, objective, or valid (all terms
used synonymously here)—is and must be raised and decided upon in the
course of an argumentation. And since it cannot be disputed that this is
so (one cannot communicate and argue that one cannot communicate and
argue), and it must be assumed that everyone knows what it means to
claim something to be true (one cannot deny this statement without
claiming its negation to be true), this has been aptly called “the a
priori of communication and argumentation.”<a href="#fnref285"

<li id="fn290"><p> Murphy <em>appears</em> to concede this point that
universalizability is an undeniable requirement for normative
justification; he simply thinks it isn’t useful. In the informal
discussion on <em>Anti-state.com</em> following my original response
article, there was this exchange:</p>
<p>Kinsella: “No one, that I can see, has been <em>denying</em> that
fundamental moral principles should be universalizable.”</p>
<p>Murphy: “<em>Right</em>. All I (and I think Gene) have argued is that
‘universalizability’ doesn’t really help much in deciding between
concrete systems. At a formal level, socialism doesn’t imply ‘I have the
right to hit you but you don’t have the right to hit me’ anymore than
capitalism does. Socialism really says, ‘I have the right to hit you if
the elected government [or whatever] says it’s legitimate,’ and
capitalism really says, ‘I have the right to hit you in defense of my
property rights.’ So the issue boils down to whether socialism and
capitalism can be justified on other grounds. I.e., the universalization
principle doesn’t give us any help in picking between the two.</p>
<p>Archived at https://tinyurl.com/54rzjcnp and
https://perma.cc/UU8S-2APB (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Callahan, by contrast, does not appear to even grant the
universalizability requirement. From our exchange at the same page:</p>
<p>lee_mccracken: “does this ‘universalizability’ principle imply that
there can’t be special moral duties (say, the duties of parents to
children or vice versa)? Hoppe says that such principles could be found
to be universally acceptable if they are ‘grounded in the nature of
things’, but I’m not quite sure what this means. Can anyone explain that
further?”</p>
<p>Callahan: “My cynical view: ‘the nature of things’ means whatever you
want it to in order to get to the conclusion you want anyway.”</p>
<p>Kinsella: “Right. As [] I suspected, you do not seem to accept the
validity of the universalizability principle. Which, as I indicated,
leads to skepticism, which of course goes hand in hand with cynicism….
Gene, I’d ask you to confirm or deny that you reject the
universalizability principle—but I won’t hold out hope that you will do
this. But if you would confirm it, I’d say—you are subject to this
criticism (about the nature of things) yourself. And if you deny it, I’d
ask you—do you really realize the implications of such a denial?”</p>
<p>Callahan did not to respond to this direct question.</p>
<p>Murphy is correct that some socialist norms can be universalized, as
Hoppe himself explicitly notes (see text at note 19). However, as Hoppe
points out, this does not mean that all invalid norms can be
reformulated to avoid violating universalizability, and can serve as a
first-level “filter” for eliminating some particularizable norms; nor
that the universalizability criterion is useless for, if one is forced
to reformulate an apparently particularized (and thus facially invalid)
norm to avoid this problem, it exposes the nature of the claimed norm
more clearly so that it can be compared to other, more substantive,
norms necessarily presupposed by any participants in argumentative
justification. See text at note 20 below, <em>et pass</em>. See also

Also, to the extent that utilitarian proponents are still around, they
demonstrate through their actions that their consequentialist doctrine
is and must be regarded as false. Acting and proposition-making require
private property rights now and cannot wait for them to be assigned only
later.”); Hoppe, “Appendix: Four Critical Replies,” in <em>The Economics

and Economics of Private Property,” in <em>The Great Fiction</em>, at
section III, “Misconceptions and Clarifications.” See also Rothbard,
“Beyond Is and Ought” (emphasis added):</p>
<p>In the modern libertarian movement, only the natural-rights
libertarians have come to satisfyingly absolute libertarian conclusions.
The different wings of “consequentialists”—whether emotivists,
utilitarians, Stirnerites, or whatever—have tended to buckle at the
seams. If, after all, one has to <em>wait for consequences to make a
firm decision</em>, one can hardly adopt a consistent, hard-nosed stance
for liberty and private property in every conceivable case.</p>
<p>See also Hoppe, “The Justice of Economic Efficiency,” in <em>The
Economics and Ethics of Private Property</em>, at 337:</p>
<p>While every person can have control over whether or not his actions
cause the physical integrity of something to change, control over
whether or not one’s actions affect the value of someone’s property to
change rests with other people and their evaluations. One would have to
interrogate and come to an agreement with the entire world population to
make sure that one’s planned actions would not change another person’s
evaluations regarding his property. Everyone would be long dead before
this could ever be accomplished.</p>

conditions under which their argumentation takes place. In this case, if
the slave master would say to the slave “let’s not fight but
<em>argue</em> about the justification of slavery,” and he would thereby
recognize the slave as another, separate and independent person with his
own mind and body, he would have to let the slave go free and leave. And
if he would say instead “so what, I have recognized you momentarily as
another independent person with your own mind and body, but now, at the
end of our dispute, I deny you ownership of the means necessary to argue
with me and prevent you from leaving anyway,” <em>then</em> he would be
involved in a performative or dialectic contradiction.</p>
<p>See also Slenzok, “The Libertarian Argumentation Ethics, the
Transcendental Pragmatics of Language, and the Conflict-Freedom
Principle,” p. 57 <em>et pass.</em></p>
<p>Of course, as I noted in the text above, if the slave had committed
aggression against the master-owner, then the owner would not be
involved in contradiction by treating the slave differently than
himself. See also, on this issue, Van Dun, “Argumentation Ethics and the
Philosophy of Freedom,” pp. 26–27; also p. 24 (emphasis added):</p>
<p>[Hoppe’s] argument is that when A and B enter into an argumentation
both of them do so under the dialectically valid presumptions of
rationality, innocence, and self-ownership—presumptions that will hold
<em>until there is proof that they should be withdrawn.</em></p>
<p>And ibid., p. 16 n.34 (emphasis added):</p>
<p>[MC] assert “We cannot convince you of anything by clubbing you, but
we may quite logically try to convince you that we should have the right
to club you” (M&amp;C, p.58). True, <em>they may try to convince me that
they ought to have the right to punish me for my crimes, if I have
committed any</em>. There is a good chance that they will succeed. But
how on earth do they hope to convince me by means of logical arguments
that they should have the right to club me, <em>regardless of what I may
have done or will do</em>? If the (unqualified) statement “We have a
right to club you” were justifiable then clubbing a person would be a
justifiable action also in an argumentation.</p>
<p>See also ibid., p. 26 n.62:</p>
<p>Obviously, as noted before, there may be cases where the use of force
to deprive another of his freedom is justified, for example to make him
pay for his crimes, or to stop him from completing the crime he is in
the process of committing. One may be justified in using uninvited force
against such persons. However, these are not paradigmatic cases of the
sort of slavery to which Friedman or Murphy and Callahan refer.<a

<p>Another “objection” to my argument from argumentation, advanced
repeatedly and by several opponents in a seemingly most serious manner,
actually better qualifies as a joke. It boils down to the claim that,
even if true, my argument is irrelevant and inconsequential. Why?
Because the ethics of argumentation is valid and binding only at the
moment and for the duration of argumentation itself and even then only
for those actually participating in it. Curiously, these critics do not
notice that this thesis, if it were true, would have to apply to itself,
too, and hence, render their own criticism irrelevant and
inconsequential also. Their criticism itself then would be just talk for
the sake of talking, without any consequence outside of talking. For,
according to their own thesis, what they say about argumentation is true
only when and while they are saying it and has no relevance outside the
context of argumentation; and moreover, that what they say to be true is
true only for the parties actually involved in argumentation or even
only for <em>them alone</em>, if and insofar as there is no
<em>actual</em> opponent and they say what they say in an internal
dialog only to themselves. But why, then, should anyone waste his time
and pay attention to such private “truths”?</p>

<li id="fn321"><p> As described elsewhere in this book, aggression means
nonconsensual use of another’s owned resources, so is dependent upon the
prior and more fundamental concept of property rights. In other words,
to determine what actions constitution aggression, one must first know
who owns what. See “What Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2), at notes 6, 9, 11,

About Property (2019)”; <em>idem</em>, “Aggression and Property Rights
Plank in the Libertarian Party Platform,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em>

order to identify and analyze property rights violations, an analysis of
<em>action</em> is necessary. See <em>idem</em>, “The Non-Aggression
Principle as a Limit on Action, Not on Property Rights,”
<em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 22, 2010) and <em>idem</em>, “IP and

<li id="fn322"><p> As Hoppe writes:</p>
<p>Essentially, economic analysis consists of: (1) an understanding of
the categories of action and an understanding of the meaning of a
<em>change</em> in values, costs, technological knowledge, etc.; (2) a
description of a situation in which these categories assume concrete
meaning, where definite people are identified as actors with definite
objects specified as their means of action, with definite goals
identified as values and definite things specified as costs; and (3) a
deduction of the consequences that result from the performance of some
specified action in this situation, or of the consequences that result
for an actor if this situation is changed in a specified way. And this
deduction must yield a priori-valid conclusions, provided there is no
flaw in the very process of deduction and the situation and the change
introduced into it being given, and a priori-valid conclusions about
reality if the situation and situation-change, as described, can
themselves be identified as real, because then their validity would
ultimately go back to the indisputable validity of the categories of
action.</p>

<li id="fn331"><p> In my view, one need not take a stand on the
interminable (and somewhat pointless and intractable) free will debate
to hold these views. It does not matter if humans “really” have
“genuine” free will in the causal realm in order to usefully
characterize their actions teleologically. We conscious and self-aware
humans are aware of the external world via our senses and reason, but
also aware of an internal perspective by which we characterize our own
actions as involving choice and goals. In order to understand, interact
with, and predict the behavior or conduct of other humans, it is
reasonable and useful for us to assume they have a similar internal
perspective, since they are biologically similar to us, and thus, to
interpret their motions as actions in pursuit of goals, as opposed to
mere causal behavior. To the extent we adopt a teleological perspective
to characterize other humans’ actions, categories of choice, opportunity
cost, time preference, and so on are unavoidable. Though I do not
consider it relevant to the arguments made in this chapter (or this
book), I view my perspective on free will and determinism/causality as a
type of compatibilism, but a unique one informed by Misesian dualism. It
is no more spooky to refer to an actor’s “choice” than it is to
conceptually distinguish the mind from the brain or the person from his
body, as it is undeniably a conceptually useful, and probably
unavoidable, way to characterize what other humans do.<a

<p>As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes noted:</p>
<p>An act is always a voluntary muscular contraction, and nothing else.
The chain of physical sequences which it sets in motion or directs to
the plaintiff’s harm is no part of it, and very generally a long train
of such sequences intervenes…. When a man commits an assault and battery
with a pistol, his only act is to contract the muscles of his arm and
forefinger in a certain way, but it is the delight of elementary writers
to point out what a vast series of physical changes must take place
before the harm is done.</p>

<li id="fn333"><p> The causal aspect of a prohibited act of aggression
is sometimes made explicit and is sometimes simply implicit. As an
example of the former, see New York Penal Law §105.05: “Conspiracy in
the fifth degree,” which provides:</p>
<p>A person is guilty of conspiracy in the fifth degree when, with
intent that conduct constituting:</p>
<p>1. a felony be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to
engage in <em>or cause</em> the performance of such conduct; or</p>
<p>2. a crime be performed, he, being over eighteen years of age, agrees
with one or more persons under sixteen years of age to engage in <em>or
cause</em> the performance of such conduct.</p>
<p>New York Penal Law §105.05 (https://perma.cc/FEV5-KBK3; emphasis
added).</p>
<p>In the case of torts, the mandate is: do not unreasonably act so as
to <em>cause harm</em> to another. In crimes such as rape, theft, and
burglary, the causal aspect may only be implied. But theft occurs, for
example, when the actor’s voluntary act <em>causes</em> movement
(asportation) of the goods stolen. Rape includes the crime of
<em>causing</em> another’s penis to be inserted into victim, and so

<p>To be clear, there is a distinction between the nonhuman scarce means
of action employed by actors, and other humans employed to help achieve
one’s ends. Only the former are ownable things. (See “A Libertarian
Theory of Contract: Title Transfer, Binding Promises, and
Inalienability” (ch. 9) and “Selling Does Not Imply Ownership, and

equivocation surrounding the term <em>scarce</em>, e.g., in the
intellectual property context (“good ideas are pretty scarce, so IP must
be legitimate”), in recent years I have tried to emphasize the rivalrous
or “conflictable” nature of the types of resources, things, or entities
that may be subject to property rights. See Kinsella, “On
Conflictability and Conflictable Resources,”

<p>An intervening cause will generally absolve the tortfeasor of
liability for the victim’s injury <em>only</em> <em>if</em> the event is
deemed a <em>superseding cause</em>. A <em>superseding cause</em> is an
<em>unforeseeable</em> intervening cause. By contrast, a
<em>foreseeable</em> intervening cause typically does <em>not</em> break
the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible
for the victim’s injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable
result.</p>
<p>For example…, if a defendant had carelessly spilled gasoline near a
pile of cigarette butts in an alley behind a bar, the fact that a bar
patron later carelessly threw a cigarette butt into the gasoline would
be deemed a foreseeable intervening cause, and would not absolve the
defendant of tort liability. However, if the bar patron
<em>intentionally</em> threw the cigarette butt into the gasoline
because he wanted to see it ignite, this intentional act would likely be
deemed unforeseeable, and therefore superseding.</p>

<p>[I]f we assume that Hitler did not murder anyone and, on top of that,
we assume for the sake of argument that Hitler had no other partaking in
initiations of force whether it was receipt of stolen goods or rape,
could Hitler be held to account for the murders that took place under
his watch?</p>
<p>In this Steel-Man-case scenario, Hitler would not be culpable for an
initiation of force. Rather, the people who did the actual initiations
and threats of force would be culpable, whether it was just pointing
guns to threaten people into railcars or using physical violence to
massacre people in concentration camps.</p>
<p>Jack Lloyd, “Justice and Voluntaryism,” <em>Voluntaryist
Association</em> (Dec. 7, 2022; https://perma.cc/2FZJ-U4EX).</p>
<p>The perversity of the joke noted in the text illustrates why this
reasoning is flawed. Imagine a Jewish woman conscripted to be Hitler’s
cleaning lady at the height of World War II, with her family being
imprisoned in a concentration camp. If one night she is cleaning
Hitler’s office while he is there alone and has the chance to kill him,
some libertarians literally argue this action would be murder since
Hitler is not himself an aggressor (!). I trust the absurdity and
perverseness of this position is apparent to most readers. <em>Of
course</em> the enslaved Jewish woman, in the hypothetical above, has a
right to kill Hitler, in self-defense and defense of others, implying
Hitler must be an aggressor, even though he “only gives orders.” Thus,
not all speech-acts are nonaggressive.</p>

<li id="fn350"><p> Somewhat similarly, Rothbard also tried to ameliorate
the unacceptable consequences of some of his contract views in <em>The
Ethics of Liberty</em>. He first argues (correctly, to my mind; see “A
Libertarian Theory of Contract” (ch. 9)) that voluntary slavery
contracts are invalid because the human body or will is inalienable.
(See ibid., Part III.C.) Yet he also then argues that failure to repay a
debt is “implicit theft” and that, therefore, in principle, debtor’s
prison is justified. (Rothbard is in error here, as I discuss in ibid.)
If someone may be imprisoned for failing to pay a contractual debt (on
the basis of the “implicit theft” characterization), this is just
another way one can, in fact, alienate one’s body by contract. In other
words, the positions “the body is inalienable” and “debtor’s prison is
justified” are contradictory. Perhaps sensing this, Rothbard tries to
minimize the latter view by simply asserting that imprisoning an
“implicit thief”—the debtor—is somehow necessarily disproportionate and
“excessive” punishment. See ibid., Part III.D.</p>
<p>Lloyd, quoted in note 31, above, also tries to minimize the
implications of absolving a Hitler from liability. He writes:</p>
<p>But that Hitler may escape a direct consequence over physical
initiations of force does not mean, “no justice.” … Justice is brought
by holding the order-followers accountable for their harms and by
exposing Hitler’s role…. The social and economic ramifications are
themselves a toll on him and his ability [to] live and should not be
discounted in the calculation.</p>
<p>For some of us, probably most of us, this is pretty thin gruel.<a

<p>According to Van Dun’s interpretation of my viewpoint, they [Hitler,
Stalin, et al] would therefore be “guilty” of no more than exercising
their free speech rights, and should be considered innocent of all
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>However, Van Dun reckons in the absence of threats. To reiterate, the
libertarian legal code proscribes not only invasive acts, but also
intimidation. Hitler, Stalin, et al. were not merely engaging in their
free speech rights. Rather, they were issuing orders to their
subordinates to maim and kill innocent people. Implicit in these
commands was the threat that if they were not obeyed, those who failed
to carry out these orders would be summarily dealt with.</p>
<p>Here Block seems to imply that “orders” necessarily include a threat.
In this case, the “orders” exception noted above seems to collapse into
the first exception, where the instigator threatens of coerces the
intermediary. But see Walter Block, “Reply to Frank van Dun’s ‘Natural

conjunction “or,” although it is somewhat ambiguous: “A gang leader does

not, they will be visited with physical sanctions.”<a href="#fnref353"

<p>From Rothbard's point of view, inciting to crime “is a pure exercise
of a man’s right to speak without being thereby implicated in the crime.
On the other hand, it is obvious that if Green happened to be

crimes</em>, and that then Green <em>told them to proceed</em>, he would
then be just as implicated in the crimes as are the others—more so, if
he were the mastermind who headed the criminal gang.”</p>
<p>Mortellaro also seems to advance a view which would absolve a mafia
boss or a Hitler in some cases, but then tries to make an exception in
cases of conspiracy or collaboration. See Mortellaro, “Causation and
Responsibility,” p. 16:</p>
<p>With regard to the necessity of the inciter, it would seem that the
hitman has the ability and means to engage in the crime without the help
of the inciter. Indeed, unless the inciter plays some other role—if he
helps hide the hitman from the authorities, drives the getaway car,
picks the lock on the target’s door, or something actually involved in
the crime itself, then and only then would he have been necessary for
the hitman to carry out the crime.<a href="#fnref354"

<p>Second, and not unrelated, the rioter is a human being, presumably
with free will; no one could say the same of a piece of lead. Third,
there are many cases in which an inciter incites until his lungs give
out, and no subsequent riot takes place, further attesting to the
distinction between free will and inanimate objects that mars Van Dun’s
analogy. But, apart from a misfire, bullets always discharge when fired.
According to Van Dun, the inciter “fires off” the rioter in much the
same way as the shooter does to the bullet. This is not at all the case.
To be logically consistent, Van Dun would have to hold the inciter
guilty of a crime even when no subsequent riot ensued.</p>
<p>Ibid., p. 16 (footnote omitted). I have already argued above that the
“free will” of the rioter does not mean the inciter is innocent; after
all, in other cases in which Block does believe the instigator is
liable, such as coercion or monetary payment, the intermediary still has
free will. But consider here Block’s final sentence, criticizing Van Dun
because someone who <em>attempts</em> to incite a riot that does not
happen, under Van Dun’s approach, would presumably still be guilty of a
crime. Block points this out as if this conclusion is obviously wrong or
unjust. But why is it wrong? If you try to shoot someone but miss, you
can still be guilty of attempted murder, a lesser crime than actual
murder, perhaps, but a punishable offense nonetheless. The libertarian
view of rights and aggression prohibits not only trespass, battery, and
so on, but also <em>assault</em> (which is <em>attempted</em> battery,
or putting someone in fear of receiving a battery), <em>threats</em>,
and the like. See “A Libertarian Theory of Punishment and Rights”
(ch. 5), Part IV.F, “Why Assault, Threats, and Attempts Are Aggression”;
and Kinsella, “Stalking and Threats as Aggression,”

a mob up into lynching someone, even if he fails, might be guilty of

that Block generally opposes the notion that speech acts (such as
incitement) can give rise to liability, except for the <em>ad hoc</em>
exceptions of monetary payment and coercion, yet in his view of
voluntary slavery, the uttering of the words “I hereby promise to be
your slave” justify the “master’s” use of force against the purported
“slave”—as if his words had committed a type of aggression against the

<li id="fn372"><p> This argument should not be conflated with Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes’s famous (and flawed) example of liability for
shouting “Fire” in a crowded theater, which he used to argue that First
Amendment free speech rights are not absolute. As Rothbard notes:</p>
<p>[C]ouching the analysis in terms of a “right to free speech” instead
of property rights leads to confusion and the weakening of the very
concept of rights. The most famous example is Justice Holmes’s
contention that no one has the right to shout “Fire” falsely in a
crowded theater, and <em>therefore</em> that the right to freedom of
speech cannot be absolute, but must be weakened and tempered by
considerations of “public policy.” And yet, if we analyze the problem in
terms of <em>property</em> rights we will see that no weakening of the
absoluteness of rights is necessary.</p>
<p>For, logically, the shouter is either a patron or the theater owner.
If he is the theater owner, he is violating the property rights of the
patrons in quiet enjoyment of the performance, for which he took their
money in the first place. If he is another patron, then he is violating
both the property right of the patrons to watching the performance
<em>and</em> the property right of the owner, for he is violating the
terms of his being there. For those terms surely include not violating
the owner’s property by disrupting the performance he is putting on. In
either case, he may be prosecuted as a violator of property rights;
therefore, when we concentrate on the <em>property</em> rights involved,
we see that the Holmes case implies no need for the law to weaken the
absolute nature of rights.</p>

of “social causation.” Van Dun, “Against Libertarian Legalism,” pp. 64,
79. Block, in responding to some of Van Dun’s criticisms, writes:</p>
<p>The essence of Van Dun’s criticism of my article is that while all
physically invasive acts must be characterized as unjustified aggression
and prohibited by law, there is a second type of aggression, call it for
want of a better term “mental aggression,” which should also, in
addition to physical aggression, be considered legally illicit. Examples
of this, as we shall analyze below, include libel, lying, making false
accusations to the police, blackmail, “hate” speech, and negative
“social causation” such as incitement to riot, gang leaders or dictators
ordering their henchmen to commit crimes (of physical invasion),
etc….</p>
<p>Further instances of “mental aggression” might include shunning,
boycotting, cutting “dead,” refusing to deal with, buy from, sell to,
etc. It is difficult to see how any libertarian could favor the outlawry
of such behavior, but this would seem to be the implication of Van Dun’s
theory.</p>

it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have

the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional

When recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an element
of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is
not within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the case of

negligent torts that result in similar damage. Keep in mind that
punishment is an action, and a fully intentional one; it is not
negligent, or “partially intentional.” Punishment is an intentional
action that aims at punishing the body of the aggressor or tortfeasor.
In punishing a criminal, the punishment is justified because the
criminal himself intentionally violated the borders of the victim; the
punishment is therefore symmetrical (see “A Libertarian Theory of
Punishment and Rights” (ch. 5)). However, in punishing a mere
tortfeasor, the punishment is fully intentional, but the negligent
action being punished is only “partially” intentional, so to speak. In
order to make the punishment or response to a torfeasor proportionate,
since the tort was only partly intentional but the punishment will be
fully intentional, therefore, the damages (intentionally) inflicted (or
extracted) have to be reduced to some degree to make the punishment more
proportionate overall. As an example, if a criminal intentionally
murders someone, it would (in principle) be symmetrical for the victim’s
heirs to have him killed. But if a tortfeasor accidentally kills
someone, the punishment inflicted on him would have to be an order of
magnitude lower since his action was not fully intentional while that of
the punisher would be. Walter Block argues that if it were
technologically feasible to “suck the life out of” a criminal, or even a
negligent tortfeasor, to bring the victim back to life, this would be
justified. See Roy Whitehead &amp; Walter Block, “Taking the Assets of
Criminals to Compensate Victims of Violence: A Legal and Philosophical
Approach,” <em>J. Law in Society</em> 5 (2003;
http://www.walterblock.com/publications/): 229–253, p. 249 <em>et
seq.</em> Since this is so far-fetched and probably would never be
possible, I state no opinion on this argument but do not find it
relevant.</p>

<li id="fn385"><p> As noted previously, technically speaking, property
rights are best viewed as rights to <em>exclude others</em> from using a
resource rather than a right to use; and the term property, to be
precise, should be used to refer to the (ownership) relationship between
a human owner and an object (scarce, conflictable resource), not to the
owned material object itself. Thus, your car is not your “property”; you
have a property right <em>in</em> your car. On all this, and on the use
of terms like conflictable or rivalrous to refer to ownable scarce
resources, see Kinsella, “On Conflictability and Conflictable
Resources,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 31, 2022); “<em>Against
Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years: Looking Back and Looking
Forward” (ch. 15), at n.62; and “What Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2), at
n.5.</p>
<p>Even more precisely still, property rights can be conceived of as
rights <em>between human actors</em>, but <em>with respect to particular
resources</em>, although this distinction makes little difference for
our present purposes. On this point see, e.g., Emanuele Martinelli, “On
Whether We Own What We Think” (draft, 2019;
https://www.academia.edu/93535130/On_Whether_We_Own_What_We_Think), p. 6

Pejovich, “Towards an Economic Theory of the Creation and Specification
of Property Rights,” in Henry G. Manne, ed., <em>Economics of Legal
Relationships</em> (West Group, 1975), p. 40 (emphasis in original)

but, rather as <em>the behavioural relations among men that arise from
the existence of things and pertain to their use</em>.”; quoted in
Boudewijn Bouckaert, “What is Property?”, <em>Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub.

sometimes said that property is a relation between a person and a thing,
but that’s confused. Property rights are relations between people. If I
legitimately own something (rather than merely possessing it, as might
be true of stolen goods), everyone else on the planet has an obligation
to keep their hands off it. If that’s going to be true, then there has
to be some reasonable basis for thinking that they have that
obligation.”); and Alex Kozinski, “Of Profligacy, Piracy, and Private
Property,” <em>Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y</em>. 13, no. 1 (Winter 1990;

<p>But what is property? That is not an easy question to answer. I
remember sitting in my first-year property course on the first day of
class when the professor … asked the fundamental question: What are
property rights? … I threw up my hand and without even waiting to be
called on I shouted out, “Property rights define the relationship
between people and their property.”</p>
<p>Professor Krier stopped dead in his tracks, spun around, and gave me
a long look. Finally he said: “That’s very peculiar, Mr. Kozinski. Have
you always had relations with inanimate objects? Most people I know have
relations with other people.”</p>
<p>That was certainly not the last time I said something really dumb in
class, but the lesson was not lost on me. Property rights are, of
course, a species of relationships between people. At the minimum, they
define the degree to which individuals may exclude other individuals
from the use and enjoyment of their goods and services….</p>

to the resource, i.e., is entitled to use it. It is a property right
since it becomes an extension of the owner’s ability to interact with
the world, i.e., one of his attributes or “properties”; he is the
proprietor or has a proprietary interest in the thing. As Bouckaert
writes:</p>
<p>[T]he definition of property is simultaneously simple and complex. It
is simple because we can distinguish a generally accepted common-sense
notion of property; that is, something that belongs to somebody in a
legitimate way, something that is “proper” to somebody.</p>

<li id="fn390"><p> Invasions of the borders—uninvited use—of others’
owned resources by a tortfeasor or aggressor results in a transfer of
rights from the wrongdoer to the victim. By attacking someone, the
aggressor transfers some rights in his body and/or property to the
victim, for purposes of defense, punishment, and/or restitution. See
“Inalienability and Punishment: A Reply to George Smith” (ch. 10);
“Defending Argumentation Ethics” (ch. 7); and<br />
“A Libertarian Theory of Punishment and Rights” (ch. 5). In causing
damage to another’s property through negligence (the commission of a
tort), the tortfeasor becomes liable to the victim. In both cases, the
wrongdoer loses rights, not because of any voluntary agreement, but by
virtue of his action. Re negligence, see Kinsella, “The Libertarian
Approach to Negligence, Tort, and Strict Liability: Wergeld and Partial
Wergeld,” <em>Mises Economics Blog</em> (Sep. 1, 2009).<a

<p>Contract must be considered as an agreed-upon exchange between two
persons of two goods, present or future…. Failure to fulfill contracts
must be considered as theft of other’s property. Thus, when a debtor
purchases a good in exchange for a promise of future payment, the good
cannot be considered his property until the agreed contract has been
fulfilled and payment is made…. An important consideration here is that
contract not be enforced because a promise has been made that is not
kept. It is not the business of the enforcing agency or agencies in the
free market to enforce promises merely because they are promises; its
business is to enforce against theft of property, and contracts are
enforced because of the implicit theft involved. Evidence of a promise
to pay property is an enforceable claim, because the possessor of this
claim is, in effect, the owner of the property involved, and failure to
redeem the claim is equivalent to theft of the property.</p>

that the USD system is a fiat currency, and it is not clear anymore what
exactly is “owned” by people holding dollar bills of various
denominations or federal-government insured bank-accounts with fiat
dollars. The reader can substitute owned gold coins instead of fiat for
conceptual clarity. As I have argued, even bitcoins are not properly
ownable, and the status of ownership of state-created fiat money is even
murkier. See Kinsella, “Nobody Owns Bitcoin,”

represents title to a certain amount of something ownable, like
gold.</p>

<li id="fn416"><p> Part of the confusion here stems from conflating the
economic-descriptive-<em>wertfrei</em> realm and the normative realm of
law and rights. In human action—in praxeological terms—there is
employment of means, which requires control of resources. Every action
requires choice among possible ends and this requires losing the
next-highest valued end, which is reflected in the economic concept of
opportunity cost. This could be viewed as a primordial type of exchange,
that even Crusoe could engage in: he “exchanges” the chance to spend a
night in leisure for the opportunity to catch more fish in the future
(by spending his Friday night, no pun intended, to make a fishing net).
In society, <em>A</em> might exchange something he controls with
<em>B</em>; each benefits <em>ex ante</em>. When there are property
rights and a developed legal system, then sales, exchange, and so on
have a legal aspect and exchange refers to legal owners transferring
their ownership over ownable, scarce resources to someone else, usually
reciprocally and conditionally.<a href="#fnref416" class="footnote-back"

<p>[A]s late as the eighteenth century contract law was still dominated
by a <em>title theory of exchange</em>…</p>
<p>To modern eyes, the most distinctive feature of eighteenth century
contract law is the subordination of contract to the law of property. In
Blackstone’s <em>Commentaries</em> contract appears for the first time
in Book II, which is devoted entirely to the law of property. Contract
is classified among such subjects as descent, purchase, and occupancy as
one of the many modes of transferring title to a specific thing….</p>
<p>As a result of the subordination of contract to property, eighteenth
century jurists endorsed a title theory of contractual exchange
according to which a contract functioned to transfer title to the
specific thing contracted for. Thus, Blackstone wrote that where a
seller fails to deliver goods on an executory contract, “the vendee may
seize the goods, or have an action against the vendor for detaining
them.” Similarly, in the first English treatise on contract, Powell
wrote of the remedy for failure to deliver stock on an executory
contract as being one for specific performance.</p>

<li id="fn425"><p> The theory for transferring property advocated herein
bears a conceptual resemblance to the common-law practice of
“quitclaiming” and also to the Roman law doctrine of
“<em>traditio</em>.” <em>Traditio</em> was a legal mechanism used to
transfer ownership of certain types of <em>things</em> (<em>res nec
mancipi</em>) by physically transferring possession or control of the
thing, coupled with intent to transfer. See, e.g., W.W. Buckland, <em>A
Text Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian</em>, 3d ed. rev’d by
Peter Stein, reprint with corrections (Cambridge University Press,
1975), at LXXXIII, pp. 226–27; also Gaius, <em>Institutes of Roman

I.)</p>
<p>As for quitclaim deeds: conventional conveyances of property operate
by a deed, but a quitclaim deed operates by way of a <em>release</em>,
similar to abandonment. It is intended to pass any title or right owned
by the transferor to the transferee, without warranting that anything
is, in fact, owned. See Gregory Michael Anding, Comment, “Does This
Piece Fit?: A Look at the Importation of the Common-Law Quitclaim Deed
and After-Acquired Title Doctrine into Louisiana’s Civil Code,” <em>La.
L. Rev.</em> 55, no. 1 (Summer 1994;
https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/lalrev/vol55/iss1/8/): 159–77; and
<em>Black’s Law Dictionary</em>, defining “quitclaim.” The quitclaim is
a type of abandonment “in favor” of another, which effectively functions
as a conveyance or transfer of the title. See also Louisiana Civil Code,
art. 2502:</p>
<p>Art. 2502. Transfer of rights to a thing</p>
<p>A person may transfer to another whatever rights to a thing he may
then have, without warranting the existence of any such rights. In such
a case the transferor does not owe restitution of the price to the
transferee in case of eviction, nor may that transfer be rescinded for
lesion.</p>
<p>Such a transfer does not give rise to a presumption of bad faith on
the part of the transferee and is a just title for the purposes of
acquisitive prescription.</p>
<p>If the transferor acquires ownership of the thing after having
transferred his rights to it, the after-acquired title of the transferor
does not inure to the benefit of the transferee.<a href="#fnref425"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn426"><p> The owner need not wait until the owner-to-be has
possession to make the transfer. For example, the owner could make his
abandonment conditional upon the desired recipient possessing the
property.<a href="#fnref426" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn429"><p> Note: In my original article, first presented in 1999
and published in 2003, in the above section, I criticized some aspects
of Rothbard’s argument for inalienability. I now think it is possible
that his approach is more compatible with my own than I originally
realized. I retain in this chapter most of the original critique in this

<li id="fn430"><p> Rothbard, “Property Rights and the Theory of
Contracts,” p. 133, emphasis added. But other passages indicate he did
not think this applied to bodies:</p>
<p>The basic reason is that the only valid transfer of title of
ownership in the free society is the case where the property is, in fact
and in the nature of man, alienable by man. All physical property owned
by a person is <em>alienable</em>, i.e., in natural fact it can be given
or transferred to the ownership and control of another party. I can give
away or sell to another person my shoes, my house, my car, my money,
etc. But there are certain vital things which, in natural fact and in
the nature of man, are inalienable, i.e., they <em>cannot</em> in fact
be alienated, even voluntarily. Specifically, a person cannot alienate
his <em>will</em>, more particularly his control over his own mind and
body. Each man has control over his own mind and body. Each man has
control over his own will and person, and he is, if you wish, “stuck”
with that inherent and “inalienable ownership. Since his will and
control over his own person are inalienable, then so also are his
<em>rights to</em> control that person and will. That is the ground for
the famous position of the Declaration of Independence that man’s
natural rights are inalienable; that is, they cannot be surrendered,
even if the person wishes to do so.</p>

debtor does not have the funds on hand to pay the creditor.” Evers,
“Toward a Reformulation of the Law of Contracts,” p. 11 n. 5 (emphasis

debtor has no funds? And where is the “fraud”? David Boaz, <em>The

<li id="fn464"><p> A second, less significant point, relates to Smith’s
doubts about the propriety of killing or imprisoning someone who has
shown himself to be a “standing threat” to others. Smith notes:
“Objective standards and procedures seem problematic in this case, to
say the least. (Perhaps I am lacking in imagination; if so, I have
little doubt that more imaginative libertarians will come to my aid with
ingenious solutions.)” Smith, “A Killer’s Right to Life,” p. 69. Barnett
seems to have done just this. Barnett argues that the principle of
“extended self-defense” justifies imprisoning (sometimes for life) those
who have made a sufficiently unambiguous communication of a threat to
another. Barnett, <em>The Structure of Liberty</em>, pp. 188–193. On
pp. 213–14, Barnett points out that because of problems of enforcement
abuse and rule of law considerations, however, this remedy should be
limited to those persons who have communicated a threat to others by
their past <em>criminal</em> behavior (i.e., those who have been
convicted, perhaps multiple times, of a crime), and only if the previous
crimes had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. See also Randy E.
Barnett, “Getting Even: Restitution, Preventive Detention, and the
Tort/Crime Distinction,” <em>Boston U. L. Rev.</em> 76 (February/April
1996; www.randybarnett.com/pre-2000): 157–68. I believe this limitation
on the principle of extended self-defense is unduly restrictive, but
that is neither here nor there. See, e.g., my post “Stalking and Threats
as Aggression,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 10, 2021).<a

<li id="fn465"><p> Smith says Jeremy Bentham held the theory of
“inalienable rights” to be “nonsense upon stilts,” and thus wonders if
anyone who rejects inalienable rights must follow Bentham to his
anti-libertarian conclusions. Smith, “Inalienable Rights?”, p. 51. Yet
Bentham said that <em>rights</em> were nonsense, and that
<em>natural</em> rights were nonsense upon stilts. He did not use the
modifier “inalienable” that Smith subtly puts in his mouth (though he
does use the adjective “imprescriptible”). Jeremy Bentham, “Anarchical
Fallacies,” in <em>Human Rights</em>, A.I. Melden, ed. (Belmont, Calif.:
Wadsworth Publishing, 1970), p. 28. Bentham opposed natural rights on
the grounds that they were anterior to government, and thus his
criticism is applicable to both alienable and inalienable natural
rights. Thus, one can oppose Bentham’s rights-skepticism by being in
favor of <em>alienable</em> natural rights, which means that rejecting
inalienability does not mean following Bentham down a non-libertarian
path, as long as one advocates <em>natural</em> rights.<a
href="#fnref465" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn466"><p> Many, probably most, libertarians maintain that
rights are strictly “alienable,” i.e., <em>some</em> actions are
sufficient to alienate rights (although they usually also maintain that
rights are “inalienable” <em>sometimes</em>, e.g., promising to be
another’s slave, as opposed to the commission of an act of aggression,
does not serve to alienate rights; see section “Inalienability,” and
note 34, below. In fact, any libertarian who advocates the right to
punish (or, really, even the right to self-defense) at least implicitly
endorses that rights can be alienated, to some extent. See, e.g., Murray
N. Rothbard, “Self-Defense,” in <em>The Ethics of Liberty</em> (New
York: New York University Press, 1998;
https://mises.org/library/right-self-defense), p. 81, where he says “the
criminal … loses his right <em>to the extent</em> that he has deprived
another man of his” (emphasis in original); Barnett, “Contract Remedies
and Inalienable Rights,” p. 186 (quoted in note 11 above); Roger Pilon,

saying that a man has forfeited his own rights (to the extent of the
aggression he has committed) in attacking the rights of others? … It may
be very difficult to translate into concrete terms the amount of
aggression, and of resulting restraint; but all just law seems to be the
effort to do this. We punish a man in a certain way if he has inflicted
an injury which lays me up for a day; in another way if he takes my
life…. [T]he punishment or redress … should be measured by the amount of
aggression; in other words that the aggressor—after a rough
fashion—loses as much liberty as that of which he has deprived
others.”), also ibid., pp. 39–40; also other sources quoted in “A

<li id="fn469"><p> The following thought-experiment, from the
ever-fertile libertarian mind of Walter Block (as relayed to me by Joe
Salerno), illustrates why a proponent of restitution must, in principle,
be willing to support capital punishment as well. Block asks, what if it
were possible to actually provide true restitution to a murder victim—to
restore his life—by connecting a “life-sucking” machine to the murderer
and transferring his life essence to the dead victim? This would bring
the dead victim back at the cost of the killer’s life. Surely, a
restitutionist would have to be in favor of this, as it is simply a type
of force used to enforce restitution, and the purpose of restitution is
to “restore” the victim. But what is the difference, in principle,
between killing the aggressor to “restore” the victim and killing the
aggressor as punishment? In both cases, the aggressor is intentionally
killed, against his will, in response to his earlier aggression. It
would seem that in this case, the restitutionist, like the
retributionist, supports executing murderers, and thus cannot claim that
a murderer has, in principle, an inalienable right to life. See Walter
Block &amp; Roy Whitehead, “Taking the Assets of Criminals to Compensate
Victims of Violence: A Legal and Philosophical Approach,” <em>Wayne
State U. L. Sch. J. Law Soc.</em> 5 (2003,

<li id="fn475"><p> Another error lies in the very title of Smith’s
article: “A Killer’s Right to Life.” Under libertarianism, one has a
right against the <em>initiation</em> of force—against aggression. But
punishment is not <em>initiatory</em> force; it is force <em>in
response</em> to initiated force. Part of Smith’s confusion here lies in
thinking that libertarianism upholds some actual right to <em>life</em>.
There is no right to life. There is no right to “free speech.” The
ability to enjoy your life or engage in speech is a consequence of a
system where your property rights are respected. As I wrote
previously:</p>
<p>If I own … 100 acres of land, I can prance around naked on it, not
because the land is imbued with some “right-to-prance-naked,” but
because I own the land and it does not (necessarily) violate the
property rights of others for me to use my property in this fashion.</p>
<p>Kinsella, <em>Against Intellectual Property</em> (Auburn, Ala.: Mises
Institute, 2008), p. 53. See also Rothbard’s criticism of the “right to
free speech” in Murray N. Rothbard, “Human Rights as Property Rights,”
in <em>The Ethics of Liberty</em>
(https://mises.org/library/human-rights-property-rights).</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no abstract “right to life.” There is a right
against aggression, that is, to not have one’s property rights violated.
That is why libertarians advocate the non-aggression axiom or principle,
not the “life axiom.” An innocent person can use his right against
aggression to protect his life, if he so chooses; or he may commit
suicide or waste his life in other ways. Thus, an innocent person may be
said to have a right to life, if it is kept in mind that the so-called
“right to life” is merely derivative of—a consequence of—the primary
right against aggression, just as the right to free speech is derivative
of the right to own private property and the right against aggression.
An aggressor, on the other hand, no longer has a right against the
imposition of force, and thus his life is in peril. The aggressor,
therefore, no longer has a “right to his life,” such that it was.<a

supplements Barnett’s theory of a restitution-based justice system,
since Barnett nowhere specifies any objective standards or criteria by
which a judge or jury is to determine the amount of restitution a victim
is to receive for a non-economic crime like murder, rape, and the like.
He specifies only that the aggressor must “compensate” the victim for
the “harm caused,” to “restore” the victim. Barnett, <em>Structure of
Liberty</em>, pp. 161, 187. Of course, how much compensation is needed
to compensate for various violent crimes is a difficult question, and,
of course, no amount of restitution can ever “restore” a murdered
victim, nor can it “undo” other types of battery.<a href="#fnref482"

Suppose that Murphy agrees to have a computer chip implanted in his
brain, which will enable me to control him with a joystick, moving him
around like a robot. (Perhaps in exchange for this dubious privilege, I
have agreed to pay one million dollars to his destitute family.) Here,
Murphy has voluntarily extinguished his moral agency, not transferred it
to me. What he has transferred is physical control over his body, which
becomes my property after he has taken leave of it. Therefore, since the
body, like all physical objects, is transferable, I regard this kind of
slavery contract as possible and valid.</p>
<p>See also Barnett, <em>Structure of Liberty</em>, 78 &amp; n. 39, who
writes:</p>
<p>Suppose that Ann consented to transfer partial or complete control of
her body to Ben. Absent some physiological change in Ann (caused,
perhaps, by voluntarily and knowingly ingesting some special drug or
undergoing psycho-surgery) there is no way for such a commitment to be
carried out…. Arthur Kuflik offers these examples to undercut this type
of argument for inalienability. See Arthur Kuflik, “The Inalienability
of Autonomy,” <em>Philosophy and Public Affairs</em> 13, no. 4 (1984):
271–98, p. 281: “This suggests that the impropriety of an
autonomy-abdicating agreement has more to do with the impropriety of
autonomy-abdication itself than with some general fact that we have no
right to make commitments we know we will be unable to keep.” But
arguments based on impropriety and one based on the impossibility of
such agreements are not mutually exclusive. Kuflik’s examples only show
that this reason for inalienability is <em>limited</em> to those
commitments to alienate the future control over one’s person which are
not made possible by mind-altering drugs, brainwashing techniques, or
psychosurgery.<a href="#fnref489" class="footnote-back"

Walter Block, on the other hand, would argue that the sale of one’s body
confers ownership of it to another person and that subsequent violence
against the sold body by the new owner is no more aggression than is
self-mutilation. I remain to be convinced by this line of argument,
primarily because there seems to be a relevant difference between the
rights related to one’s body and rights in homesteaded resources, due to
the different justifications for and nature of these rights. For more on
this, see “Selling Does Not Imply Ownership, and Vice-Versa: A

passengers from parachuting out in mid-flight. See Barnett,
<em>Structure of Liberty</em>, p. 81; also <em>idem</em>, “Rights and
Remedies in a Consent Theory of Contract,” in R.G. Frey &amp;
Christopher W. Morris, eds., <em>Liability and Responsibility: Essays in
Law and Morals</em> (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 163 n.52. The
reason the parachuting is arguably aggression is that this action can be
considered to be the <em>cause</em> of the physical harm that will
befall the passengers, much like one who shoots a gun or drops a bomb is
an aggressor. Alternatively, in the airplane example, it could be argued
that the ownership of the airplane is contractually granted in common to
the passengers for the duration of the flight, and they could thus use
force to stop the pilot from opening the door since they “own” it and do
not grant him permission to use it for this purpose.</p>

<li id="fn499"><p> See also Barnett, <em>Structure of Liberty</em>,
p. 82. There has been great confusion in the area of contract theory,
which has perhaps contributed to the confusion in inalienability
reasoning. For example, the “impossibility” reasoning seems to be based
on the groundless assumption that contracts are based on the concept of
“binding promises” or on an improper analogy between homesteadable
scarce resources, which can be acquired or abandoned, and rights against
aggression, which relate to one’s body. However, contracts need have
nothing to do with promises, and there is a difference between rights to
acquired external resources and rights to one’s body. For more on the
libertarian theory of contracts, see Randy E. Barnett, “A Consent Theory
of Contract,” <em>Colum. L. Rev.</em> 86 (1986;
www.randybarnett.com/pre-2000): 269; Rothbard, “Property Rights and the
Theory of Contracts”; Williamson M. Evers, “Toward a Reformulation of
the Law of Contracts,” <em>J. Libertarian Stud.</em> 1, no. 1 (Winter
1977; https://mises.org/library/toward-reformulation-law-contracts):
3–13. Thus, the framework for rights, punishment, and consent put
forward herein also has implications for other aspects of libertarian
theory, which cannot be addressed in detail here. For example, the view
of the unenforceability of slavery contracts also applies to contracts
for personal services, and, indeed, to all promises in general, and thus
to the theory of contracts. The theory of detrimental reliance is also
relevant here. In my view, promises <em>per se</em> are not enforceable,
and contracts are not best viewed as enforceable promises but as
exchanges or alienations of titles to acquired tangible property
external to one’s body. Some promises may be enforceable, due to
detrimental reliance, but only in cases where the reliance is not
circular, and thus plays a causal role in harming another, and such
enforceable promises are something different from contract itself. This
view of contracts, inalienability, and rights presented herein also has
implications for the distinction between the alienability of
homesteadable property versus the (limited) inalienability of rights
related to one’s body. Elaboration of these ideas will have to await a
subsequent article.</p>
<p>Author’s note (2023): I have chosen to retain the above note instead
of updating it. The original article was written in 1998–99, when I
anticipated I would need to elaborate on these ideas subsequently. This
is what I did. The next year, in 1999, I started developing the ideas
noted above, which ultimately became “A Libertarian Theory of Contract

<p>In a recent talk, one legal scholar claims that Rothbard, in

titles, as contrasted with the “relative” property titles of the common
law. See Wanjiru Njoya, “Defending Private Property: Principles of
Justice” (YouTube, March 27, 2023; https://youtu.be/jzamN_8l77k).
However, I believe the best reading of Rothbard is that the position he
supports is basically the relative property title system indicated
above. See Kinsella, “Rothbard on the ‘Original Sin’ in Land Titles:
1969 vs. 1974,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Nov. 5, 2014);

does not? First: Each person owns his physical body that only he and no
one else controls <em>directly</em> (I can control your body only
in-directly, by first directly controlling my body, and vice versa) and
that only he directly controls also in particular when
<em>discussing</em> <em>and arguing</em> the question at hand…. [A]s for
scarce resources that can be controlled <em>only</em> indirectly (that
must be appropriated with our own nature-given, i.e., un-appropriated,

person, who appropriated the resource in question <em>first</em> or who
acquired it through voluntary (conflict-free) exchange from its

<p>2.1 Aggression, Property and Contract</p>
<p>Aggression is the use, trespass against, or invasion of the borders
of another person’s owned resource (property) without the owner’s
consent; or the threat thereof. We oppose all acts of aggression as
illegitimate and unjust, whether committed by private actors or the
state.</p>
<p>Each person is the presumptive owner of his or her own body
(self-ownership), which right may be forfeited only as a consequence of
committing an act of aggression. Property rights in external, scarce
resources are determined in accordance with the principles of original
appropriation or homesteading (whereby a person becomes an owner of an
unowned resource by first use and transformation), contract (whereby the
owner consensually transfers ownership to another person), and
rectification (whereby an owner’s property rights in certain resources
are transferred to a victim of the owner’s tort, trespass, or aggression
to compensate the victim).<a href="#fnref530" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn538"><p> As Mises observed:</p>
<p>Regarded as a sociological category ownership appears as the power to
use economic goods. An owner is he who disposes of an economic good.</p>
<p>Thus the sociological and juristic concepts of ownership are
different. This, of course, is natural, and one can only be surprised
that the fact is still sometimes overlooked. From the sociological and
economic point of view, ownership is the <em>having</em> of the goods
which the economic aims of men require. This <em>having</em> may be
called the natural or original ownership, as it is purely a physical
relationship of man to the goods, independent of social relations
between men or of a legal order. The significance of the legal concept
of property lies just in this—that it differentiates between the
physical <em>has</em> and the legal <em>should have</em>. The Law
recognizes owners and possessors who lack this natural <em>having</em>,
owners who do not have, but ought to have. In the eyes of the Law “he
from whom has been stolen” remains owner, while the thief can never
acquire ownership. Economically, however, the natural having alone is
relevant, and the economic significance of the legal <em>should
have</em> lies only in the support it lends to the acquisition, the
maintenance, and the regaining of the natural <em>having</em>.</p>

§ 4:</p>
<p>Ownership means full control of the services that can be derived from
a good. This catallactic notion of ownership and property rights is not
to be confused with the legal definition of ownership and property
rights as stated in the laws of various countries. It was the idea of
legislators and courts to define the legal concept of property in such a
way as to give to the proprietor full protection by the governmental
apparatus of coercion and compulsion, and to prevent anybody from
encroaching upon his rights. As far as this purpose was adequately
realized, the legal concept of property rights corresponded to the
catallactic concept.<a href="#fnref538" class="footnote-back"

person exercises over a corporeal thing.” A.N. Yiannopoulos,

(https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Laws_Toc.aspx?folder=67&amp;level=Parent),
art. 3421 (“Possession is the <em>detention</em> or <em>enjoyment</em>

<li id="fn540"><p> Using possessives like “my” is just descriptive; it
does not imply ownership. Likewise, Robert LeFevre observed:</p>
<p>It is quite common for one or both spouses in a marriage contract to
presume that their opposite number is actually a possession of theirs.
Our language gives credence to this supposition for it is usual to hear
a man refer to his partner as “my wife.” She is not his in a property
sense.</p>

<li id="fn541"><p> Technically speaking a property right is not a right
to control a resource but a right to <em>exclude</em> others from using
the resource; and it is not exactly a relationship between owner and
thing, but between owner and other people, <em>with</em> <em>respect
to</em> the thing owned. But these nuances are not pertinent here. See
“What Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2), n.4; “A Libertarian Theory of
Contract” (ch. 9), n.1.<a href="#fnref541" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn542"><p> See references and quotes in “What Libertarianism Is”
(ch. 2), n.5. As discussed there, the civil law has a broad
understanding of the concept of a “thing,” which can be owned or the
subject of legal rights; see Louisiana Civil Code, art. 448: “Division
of things. Things are divided into common, public, and private;
corporeals and incorporeals; and movables and immovables.” Incidentally
this exhaustive classification schema implies that intellectual property
rights are (private) “incorporeal movables.” See “<em>Against
Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years” (ch. 15), Part IV.B, and

<li id="fn543"><p> For example, in Israel M. Kirzner, “Producer,
Entrepreneur, and the Right to Property,” <em>Reason Papers</em> No. 1
(Fall 1974; https://reasonpapers.com/archives/): 1–17, p. 6, Kirzner
uses the term “own” in the economic sense:</p>
<p>Day is sharply critical of Locke, denying that one can talk
significantly of owning labor (in the sense of “working”). Laboring, Day
contends, is an activity, “and although activities can be engaged in,
performed or done, they cannot be owned.” However, economists will find
Locke’s use of terms quite familiar and acceptable. Economists speak of
agents of production (in the sense of <em>stocks</em>), and of the
“services” of agents of production (in the flow sense). A man who “owns”
an agent of production is considered by economists to own, by that
token, also the services flowing from that agent. Again, by hiring the
services of a productive agent, a producer is considered by economists
to have acquired ownership of the service flow, by purchase from the
previous owner of that flow (i.e. the owner of the agent “itself”). In
speaking of owning the services of an employee, therefore, the economist
does not in fact have in mind the ownership of the <em>activity</em> of
working, nor the ownership of that which the activity of working
produces, nor even the ownership of the <em>capacity</em> for working.
Rather the economist is perceiving the employee as a stock of human
capital, capable of generating a flow of services. [citations omitted]<a

law to prevent an organization from calling its games the “Gay

<p>When the courts have to choose between depriving the trademark owners
of some of the “fruits of their labor,” on the one hand, or depriving
the public and competing manufacturers of the <em>ability to communicate
simply and accurately on the other</em>, the courts opt to sacrifice the
creators’ reward in favor of securing <em>the public’s liberty of

refer to what should more precisely be referred to as the state,
although, as I have argued elsewhere, to be precise, government (or the
institutions of governance) is conceptually distinct from the state. The
state commandeers various natural and private institutions in society,
such as communication, transportation, defense, education, healthcare,
and law and order (institutions of governance), and over time the
populace associates these institutions with the state. But just as
libertarians are only against state-provided roads and education, but
not against roads and education, we are not against “government,”
meaning institutions or law and order. We are against the state. We
anarchist libertarians are not for chaos and do not think law is
impossible without the state; indeed, we think true, just law is only
really possible without the state. Thus we anarchist libertarians do not
oppose law and order, or even “government,” properly understood.
Nonetheless, I sometimes use “government” in this book in the
conventional sense to more or less mean the state, to avoid tedium. See,
on this, “Libertarianism After Fifty Years: What Have We Learned?”
(ch. 25); Kinsella, “The Nature of the State and Why Libertarians Hate
It,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (May 3, 2010); <em>idem</em>, “The
State is not the government; we don’t own property; scarcity doesn’t
mean rare; coercion is not aggression,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em>
(Dec. 19, 2022);</p>
<p>Likewise, in this book I try to avoid or minimize using “property” to
refer to the object of property rights (the scarce resource owned) (see
“What Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2), n.5) and using “coercion” as a synonym
for aggression (Kinsella, “The Problem with ‘Coercion,’”
<em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Aug. 7, 2009) and “The State is not the
government; we don’t own property; scarcity doesn’t mean rare; coercion
is not aggression”), but sometimes retain the less-precise usage due to
the older usage employed in the source material and to avoid tedium.<a

hurt no one, to give every one his due.” J.A.C. Thomas, ed., trans.,

<li id="fn589"><p> Almost all of the virtues acclaimed by civilians—as
understood here as necessarily compatible with and supportive of
individual rights—are genuine, objectively valid virtues or standards
that the civil law must be judged by. However, the concept of
“democracy” is not in the same class as the other alleged virtues of the
civil law. Although the term “democracy” is widely misused today to
represent things such as self-determination, economic liberties, or
civil liberties, it actually denotes a type of polity whereby certain
rules are made by majority vote. Under democracy, nothing prevents a
majority from voting for whatever sort of tyrant or tyrannical laws that
they like. There is no guarantee, or even likelihood, that laws enacted
by a majority or their elected representatives will tend to be just—in
fact, it is unlikely, as argued below. <em>See</em> Part III.C.3, below

predictable, known ahead of time, and of “general applicability” is not
sufficient for law to be just. If this is your only criteria, you can

<li id="fn604"><p> As Professor Benson explains, without legislative
interference by non-judges, the</p>
<p>common law would grow gradually. It would grow and develop in the
same way that all customary law grows and develops, particularly as a
consequence of the mutual consent of parties entering into reciprocal
arrangements. For example, two parties may enter into a contract, but
something then occurs that the contract did not clearly account for. The
parties <em>agree</em> to call upon an arbitrator or mediator to help
lead them to a solution. The solution affects only those parties in the
dispute, but if it turns out to be effective and the same potential
conflict arises again, it may be <em>voluntarily</em> adopted by others.
In this way, the solution becomes part of customary law.</p>

it is problematic and intermixed with some of Hayek’s views that I now
disagree with on the knowledge problem and how the market functions. See

“spontaneous” in the text since it was in the original. I believe the

Problem with Legislation: James Carter v. the Field Codes.” When the job
of judges is primarily to interpret statutes—as is the case for most
federal judges interpreting federal law and the written Constitution,
since there is no federal common law (see <em>Erie Railroad Co. v.
Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64 (1938;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Railroad_Co._v._Tompkins)—then they
are acting as mere functionaries interpreting words, not doing justice,
since there is no reason to expect a document written by a government
committee (legislation, the Constitution) to have anything to do with
justice or natural rights. Thus, I have pointed out before that in this
sense, and to this extent, these “judges” are really fake judges, not
real judges.</p>

as if there were no such distinction as that which has been here pointed
out, and who seem to have scarcely the most distant comprehension that
there is a <em>natural code</em> discoverable by the light of reason, to
which alone reference ought to be had when any law … is brought into
question either for the purpose of enactment or repeal. Instead of
<em>reasoning like legislators</em>, such persons merely <em>contend as
lawyers</em>; they but inquire <em>what is</em>, or <em>what has
been</em>, not <em>what ought to be</em>; and, provided they can find a
<em>precedent</em>, think they have no need to trouble themselves with
any farther investigation as to right or wrong. They pronounce the two
cabalistic words, “vested right,” and think themselves at once
entrenched behind an impregnable fortress, without considering it as at

Although defamation (libel and slander) is not usually considered a type
of IP, I believe it should be, since arguments in favor of the
“reputation rights” that this law protects are similar to those of other
forms of IP, like trademark. See Kinsella, “Defamation Law and

thus the need for the establishment of property rules, i.e., rules
regarding people’s bodies, would exist. One is not used to thinking of
one’s own body in terms of a scarce good, but in imagining the most
ideal situation one could ever hope for, the Garden of Eden, it becomes
possible to realize that one’s body is indeed the prototype of a scarce
good for the use of which property rights, i.e., rights of exclusive
ownership, somehow have to be established, in order to avoid
clashes.</p>

resources, including not only material objects but also human bodies.
This usage draws on the civil law, in which the term “things” refers to
“material objects” that are “susceptible of appropriation”—that is, to
“the objects of patrimonial rights.” <em>See</em> Yiannopoulos,
<em>Louisiana Civil Law Treatise, Property</em>, §§ 12, 201; Louisiana

Rand Lexicon: Objectivism from A to Z</em>, Harry Binswanger, ed. (New
York: New American Library, 1986; https://perma.cc/L4YA-96CC).
Ironically, Objectivists often excoriate libertarians for having a
“context-less” concept of aggression—that is, that “aggression” or
“rights” are meaningless unless these concepts are embedded in the
larger philosophical framework of Objectivism—despite Galt’s
straightforward definition of aggression as the initiation of physical
force against others. However, there are distinctions to be drawn
between property rights in an actor’s body and in external resources
homesteaded by that actor or some previous owner. See, on this,

Property Rights: a response to Division by Zer0,” <em>Mises Economics

libertarian theory is that each person must be a self-owner, and that no
one has the right to interfere with such self-ownership” (p. 60), and
“What…aggressive violence means is that one man invades the property of
another without the victim’s consent. The invasion may be against a
man’s property in his person (as in the case of bodily assault), or
against his property in tangible goods (as in robbery or trespass)”
(p. 45). Hoppe writes:</p>
<p>If … an action is performed that uninvitedly invades or changes the
physical integrity of another person’s body and puts this body to a use
that is not to this very person’s own liking, this action … is called
<em>aggression</em>…. Next to the concept of action, <em>property</em>
is the most basic category in the social sciences. As a matter of fact,
all other concepts to be introduced in this chapter—aggression,
contract, capitalism and socialism—are definable in terms of property:
<em>aggression</em> being aggression against property, <em>contract</em>
being a nonaggressive relationship between property owners,
<em>socialism</em> being an institutionalized policy of aggression
against property, and <em>capitalism</em> being an institutionalized
policy of the recognition of property and contractualism.</p>

ultimate arbiter in every case of conflict, including conflicts
involving itself, and it allows no appeal above and beyond itself.
Furthermore, the state is an agency that exercises a territorial
monopoly of taxation. That is, it is an agency that unilaterally fixes

<li id="fn752"><p> “Grundnorm” was legal philosopher Hans Kelsen’s term
for the hypothetical basic norm or rule that serves as the basis or
ultimate source for the legitimacy of a legal system. See Hans Kelsen,
<em>General Theory of Law and State</em>, Anders Wedberg, trans.
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1949). I employ this term
to refer to the fundamental norms presupposed by civilized people, e.g.,
in argumentative discourse, which in turn imply libertarian political
norms.</p>
<p><em>That</em> the libertarian <em>grundnorms</em> are, in fact,
necessarily presupposed by all civilized people to the extent they are
civilized—during argumentative justification, that is—is shown by Hoppe
in his argumentation-ethics defense of libertarian rights. On this, see
Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</em>, chap. 7; “What

Proportionality” (ch. 5), at Part I and IV.G:</p>
<p>Civilized people are also concerned about <em>justifying</em>
punishment. They want to punish, but they also want to know that such
punishment is justified. They want to be able to punish legitimately….
Theories of punishment are concerned with justifying punishment, with
offering decent people who are reluctant to act immorally a reason why
they may punish others. This is useful, of course, for offering moral
people guidance and assurance that they may properly deal with those who
seek to harm them.<a href="#fnref752" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn753"><p> As Rothbard argues, there are only two alternatives
to self-ownership either:</p>
<p>1. a certain class of people, A, have the right to own another class,
B; or</p>
<p>2. everyone has the right to own his equal quota share of everyone
else.</p>
<p>The first alternative implies that, while class A deserves the rights
of being human, class B is in reality subhuman and, therefore, deserves
no such rights. But since they are indeed human beings, the first
alternative contradicts itself in denying natural human rights to one
set of humans. Moreover, allowing class A to own class B means that the
former is allowed to exploit and, therefore, to live parasitically at
the expense of the latter; but, as economics can tell us, this
parasitism itself violates the basic economic requirement for human
survival: production and exchange.</p>
<p>The second alternative, which we might call “participatory
communalism” or “communism,” holds that every man should have the right
to own his equal quota share of everyone else. If there are three
billion people in the world, then everyone has the right to own
one-three-billionth of every other person. In the first place, this
ideal itself rests upon an absurdity—proclaiming that every man is
entitled to own a part of everyone else and yet is not entitled to own
himself. Second, we can picture the viability of such a world—a world in
which no man is free to take any action whatever without prior approval
or indeed command by everyone else in society. It should be clear that
in this sort of “communist” world, <em>no one would be able to do
anything, and the human race would quickly perish</em>.</p>

<p>Outside of the Garden of Eden, in the realm of all-around scarcity,
the solution [to the problem of social order—the need for rules to
permit conflicts to be avoided] is provided by four interrelated rules…
First, every person is the proper owner of his own physical body. Who
else, if not Crusoe, should be the owner of Crusoe’s body? Otherwise,
would it not constitute a case of slavery, and is slavery not unjust as
well as uneconomical?<a href="#fnref757" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn758"><p> See “How We Come to Own Ourselves” (ch. 4). Note that
if an agent <em>A</em> has committed an act of aggression against
<em>B</em>, as discussed in note 21, above, then <em>B</em>’s claim to
be able to do things to <em>A</em>’s body without <em>A</em>’s
permission <em>would</em> be making a distinction between <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>, but one grounded in the nature of things. As long as
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> have not attacked each other, there is no
<em>relevant</em> distinction between them, rendering any unequal
allocation of rights between them (such as <em>B</em> can own or hit
<em>A</em>, but not vice-versa) non-universalizable, particularistic,
and unacceptable in genuine argumentation. But matters are different if
<em>A</em> has forcefully invaded <em>B</em>’s body without <em>B</em>’s
consent. In this case we could say <em>A</em> is estopped from denying
<em>B</em>’s similar right to invade <em>A</em>’s body, that is, to
retaliate or defend himself. For similar reasons, critics of Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics who claim that the very possibility of a master
arguing with his slave invalidates argumentation ethics are incorrect.
In the case of chattel slavery, the master would be unable to
argumentatively justify his use of force against the slave. He would be
engaged in a contradiction: only peaceful, mutually-rights respecting
norms can be argumentatively justified, because of the normatively
peaceful presuppositions of argumentation itself; yet at the same time
the master would be employing dominating force against the slave. The
implicit logic of his stance in argumentation would condemn his
enslaving actions. If he is consistent, he would have to quit arguing
and simply behave like a brute, or release the slave. But if the
“master” is a victim who is employing some kind of force in response to
aggression, such as retaliatory force, then in this case there would be
no contradiction involved if the master/victim were to engage in
discourse with his slave/aggressor, since he could point to a
justification for treating the slave/aggressor as a slave. I discuss
this point also in “Defending Argumentation Ethics” (ch. 7).<a

resources, see Hoppe’s and de Jasay’s ideas quoted and discussed in
Kinsella, “Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas,” and note
39, below, and accompanying text. In particular, see Hoppe, <em>A Theory
of Socialism and Capitalism</em>, 24, 160–62, 169-71; and Anthony de
Jasay, <em>Against Politics: On Government, Anarchy, and Order</em>
(London &amp; New York: Routledge, 1997), pp. 158 <em>et seq.</em>, 171
<em>et seq., et pass.</em> (De Jasay is also discussed extensively in
“Review of Anthony de Jasay, <em>Against Politics: On Government,
Anarchy, and Order</em>” (ch. 20). See also “What Libertarianism Is”
(ch. 2), at n.27.) De Jasay’s argument presupposes the value of justice,
efficiency, and order. Given these goals, he argues for three principles
of politics: (1) if in doubt, abstain from political action (pp. 147
<em>et seq.</em>); (2) the feasible is presumed free (pp. 158 <em>et
seq.</em>); and (3) let exclusion stand (pp. 171 <em>et seq.</em>). In
connection with principle (3), “let exclusion stand,” de Jasay offers
insightful comments about the nature of homesteading or appropriation of
unowned goods. De Jasay equates property with its owner’s “excluding”
others from using it, for example by enclosing or fencing in immovable
property (land) or finding or creating (and keeping) movable property
(corporeal, tangible objects). He concludes that since an appropriated
thing has no other owner, <em>prima facie</em> no one is entitled to
object to the first possessor claiming ownership. Thus, the principle
means “let ownership stand,” i.e., that claims to ownership of property
appropriated from the state of nature or acquired ultimately through a
chain of title tracing back to such an appropriation should be
respected. This is consistent with Hoppe’s defense of the “natural”
theory of property. <em>See</em> Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism and
Capitalism</em>, 21–25 and chap. 7. For further discussion of the nature
of appropriation, see Jörg Guido Hülsmann, “The A Priori Foundations of

its value today based on the change from its value yesterday, and so on,
back to the original use of the commodity as money. On the latter, see
Mises, <em>Human Action</em>, chap. 17, § 4. In fact, some of Mises’s
comments suggest this analogy. As he writes: “When we consider the
natural components of goods, apart from the labour components they
contain, and when we follow the legal title back, we must necessarily
arrive at a point where this title originated in the appropriation of
goods accessible to all.” Ludwig von Mises, <em>Socialism: An Economic

Kinsella, “Thoughts on the Latecomer and Homesteading Ideas;”Defending
Argumentation Ethics” (ch. 7); and “How We Come to Own Ourselves”

<p>every person is the proper owner of all nature-given goods that he
has perceived as scarce and put to use by means of his body,
<em>before</em> any other person. Indeed, who else, if not the first
user, should be their owner? The second or third one? Were this so,
however, the first person would not perform his act of original
appropriation, and so the second person would become the first, and so
on and on. That is, no one would ever be permitted to perform an act of
original appropriation and mankind would instantly die out.
Alternatively, the first user together with all late-comers become
part-owners of the goods in question. Then conflict will not be avoided,
however, for what is one to do if the various part-owners have
incompatible ideas about what to do with the goods in question? This
solution would also be uneconomical because it would reduce the
incentive to utilize goods perceived as scarce for the first time.</p>
<p>See also, in this connection, de Jasay, <em>Against Politics</em>,
further discussed and quoted in Kinsella, “Thoughts on the Latecomer and
Homesteading Ideas.” See also de Jasay’s argument (note 34, above) that
since an appropriated thing has no other owner, <em>prima facie</em> no
one is entitled to object to the first possessor claiming ownership. De
Jasay’s “let exclusion stand” idea, along with the Hoppean emphasis on
the prior-later distinction, sheds light on the nature of homesteading
itself. Often the question is asked as to what types of acts constitute
or are sufficient for homesteading (or “embordering” as Hoppe sometimes
refers to it); what type of “labor” must be “mixed with” a thing; and to
what property does the homesteading extend? What “counts” as
“sufficient” homesteading? We can see that the answer to these questions
is related to the issue of what the thing in dispute is. In other words,
if <em>B</em> claims ownership of a thing possessed (or formerly
possessed) by <em>A</em>, then the very framing of the dispute helps to
identify what the thing is that is in dispute and what counts as
possession of it. If <em>B</em> claims ownership of a given resource, he
wants the right to control it, to a certain extent, and according to its
nature. Then the question becomes, did someone else previously control
it (whatever is in dispute), according to its nature; i.e., did someone
else already homestead it, so that <em>B</em> is only a latecomer? This
ties in with de Jasay’s “let exclusion stand” principle, which rests on
the idea that if someone is actually able to control a resource such
that others are excluded, then this exclusion should “stand.” Of course,
the physical nature of a given scarce resource and the way in which
humans use such resources will determine the nature of actions needed to
“control” it and exclude others. See also on this Murray N. Rothbard’s

<li id="fn771"><p> State laws and constitutional provisions often pay
lip service to the existence of various personal and property rights,
but then take it back by recognizing the right of the state to regulate
or infringe the right so long as it is “by law” or “not arbitrary.” See,
e.g., <em>Constitution of Russia</em>, art. 25 (“The home shall be
inviolable. No one shall have the right to get into a house against the
will of those living there, except for the cases established by a
federal law or by court decision”) and art. 34 (“Everyone shall have the
right to freely use his or her abilities and property for
entrepreneurial or any other economic activity not prohibited by the
law”); <em>Constitution of Estonia</em>, art. 31 (“Estonian citizens
shall have the right to engage in commercial activities and to form
profit-making associations and leagues. The law may determine conditions
and procedures for the exercise of this right”); <em>Universal
Declaration of Human Rights</em>, art. 17 (“Everyone has the right to
own property alone as well as in association with others… No one shall
be arbitrarily deprived of his property”); art. 29(2) (“In the exercise
of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such
limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing
due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of
meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general
welfare in a democratic society”). Even the Thirteenth Amendment to the
US Constitution, said to have abolished slavery, makes an exception for
“crimes” (which, of course, the state can arbitrarily decree, such as
drug crimes, tax evasion, evading conscription, etc.): “Neither slavery
nor involuntary servitude, <em>except as a punishment for crime whereof
the party shall have been duly convicted</em>, shall exist within the
United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” (Emphasis

<p>Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Thus the
beneficiaries are spared the shame and danger that their acts would
otherwise involve… But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite
simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and
gives it to the other persons to whom it doesn’t belong. See if the law
benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen
himself cannot do without committing a crime. Then abolish that law
without delay—No legal plunder; this is the principle of justice, peace,
order, stability, harmony and logic.</p>

alone is sufficient to give the state its unique status, and in fact
each power implies the other. The power to tax alone would provide the
agency with the ability to outcompete competing agencies that do not
have this power, in the same way that public (government) schools
outcompete private schools. Thus, the power to tax gives the taxing
agency the practical ability to monopolize the field and outlaw or
restrict competition. And the power to exclude competition alone would
permit the monopolizing agency to charge monopoly prices for its
services, akin to a tax.<a href="#fnref779" class="footnote-back"

is that it has no logical stopping point. If adding (and increasing) IP
protection is a cost worth paying to stimulate additional innovation and
creation over what would occur on a free market—that is, if the amount
of innovation and creation absent IP law is <em>not enough</em>, then
how do we know that we have enough now, under a system of patent and
copyright? Maybe the penalties or terms should be increased: impose
capital punishment, triple the patent and copyright term. And what if
there still is not enough? Why don’t we expropriate taxpayer funds and
set up a government award or prize system, like a huge state-run Nobel
prize with thousands of winners, to hand out to deserving innovators, so
as to incentivize even more innovation? Incredibly, this has been
suggested, too—even by Nobel Prize winners. See Kinsella, “$30 Billion

The idea that you own what you “produce” or “create” is widespread. See,
e.g., Kirzner on Mill:</p>
<p>“The institution of property,” John Stuart Mill remarked, “when
limited to its essential elements, consists in the recognition, in each
person, of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have
produced by their own exertions, or received either by gift or by fair
agreement, without force or fraud, from those who produced it. The
foundation of the whole is the right of producers to what they
themselves have produced.” The purpose of this paper is to point out the
ambiguity of the phrase “what a man has produced”, and to draw
attention, in particular, to one significant, economically valid,
meaning of the term,—a meaning involving the concept of
entrepreneurship—which seems to have been overlooked almost entirely….
Precision in applying the term “what a man has produced” seems to be of
considerable importance.</p>
<p>Israel M. Kirzner, “Producer, Entrepreneur, and the Right to
Property,” <em>Reason Papers</em> No. 1 (Fall 1974;
https://reasonpapers.com/archives/): 1–17, p.1, quoting J.S. Mill,
<em>Principles of Political Economy</em> (Ashley Edition, Londen, 1923),
p. 218. As another example, patent attorney Dale Halling writes: “A
patent is a property right it is not a monopoly. Like all property the
source of the property right is creation.” See comments in Kinsella,

<p>If someone writes or composes an original work or invents something
new, the argument goes, he or she should own it because it would not
have existed without the creator. I submit, however, that as important
as creativity is to human flourishing, it is not the source of ownership
of produced goods… So what is the source? Prior ownership of the inputs
through purchase, gift, or original appropriation. This is sufficient to
establish ownership of the output. Ideas contribute no necessary
additional factor. If I build a model airplane out of wood and glue, I
own it not because of any idea in my head, but because I owned the wood,
the glue, and myself. If Howard Roark’s evil twin trespassed on your
land and, <em>using your materials</em>, built the most creatively
original house ever seen, would he own it? Of course not. <em>You</em>
would—and you’d have every right to tear it down.</p>

<p>Some philosophers account for the right of occupation, by saying,
that every one has a property in his own labour; and when he joins that
labour to any thing, it gives him the property of the whole: But, 1.
There are several kinds of occupation, where we cannot be said to join
our labour to the object we acquire: As when we possess a meadow by
grazing our cattle upon it. 2. This accounts for the matter by means of
accession; which is taking a needless circuit. 3. We cannot be said to
join our labour to any thing but in a figurative sense. Properly
speaking, we only make an alteration on it by our labour. This forms a
relation betwixt us and the object; and thence arises the property,

<p>The masters of science instruct us all—and the supporters of literary
property are the first to argue this—that man does not have the
capability of creating a single atom of matter; that all his activity
consists of appropriating the forces of nature, of channeling these and
modifying their effects, of composing or decomposing substances, of
changing their forms, and, by this steering of the natural forces, by
this transformation of substances, by this separation of elements, of
making nature [<em>la création</em>] more useful, more fertile, more
beneficial, more brilliant, more profitable. So that all human
production consists (1º) of an expression of ideas; (2º) a displacement
of matter.</p>
<p>This is essentially Spooner’s mistake: he has a broad definition of
“wealth,” which includes knowledge, ideas, inventions, etc., and then
assumes that property is just wealth that can be possessed. Thus, ideas
can “be property.” See Spooner, “The Law of Intellectual Property or an
Essay on the Right of Authors and Inventors to a Perpetual Property in
Their Ideas,” §§ 2–3, <em>et pass</em>. This also highlights the
importance of using the term property to refer to the property rights
individuals have with respect to owned resources, as I note in “What
Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2), Appendix I.<a href="#fnref809"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn810"><p> In fact, as Proudhon notes:</p>
<p>[I]n the strict sense of the term, we do not produce our ideas any
more than we produce physical substances. Man does not create his
ideas—he receives them. He does not at all make truth—he discovers it.
He invents neither beauty, nor justice—they reveal themselves to his
soul spontaneously, like the conceptions of metaphysics, in the
perception of the phenomena of the world, in the relations between
things. The intelligible estate [<em>fonds</em>] of nature is, in the
same way as its tangible estate, outside of our domain: neither reason,
nor the substance of things are ours. Even that very ideal which we
dream about, which we pursue, and which causes us to commit so many acts
of folly—this mirage of our understanding and our heart—we are not its
creators, we are simply those who are able to see it.</p>

<li id="fn831"><p> Ayn Rand, “Patents and Copyrights,” in
<em>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</em> (New York: New American Library,
1967), p. 133. The term is now life plus 70 years, thanks to the Sonny
Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, aka the Mickey Mouse
Protection Act
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act).<a
href="#fnref831" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn832"><p> As Rand wrote there:</p>
<p>As an objection to the patent laws, some people cite the fact that
two inventors may work independently for years on the same invention,
but one will beat the other to the patent office by an hour or a day and
will acquire an exclusive monopoly, while the loser’s work will then be
totally wasted. This type of objection is based on the error of equating
the potential with the actual. The fact that a man <em>might</em> have
been first does not alter the fact that he <em>wasn’t</em>. Since the
issue is one of commercial rights, the loser in a case of that kind has
to accept the fact that in seeking to trade with others he must face the
possibility of a competitor winning the race, which is true of all types
of competition.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Rand was incorrect about the US patent law she
thought she was defending. At the time she wrote, under US patent law,
in the case of two inventors who independently invented and filed patent
applications for the same invention, the <em>first to invent</em> (the
first to conceive of the invention) won, <em>not</em> the first to file.
It was not until the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, signed into law by
President Obama in 2011, that the US switched to the first-to-file
standard common in most other countries. See, e.g., “Leahy–Smith America
Invents Act,” <em>Wikipedia</em>
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy%E2%80%93Smith_America_Invents_Act);
and Kinsella, “KOL164 | Obama’s Patent Reform: Improvement or Continuing
Calamity?: Mises Academy (2011),” <em>Kinsella on Liberty Podcast</em>
(Dec. 9, 2014). Rand’s argument defending what she thought was current
US patent law was clearly makeweight; if she had known it was
first-to-invent, she would no doubt have cobbled together some flimsy,
disingenuous argument to justify that. Likewise, the patent term of 17
years is now 20 years from the date of filing, and the copyright term of
life of the author plus 50 years has been extended to life of the author
plus 70 years; there is little doubt she would have found a way to
justify that, too. In other words, according to the
US-Constitution-worshipping Rand, whatever the nearly infallible US
Congress decrees just happens to mirror natural rights. Just so happens.
One may recall the scene near the end of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> (1957)
in which Judge Narragansett had to make only a few amendments to the
Constitution:</p>
<p>He sat at a table, and the light of his lamp fell on the copy of an
ancient document. He had marked and crossed out the contradictions in
its statements that had once been the cause of its destruction. He was
now adding a new clause to its pages: “Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of production and trade….”</p>
<p>Ah, that almost-perfect US Constitution! One can understand Rand’s
enthusiasm for the relative superiority of the US system over the
communist system of the USSR that she fled, but that doesn’t make it
presumptively libertarian in absolute terms. Let’s not be naïve.</p>
<p>As I point out in “Ayn Rand Finally Right about the First-to-File US
Patent System,” <em>C4SIF Blog</em> (Sep. 9, 2011), Rand was also
incorrect in stating “An idea as such cannot be protected until it has
been given a material form. An invention has to be embodied in a
physical model before it can be patented ….” No working model needs to
be made to get a patent. For other mistakes she made about how the
actual IP system works, see Kinsella, “Ayn Rand and <em>Atlas Shrugged,
Part II</em>: Confused on Copyright and Patent,” <em>C4SIF Blog</em>

<p>In the centuries since our founding, the concept of property has
changed dramatically in the United States. One repeatedly mentioned
change is the trend towards treating new things as property, such as job
security and income from social programs. A less frequently discussed
trend is that historically recognized but nonetheless atypical forms of
property, such as intellectual property, are becoming increasingly
important relative to the old paradigms of property, such as farms,
factories, and furnishings. As our attention continues to shift from
tangible to intangible forms of property, we can expect a growing
jurisprudence of intellectual property.</p>

to indicate scarce resources that can be subject to property rights.
(I’ve also sometimes used the term corporeal, a civil-law term.) Hardy
Bouillon argues that it might be more precise to focus on the difference
between material vs. non-material goods, rather than tangible vs.
non-tangible goods, as the touchstone of things subject to property
rights. As Bouillon writes:</p>
<p>Though some speak exclusively of tangible and non-tangible goods, I
prefer to talk of material and immaterial goods…. The point about
material goods is not that they are tangible, for some are not. For
instance, atoms and many other small material units are not tangible;
they are identifiable only indirectly, though this does not prevent us
from calling them material.</p>

Hülsmann &amp; Stephan Kinsella, eds., <em>Property, Freedom and

property rights is whether it is conflictable or not.<a href="#fnref859"

<p>[U]tilitarian arguments of a certain class can cut for or against
intellectual property rights claims. As dealt with in much of the
economics literature, for example, the utility gains from increased
incentives for innovation must be weighed against the utility losses
incurred from monopolization of innovations and their diminished
diffusion. Some have argued that the first part of the comparison may be
either <em>negative</em> or positive; <em>patents or copyrights may
actually decrease innovation, rather than increase it</em>.</p>
<p>As Matt Ridley writes:</p>
<p>A further problem is that patents undoubtedly raise the costs of
goods. That is the point: to keep competition at bay while the innovator
reaps a reward. This slows the development and spread of the innovation.
As the economist Joan Robinson put it: “The justification of the patent
system is that by slowing down the diffusion of technical progress it
ensures that there will be more progress to diffuse.” But this does not
necessarily happen. Indeed, history is replete with examples of bursts
of innovation that follow the ending of a patent.</p>

<li id="fn875"><p> See <em>AIP</em>, the section “IP Rights and Relation
to Tangible Property,” p. 15. Rothbard recognizes this in a limited way
when he writes: “[P]atents actually invade the property rights of those
<em>independent</em> discoverers of an idea or invention who made the
discovery after the patentee. Patents, therefore, <em>invade</em> rather
than defend property rights.” Murray N. Rothbard, <em>Man, Economy, and
State, with Power and Market</em>, Scholar’s ed., 2d ed. (Auburn, Ala.:
Mises Institute, 2009;
https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market),
chap. 10, §7, p. 749. Yet patents invade not only the rights of those
who independently discover the same invention; they also invade the
rights of competitors and copiers who have every right to use publicly
available information to guide their actions and to manipulate their own
resources. And as noted in “Law and Intellectual Property in a Stateless
Society” (ch. 14), Part III.C, and Kinsella, <em>AIP</em>, the section
“Contract vs. Reserved Rights,” Rothbard does not really oppose patents.
He defends what he erroneously calls copyright or “common law
copyright,” with a flawed contract-based argument that contradicts his
own contract theory and his criticism of defamation law (another type of
IP; see Kinsella, “Defamation Law and Reputation Rights as a Type of
Intellectual Property”). But the copyright Rothbard advocates is not
like current, legislated copyright, and it also includes inventions,
like Brown’s mousetrap (which is the domain of patent law). (For
Rothbard’s mousetrap example, see Murray N. Rothbard, “Knowledge, True
and False,” in <em>The Ethics of Liberty</em> (New York: New York
University Press, 1998;
https://mises.org/library/knowledge-true-and-false), p. 123.) So what he
really advocates is a contractual version of patent law (and presumably
copyright law, if his argument extends not only to inventions but also
to artistic works and things like books). And his contract-based
IP/copyright idea is not “common law copyright”; that was doctrine in
the common law that was similar to trade secrets and had nothing to do
with this contractual IP argument Rothbard is making, or to actual
copyright that was not at all rooted in contract. See Wikipedia,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law_copyright. Writes Rothbard:
“Violation of (common law) copyright is an equivalent violation of
contract and theft of property.” Ibid. I criticize this view in
<em>AIP</em>, the section “Contract vs. Reserved Rights.” His reasoning
here also makes some of the same mistakes as his view of “implicit
theft” that I criticize in “A Libertarian Theory of Contract” (ch. 9),

argument, correctly observes:</p>
<p>[O]ne cannot talk significantly of <em>owning
labour</em><sub>1</sub>. For labour<sub>1</sub>, or labouring, is an
activity, and although activities can be engaged in, performed or done,
they cannot be owned.</p>
<p>J.P. Day, “Locke on Property,” <em>Philosophical Quarterly</em> 16
(1966): 207–220, p. 212 (also reprinted in Gordon J. Schochet,
ed. <em>Life, Liberty, And Property: Essays on Locke’s Political
Ideas</em> (Belmont, California: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1971),
p. 113). By “labour<sub>1</sub>,” Day is referring to the activity or
action of working or labouring, as opposed to a task
(labour<sub>2</sub>), an achievement (labour<sub>3</sub>), force times
distance (labour<sub>4</sub>), or workers themselves
(labour<sub>5</sub>) (see the Appendix, p. 220). Day’s comments are
briefly discussed in Kirzner, “Producer, Entrepreneur, and the Right to
Property,” p. 6. See also Kinsella, “Cordato and Kirzner on Intellectual
Property,” <em>C4SIF Blog</em> (April 21, 2011). See also the Hume quote

<p>In Kirzner’s words, Day summarizes Locke’s theory of property
argument thusly: “(1) Every man has a (moral) right to own his person;
therefore (2) every man has a (moral) right to own the labor of his
person; therefore (3) every man has a (moral) right to own that which he
has mixed the labor of his person with.” Kirzner, <em>op. cit.</em>,

<p>As Hoppe explains, Carl Menger pointed out four requirements for
objects to become goods:</p>
<p>The first is the existence of a human need. The second requirement is
such properties as render the thing capable of being brought into a
causal connection with a satisfaction of this need. That is, this object
must be capable, through our performing certain manipulations with it,
to cause certain needs to be satisfied or at least relieved. The third
condition is that there must be human knowledge about this connection,
which explains, of course, why it is important for people to learn to
distinguish between <em>goods</em> and <em>bads</em>. Thus, we have
human knowledge about the object, our ability to control it, and the
causal power of this object to lead to certain types of satisfactory
results. And the fourth factor is, as I already indicated, that we must
have command of the thing sufficient to direct it to the satisfaction of
the need.</p>

right is not a <em>right to use</em> a resource, but a <em>right to
exclude others</em> from using a resource. In practical terms this gives
the owner the ability to use it as he sees fit so long as he is not
using trespassing on others’ property rights. This follows from the
analysis in Kinsella, “The Non-Aggression Principle as a Limit on
Action, Not on Property Rights,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 22,
2010) and <em>idem</em>, “IP and Aggression as Limits on Property
Rights: How They Differ,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 22, 2010).

known as “logorights.” Oddly, perhaps partially in response to my
relentless criticism of his flawed argument, he eventually changed his
argument to argue for “media-carried property,” thus implicitly
acknowledging that he was in favor of property rights in
characteristics, or features, of owned objects, i.e., universals. See
“Introduction to Origitent” (ch. 16) and “Conversation with Schulman

this. As she wrote:</p>
<p>The power to rearrange the combinations of natural elements is the
only creative power man possesses. It is an enormous and glorious
power—and it is the only meaning of the concept “creative.” “Creation”
does not (and metaphysically cannot) mean the power to bring something
into existence out of nothing. “Creation” means the power to bring into
existence an arrangement (or combination or integration) of natural
elements that had not existed before.</p>

<li id="fn903"><p> Likewise, many libertarians, having in mind some form
of “strict liability,” advance the confused idea that we are responsible
for harms done with property (resources) that we own. This is incorrect.
We are responsible only for our actions, not for uses to which inanimate
objects are put. If I possess a stolen knife, I am liable if I stab an
innocent person with it, even though I don’t own the knife, since it is
my <em>actions</em> that I am responsible for. And if some thief steals
a knife and uses it to harm an innocent victim, it is the thief that is
responsible, not the owner of the knife. One common confusion held even
by many libertarians is the idea (which underlies many assertions about
“strict liability”) that ownership implies responsibility (some have
even confusingly said that you “own your actions,” which is incoherent).
It does not. Ownership means the <em>right to control</em> (or, more
precisely: the right to exclude others from controlling) a given
resource; it does <em>not</em> imply responsibility. We are responsible
only for our actions, regardless of whatever means are employed by the
actor to achieve the illicit end. It is misleading and confusing for
libertarians to carelessly use expressions such as “I own that action”
to mean “I am responsible for harm I cause.” The term ownership should
be restricted to property rights in conflictable resources—and should be
used as a synonym for possession, either, as I point out in “Selling
Does Not Imply Ownership, and Vice-Versa: A Dissection” (ch. 11), the
sections “External Resources” and “Economic vs. Normative Realms of
Analysis: Ownership vs. Possession.”</p>

Mackaay unpersuasively argues that something resembling patent and
copyright can emerge through private legal arrangement like trade secret
and contractual structures, a “simulated property right,” which the
legislator can then “complement” by “by adding the possibility of
systematically ensuring exclusivity against third parties.” Mackaay,
“Economic Incentives in Markets for Information and Innovation,” p. 904;
see also p. 899–901 <em>et pass.</em> Or, as summarized by Dale Nance,
Mackaay sees IP rights:</p>
<p>… as representing a compromise that appears relatively warranted
because they do not have the kind of features associated with the worst
kinds of governmental meddling in the economy, and because their
functional equivalents could, to a considerable extent but perhaps at
greater cost, be achieved by carefully protected trade secrets combined
with contractually imposed restrictions on copying by buyers or
licensees of the information in question. In other words, he sees
patents and copyrights as little more troublesome than state-provided
form contracts.</p>

Pol’y</em> 13, no. 3 (Summer 1990): 757–74, p. 770. Easterbrook makes a
similar, and similarly untenable, claim, when he writes: “[I]n the end
intellectual property may be understood as the result of voluntary
undertakings, which the government simply enforces.” Frank H.
Easterbrook, “IntellectualProperty Is Still Property,” <em>Harv. J. L.
&amp; Pub. Pol’y</em> 13, no. 1 (Winter 1990;

p. 114.</p>
<p>And many other proponents of IP argue for parallels between IP rights
and normal property rights. See, e.g., “Conversation with Schulman about
Logorights and Media-Carried Property” (ch. 17).</p>
<p>Yet elsewhere, Epstein concedes there are some significant
differences between IP and real property. As he writes, “There are in
fact no ‘natural’ boundaries here [in patent and copyright law], similar
to the metes and bounds of land.” Richard A. Epstein, “Why Libertarians
Shouldn’t Be (Too) Skeptical about Intellectual Property,” Progress

<p>This was a very deliberate choice on the part of politicians working
for the adoption of a patent law in the French Constitutional Assembly.
De Bouffler, reporting the bill to the Assembly, knew that “the spirit
of the time was so much for liberty and equality, and against privileges
and monopolies of any sort” that there was no hope of saving the
institution of patent privileges except under an acceptable theory.
Thus, according to Rentzsch, De Bouffler and his friends in deliberate
insincerity “construed the artificial theory of the property rights of
the inventor” as a part of the rights of man. De Bouffler obviously knew
“what’s in a name.” As monopoly privileges, the patents for inventions
would be rejected by the Assembly or, if accepted, would be disdained by
the people; as natural property rights, they would be accepted and
respected.<a href="#fnref907" class="footnote-back"

System</em> (85th Cong., 2nd Session, 1958, Study No. 15;

(footnotes omitted). As explained in Machlup &amp; Penrose, “The Patent
Controversy in the Nineteenth Century,” and as summarized in Machlup,
<em>An Economic Review of the Patent System</em>, free market economists
began to object to the patent system in the mid-1800s, leading some
countries to repeal or delay adopting patent laws. The primary criticism
was that protectionist patent grants are incompatible with free trade.
However, the “Long Depression” starting in 1873 turned public opinion
against free trade, leading the anti-patent movement to collapse and for
modern patent systems to eventually become dominant world-wide. See
also, on this, Meiners &amp; Staaf, “Patents, Copyrights, and

Hayek wrote:</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not a waste of your time if I illustrate what I have in
mind by quoting a rather well-known decision in which an American judge
argued that “as to the suggestion that competitors were excluded from
the use of the patent we answer that such exclusion may be said to have
been the very essence of the right conferred by the patent” and adds “as
it is the privilege of any owner of property to use it or not to use it
without any question of motive.” It is this last statement which seems
to me to be significant for <em>the way in which a mechanical extension
of the property concept by lawyers has done so much to create
undesirable and harmful privilege.</em></p>

While ‘creative property’ is certainly ‘property’ in a nerdy and precise
sense that lawyers are trained to understand, it has never been the
case, nor should it be, that ‘creative property owners’ have been
‘accorded the same rights and protection resident in all other property
owners.’ Indeed, if creative property owners were given the same rights
as all other property owners, that would effect a radical, and radically
undesirable, change in our tradition.<a href="#fnref914"

<p>Despite the attractions of a Lockean approach and its apparent
amenability to intellectual property, I side with Jefferson. I will
challenge the claim that Lockean foundations straightforwardly support
most strong natural rights over intellectual works—such things as
articles, plays, books, songs, paintings, methods, processes, and other
inventions. I will also challenge the related claim that Lockean
foundations for strong property rights come easier for these forms of
intellectual property than for real property. As Jefferson observed and
as I hope to explain, the nature of intellectual works makes them less,
rather than more, susceptible to Lockean justifications for private
appropriation.<a href="#fnref920" class="footnote-back"

the concerns animating <em>The New Property</em>. His worst fears have
not been realized: The country is not approaching the point at which
“most private ownership is supplanted by government largess.” [Reich, op
cit., p. 771] Yet the steady erosion of independent property rights has

largesse.</p>

p. 46–47:</p>
<p>In the actuality of the everyday world, human beings are able to
satisfy their wants only through directing their efforts toward
appropriate <em>means</em> for such satisfaction. A man who wishes to
eat may purchase food, cook food, or simply put on a hat and coat and go
to a restaurant. His actions have been intermediary to the goal of
eating. “Eating” is the <em>end</em> of his present endeavors; the
<em>means</em> that he adopts for the attainment of his end can be an
act of purchase, cooking, or walking to the restaurant.</p>
<p>In a sense, the actual end of action is <em>always</em> the
attainment of some new state of affairs, some want-satisfaction, and
never the acquisition or ownership of a corporeal good since, as
Böhm-Bawerk has observed, such goods are valued <em>only because of the
renditions of service they provide</em>. See Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk,

<li id="fn974"><p> This is explicit in Rothbard. He writes:</p>
<p>The <em>means</em> to satisfy man’s wants are called <em>goods</em>.
These goods are all the objects of economizing action. Such goods may
all be classified in either of two categories: <em>(a)</em> they are
immediately and <em>directly serviceable</em> in the satisfaction of the
actor’s wants, or <em>(b)</em> they may be transformable into directly
serviceable goods only at some point in the future—i.e., are
<em>indirectly serviceable</em> means. The former are called
<em>consumption goods</em> or <em>consumers’ goods</em> or <em>goods of
the first order</em>. The latter are called <em>producers’ goods</em> or
<em>factors of production</em> or <em>goods of higher order</em>.</p>
<p>Murray N. Rothbard, <em>Man, Economy, and State, with Power and
Market</em>, Scholars ed., 2d ed. (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, 2009;
https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market),
chap. 1, § 3 (citations omitted). This equivalence between means and
goods is also implicit in Mises’s writings, as well. See, e.g., Mises,
<em>Human Action</em>, chap. IV, § 1, p. 93:</p>
<p>Economic goods which in themselves are fitted to satisfy human wants
directly and whose serviceableness does not depend on the cooperation of
other economic goods, are called consumers' goods or goods of the first
order. Means which can satisfy wants only indirectly when complemented
by cooperation of other goods are called producers’ goods or factors of
production or goods of a remoter or higher order.<a href="#fnref974"

p. 18. Note here the focus on the possibility of <em>conflict</em> and
its connection to the concept of scarcity and the need for property
rights. Thus, as noted elsewhere in this volume, in recent years I
(Kinsella) sometimes use terms like rivalrous or “conflictable,” instead
of, or as an augment to, the concept of “scarce,” to avoid equivocation
from IP socialists. See “<em>Against Intellectual Property</em> After
Twenty Years” (ch. 15), n.29 <em>et pass.</em>; Kinsella, “On
Conflictability and Conflictable Resources,”

<p>This “ownership” of one’s own body implies one’s right to invite
(agree to) another person’s doing something with (to) one’s own body: my
right to do with my body whatever I want, that is, includes the right to
ask and let someone else use my body, love it, examine it, inject
medicines or drugs into it, change its physical appearance and even
beat, damage, or kill it, if that should be what I like and agree to.

referred to as “goods” and others can be referred to as “bads.”
<em>Goods</em> would obviously be those means that are suitable in order
to satisfy some needs that we have, and <em>bads</em> would be objects
that we can control, but that would have negative repercussions on us,
that would not satisfy any needs but, to the contrary, may harm us or
even kill us.</p>

wealth either through homesteading, production and contractual exchange,

contractual exchangers. There are no other ways.” Hans-Hermann Hoppe,

Reconstruction of the Present Economic Order,” in <em>The Economics and

Intellectual Property in a Stateless Society” (ch. 14), text at n.82.
But production presupposes the producer already owns the property that
he transforms into something more desirable or useful. The only ways to
<em>acquire</em> a particular scarce resource is to either homestead it,
acquire it contractually, or steal it. (One may also transform
already-owned property into the desired configuration.)<a

they each own a <em>different</em> 50 percent. It is as logically

<p>… looking into the distinction between private and public goods more
thoroughly, we discover that the distinction turns out to be completely
illusory. A clear-cut dichotomy between private and public goods does
not exist, and this is essentially why there can be so many
disagreements on how to classify a given good. All goods are more or
less private or public and can—and constantly do—change with respect to
their degree of privateness/publicness as people’s values and
evaluations change, and as changes occur in the composition of the
population. In order to recognize that they never fall, once and for
all, into either one or the other category, one must only recall what
makes something a good. For something to be a good it must be recognized
and treated as scarce by someone. Something is not a good as such, that
is to say; goods are goods only in the eyes of the beholder. Nothing is
a good unless at least one person subjectively evaluates it as such.<a

<p>[T]hat the central authorities in a totalitarian economy lack any

corollary of the fact that central authorities always lack a sufficient
knowledge of the infinite number of elements and factors that contribute

level.</p>

law-creation. See also note 63, below, and accompanying text, concerning

and scientistic attempt to give this kind of economic theorizing a
patina of scientific respectability by borrowing engineering
terminology. It is scientistic because, in vainly trying to borrow
natural sciences terminology, there is an assumption that only the
“hard” or natural sciences have true validity. It is akin to using such
inapt phrases as the “momentum” of the leading team in a basketball
game, the “energy” of crystals and astral forms, or, even worse,
“revving the engine” of the economy. Both economics and ethics can be
sciences, but not in the same way as the causal, natural sciences. On

are <em>past</em> prices, which are always the <em>outcome</em> of
action, not its cause. Hülsmann explains that “all information that this
action was based upon had to be acquired beforehand. The price itself
could not have communicated the knowledge that brought it [the price]
about.” Hülsmann, “Knowledge, Judgment, Property,” p. 26. With regard to
the tin example, “tin does not become scarcer and <em>then</em> this

Calculation Debate Revisited,” in <em>Economic Controversies</em>
(Auburn, Ala: Mises Institute, 2011;
https://mises.org/library/economic-controversies). As Mises notes:
“Appraisement is the anticipation of an expected fact. It aims at
establishing what prices <em>will be paid</em> on the market for a
particular commodity or what amount of money will be required for the
purchase of a definite commodity” (emphasis added). Ludwig von Mises,
<em>Human Action: A Treatise on Economics</em>, Scholar’s ed. (Auburn,
Ala.: Mises Institute, 1998; https://mises.org/library/human-action-0),
p. 329. “The essential elements of economic calculation are speculative
anticipations of future conditions,” and the entrepreneur calculates
based on “an understanding of future conditions, necessarily always
colored by the entrepreneur’s opinion about the future state of the
market.” Ibid., p. 349.<a href="#fnref1041" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn1042"><p> See Hülsmann, “Knowledge, Judgment, Property,”
p. 44, discussing the secondary importance of any possible information
communicated through prices. But as Mises points out, in an intriguing
and neglected passage, future prices are not only not dependent on past
prices, but in principle could be forecasted by entrepreneurs even
before there are existing money prices. As Mises writes:</p>
<p>If the memory of all prices of the past were to fade away, the
pricing process would become more troublesome, but not impossible as far
as the mutual exchange ratios between various commodities are concerned.
It would be harder for the entrepreneurs to adjust production to the
demand of the public, but it could be done nonetheless. It would be
necessary for them to assemble anew all the data they need as the basis
of their operations. They would not avoid mistakes which they now evade
on account of experience at their disposal. Price fluctuations would be
more violent at the beginning, factors of production would be wasted,
want-satisfaction would be impaired. But finally, having paid dearly,
people would again have acquired the experience needed for a smooth
working of the market process.</p>
<p>Mises, <em>Human Action</em>, chap. XVI. Some people, who are
anti-bitcoin, etc., are alarmed by this comment by Mises, since it
undercuts their view of the nature and function of money and prices, but
I think it gets to the heart of the matter: that all action is aimed at
changing the future, which is uncertain; and it is <em>future</em>
(uncertain) prices which are used in economiccalculation. See Kinsella,
“Human Action and Universe Creation,” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (June
28, 2022). “Current”—or, immediate past—prices cannot determine future
prices, but they can serve as a starting point, an “accessory of
appraisement,” since it can be easier to take stock of the current price
array and envision the change, the delta, between now and the future,
based on one’s forecast of how human interactions will change, than to
forecast a future price starting from chaos. But in principle, there is
no reason an actor in a barter society could not forecast the emergence
of money in the near future and try to predict the prices that would
emerge thereafter. This <em>Gedankenexperiment</em> helps to highlight
that prices do not convey knowledge or information, but rather reflect
the knowledge, preferences, forecasts, and judgments of actors.<a

to decide whether or not to purchase an airline ticket to fly to France.
<em>Structure</em>, p. 55. But this example ignores the role of prices
in entrepreneurial appraisal in favor of its economically less essential
role in consumer choices. See Ludwig von Mises, <em>Economic Calculation
in the Socialist Commonwealth</em> (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, 1990
[1920]; https://mises.org/library/economic-<br />

“consumers goods are not the real problem…. The real problem … is in all
the intermediate markets for land and capital.” Rothbard, “The End of

“the crucial decisions in the capitalist economy are the allocation of
capital to firms and industries.” Ibid., pp. 58–60. See also Mises,
<em>Human Action</em>, p. 325: “The driving force of the market process
is provided neither by the consumers nor by the owners of the means of
production … but by the promoting and speculating entrepreneurs.” See

Horwitz also notes that current “prices … do serve as the starting point

“<em>because they do provide (imperfect) information about scarcity,
wants, and opportunity costs</em>.” Horwitz, “Monetary Calculation and
Mises’s Critique of Planning,” p. 441. The latter part of the sentence
seems to be superfluous and not logically connected to the first.
Current prices are the starting point in appraisement because today’s
prices will change in various ways to result in future prices, which are
of interest to entrepreneurs. For a discussion of the connection of
current prices to previous prices, see Mises’s regression theorem

can be seen in his statement that “there is no <em>problem</em> of
scarcity in the absence of an incompatibility of subjective
preferences.” Ibid., p. 38. But this gets it backwards. We cannot even
meaningfully say that preferences “conflict” <em>unless</em> they are
manifested in conflicting <em>actions</em> regarding the use of
particular scarce resources. Thus the concepts of scarcity and conflict
are more fundamental than the notion of conflicting preferences or
knowledge. On the theory of demonstrated preference, see Rothbard,

consistent with this emphasis on scarcity and action (p. 77). “[R]ights
are construed as enforceable claims to acquire, use, and transfer
resources in the world-claims to control one’s person and external
resources.” Such rights are thus <em>operational</em> and can serve to

<p>… the law of obligations is one area of the vast region of the law of

<p>The <em>theory</em> of obligations appears as a peculiar intellectual
phenomenon in the evolution of legal thought. No doubt, it belongs
together with the <em>law</em> of obligations but the theory does not
reach as far as the law itself. The theory of obligations concerns
itself only with an analysis of the component parts, the blueprint, of a
certain mechanism, but without exploring the ways in which that
mechanism works in concrete situations. Thus, the theory of obligations
concerns itself with contract as the general scheme of all sorts of
accords of the will of parties, without looking into the variations to
which that scheme is susceptible according to the different needs it
must satisfy. The theory leaves these variations to be explored
elsewhere, in the sphere of special contracts, or contracts in
particular, such as sale, lease, loan, and the many others that exist.<a

The Louisiana Criminal Code defines assault as “an attempt to commit
battery, or the intentional placing of another in reasonable
apprehension of receiving battery.” A battery is defined as “the
intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another; or the
intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or
substance to another.” Louisiana Criminal Code § 33. Assault can thus
also include an attempted battery (which need not put the victim in a
state of apprehension of receiving a battery—e.g., the victim may be
asleep and be unaware that another has just swung a club at his head,
but missed.<a href="#fnref1099" class="footnote-back"

<p>The title of this book [<em>The Virtue of Selfishness</em>] may evoke
the kind of question that I hear once in a while: “Why do you use the
word ‘selfishness’ to denote virtuous qualities of character, when that
word antagonizes so many people to whom it does not mean the things that
you mean?” To those who ask it, my answer is: “For the reason that makes
you afraid of it.”</p>

grants that the use of the term “several” in the first edition was a
mistake:</p>
<p>Were I writing the book today, however, I might change one term. I
might use the term “private property” rather than the term “several
property” that I borrowed from Hayek, who himself borrowed it from
Scottish Enlightenment thinkers. I preferred “several property” because
it emphasized the need to recognize jurisdiction over resources among
the several or many individuals and associations that comprise a
society. Were property held in the private hands of a very few, this
type of “private property” would not address the problems of knowledge
and interest. But in the interest of clarity and the avoidance of
jargon, “private property” would have been clearer and, I now think,
preferable.</p>

out, the existence of the state itself is evidence that anarchy is
possible, for officials of the state “voluntarily” abide by certain
hierarchies and rules, e.g., the American president is physically less
powerful than his armies, yet they tend to obey him rather than
vice-versa. Alfred G. Cuzán, “Do We Ever Really Get Out of Anarchy?,”

inherently contradictory since it fails its own test, as it is not
itself falsifiable. Mises, for example, writes:</p>
<p>The essence of logical positivism is to deny the cognitive value of a
priori knowledge by pointing out that all a priori propositions are
merely analytic. They do not provide new information, but are merely
verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the
definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic
propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz.,
that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions
is in itself a—as the present writer thinks, false—synthetic a priori
proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience.</p>

Socialism may be defined as a system of “institutionalized interference

claims.” Hans-Hermann Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism:
Economics, Politics, and Ethics</em> (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute,

adopts a plan to exterminate all Hungarians at a rate of ten per day,
but, for some reason, is bungling the job and is only executing one
Hungarian per day. No sane person would admonish the government to speed
up its executions or even to investigate the cause of the government’s
“inefficiency” in this regard. For a similar point, see Bruce L. Benson,
“Third Thoughts on Contracting Out,” <em>J. Libertarian Stud.</em> 11,
no. 1 (Fall 1994;
https://mises.org/library/third-thoughts-contracting-out): 44–78, which
argues that privatization of governmental services should not always be
favored, even by libertarians; for example, when the privatized service,
such as the IRS, is unjust and increasing its efficiency would simply
increase injustice. See also Randy E. Barnett, “The Relevance of the
Framers’ Intent,” <em>Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y</em> 19 (1995–96;
http://www.randybarnett.com/pre-2000): 403–410, p. 410 (arguing that one
reason we should interpret the Constitution in accordance with the
Framers’ original intentions is “because we today share their intentions
to limit the power of government in a way that enhances and protects the
liberty of the people.”).<a href="#fnref1178" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn1179"><p> By individual rights, I mean the specifically
<em>libertarian</em> conception of individual rights, in which the only
fundamental right is to be free from aggression, where “‘[a]ggression’
is defined as the <em>initiation</em> of the use or threat of physical
violence against the person or property of anyone else.” Murray N.
Rothbard, <em>For A New Liberty</em>, 2d ed. (Auburn, Ala.: Mises
Institute, 2006;
https://mises.org/library/new-liberty-libertarian-manifesto), 27. (See
also “What Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2).) The phrase “individual rights”
is preferable to the phrase “human rights,” since the latter expression,
like the term “liberal” in American usage, has acquired a leftist or
socialist tinge. <em>See, e.g.</em>, the United Nation’s <em>Universal
Declaration of Human Rights</em>, U.N. GAOR, 217A (III) (1948), at
articles 22–26 (reciting, for example, “human rights” to “social
security” and to “free” “education”). Libertarian individual rights are
roughly equivalent to the set of natural rights under older terminology.
For libertarian justifications for the existence of individual rights,

chap. 7); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, <em>The Economics and Ethics of Private

<li id="fn1180"><p> Reasons for the populace’s acquiescence might
include: a sympathy with socialism over the years on the part of
intellectuals and large portions of society; the corruption wrought by
democracy itself, which breeds special interest wars and the willingness
to use government to get one’s piece of the pie before one is made
victim by others; the welfare/warfare state, which provides recipients
of redistributed tax dollars (in the form of welfare payments or
government salaries) with an incentive to support ever-growing
government; and public education, which inevitably results in the state
propagandizing each generation of students in favor of its programs.

is largely sound, although Bork himself occasionally misapplies his own
theory, for example, with respect to the Ninth Amendment. <em>See</em>
Robert H. Bork, <em>The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of
the Law</em> (New York: Free Press, 1990), pp. 143–45, 183–85. Original
understanding should not be confused with original intent. The “original
intent” of the Framers is relevant only insofar as it is evidence for
the public’s “original understanding” of the Constitution, the so-called
“original public meaning,” as agreed to by the people or their
representatives. See also Louisiana Civil Code
(https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=111052), art. 9:</p>
<p>When a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead

<li id="fn1182"><p> Regarding the presumption of governmental
legitimacy, Professor Barnett makes the interesting and promising
argument that the necessary assumption that citizens have a moral
obligation to obey positive law presumes that there be some mechanism to
ensure that such laws are legitimate. See Randy E. Barnett, “Foreword:
The Ninth Amendment and Constitutional Legitimacy,” <em>Chicago-Kent L.
Rev.</em> 64 (1988): 37–65, reprinted in Randy E. Barnett, ed., <em>The
Rights Retained by the People</em>, vol. 2 (Fairfax, Va.: George Mason
University Press, 1993), p. 391. Under our system of government, this
requires Ninth Amendment-based judicial review of legislation to provide
a sort of “quality control” to ensure the promulgated laws do not
infringe the citizens’ enumerated or unenumerated rights. See ibid.; see

discusses the symbiotic relationship between the Ninth and Tenth
Amendments:</p>
<p>The Tenth Amendment … was intended to complement the power limiting
aspect of the Ninth Amendment. If the Ninth Amendment was intended in
part to prevent the accretion of federal power implied by virtue of the
existence of enumerated rights exempt from the reach of federal power,
the Tenth Amendment was designed to prevent the accretion of federal
power by implication from any other source in the Constitution…. Both
Amendments were intended to preserve to the people of the states the
sovereign’s prerogative to confer powers upon their state governmental
agents (recognized in the Tenth Amendment) and to maintain all manner of
individual rights secure from governmental invasion (recognized in the
Ninth Amendment). An intended medium for doing so, in both cases, was
the state constitution.</p>

chosen over another by examining the competing rights’ “constitutional

<p>Massey’s claim that the Ninth Amendment secures state-created rights
as affirmative limitations on federal power had not been advanced by a

presents an incoherent amalgamation of diametrically opposed readings of
the text and history of the Ninth Amendment.</p>

Ninth Amendment,” in Barnett, ed., <em>The Rights Retained by the
People</em>, vol. 1, at 1, 33; see also note 7, above (discussing Randy
Barnett’s “constitutional legitimacy” argument for judicial enforcement
of unenumerated Ninth Amendment rights). There is another argument in
favor of protecting rights unenumerated by the Ninth Amendment. The
Constitution was ratified in 1789 only on the understanding that a bill
of rights would be added. However, since the Bill of Rights was not
completed and adopted until 1791, at the time of ratification, the
rights that were to be added by a bill of rights were unspecified. Since
these rights were unspecified, but the Constitution was initially
conceived as being limited by whatever these rights were, merely
enumerating some of these rights at a later time in the Bill of Rights
does not necessarily exhaust all the background rights that <em>could
have been</em> enumerated in the Bill of Rights (i.e., there is no
guarantee that the Bill of Rights captured all the enumerated rights on
which the Constitution’s ratification was dependent). Thus, for the
ratification to be effective and for the Constitution to have validity,
the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights cannot be seen as an
exhaustive list. For a complementary argument, see Randy E. Barnett,
“Reconceiving the Ninth Amendment,” <em>Cornell L. Rev.</em> 74, no. 1
(1988; www.randybarnett.com/pre-2000): 1–42, p. 29 (“Only a handful of
the many rights proposed by state ratification conventions were
eventually incorporated in the Bill of Rights. The Ninth Amendment was
offered precisely to ‘compensate’ these critics for the absence of an
extended list of rights.”).<a href="#fnref1310" class="footnote-back"

Argumentation ethics is discussed in “Dialogical Arguments for
Libertarian Rights” (ch. 6) and “Defending Argumentation Ethics”
(ch. 7).<a href="#fnref1335" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn1336"><p> Hoppe’s article, “The Ultimate Justification of the
Private Property Ethic,” <em>Liberty</em> 2, no. 1 (Sept. 1988;
https://perma.cc/6TYM-BJRZ): 20–22 (included as chap. 13 of
<em>EEPP</em>), was the subject of the symposium, “Breakthrough or
Buncombe,” <em>Liberty</em> 2, no. 2 (Nov. 1988;
https://perma.cc/A5UU-P64A): 44–53, containing discussion of Hoppe’s
argumentation ethics by several libertarian theorists, many critical,
and Hoppe’s reply, “Utilitarians and Randians <em>vs</em> Reason”
(53–54). This reply is included in “Appendix: Four Critical Replies” in
<em>EEPP</em>; see also subsequent response to critics in <em>idem</em>,
“PFP163 | Hans Hermann Hoppe, ‘On The Ethics of Argumentation’ (PFS
2016),” <em>The Property and Freedom Podcast</em>, ep. 163 (June 30,
2022).</p>
<p>In addition to the response to the <em>Liberty</em> symposium,
“Appendix: Four Critical Replies” also includes responses to David
Osterfeld, Loren Lomasky, and David Conway in other publications. See
David Osterfeld, “Comment on Hoppe,” <em>Austrian Economics
Newsletter</em> 9, no. 3 (Spring/Summer 1988;
https://perma.cc/4229-ZR7P): 9–10 (also including Hoppe’s reply,
“Demonstrated Preference and Private Property: Reply to Professor
Osterfeld,” pp. 10–12, and Sheldon Richman, “Comment on Osterfeld,”
p. 10). David Conway’s review of Hoppe, <em>A Theory of Socialism and
Capitalism</em> (pp. 11–14) and Hoppe’s response, “On the
Indefensibility of Welfare Rights: A Comment on Conway” (pp. 14–16),
appeared in <em>Austrian Economics Newsletter</em> 11, no. 1
(Winter/Spring 1990; https://perma.cc/X2PR-H8BW). Loren Lomasky’s
criticism was “The Argument from Mere Argument,” <em>Liberty</em> 3, no.
1 (Sept. 1989; https://perma.cc/38XS-ZDEL): 55–57. Hoppe’s reply to
Lomasky was “Intimidation by Argument—Once Again,” <em>Liberty</em> 3,
no. 2 (Nov. 1989; https://perma.cc/4382-RKSQ): 37–39, republished as
“Intimidation by Argument,” section III in “Appendix: Four Critical
Replies.” Rothbard’s humorous response to Lomasky was “Hoppephobia,”
originally published in <em>Liberty</em> 3, no. 4 (March 1990;
https://perma.cc/JT7K-YTUJ): 11–12, reprinted at
<em>LewRockwell.com</em> (Oct. 4, 2014; https://perma.cc/5HH6-2P78. See

<p>Regarding Yeager—in my view, he is wrong about several topics. First,
he is wrong about Hoppe’s argumentation ethics; see also “Defending
Argumentation Ethics” (ch. 7), n.5. Also, he is wrong about
self-ownership; see “How We Come to Own Ourselves” (ch. 4), n.1. And he
is wrong about knowledge and the calculation problem. On this latter
issue, see “Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society”

<li id="fn1348"><p> Rothbard has developed a useful classification or
typology of aggressive intervention. If an aggressor’s command or order
involves only the commanded individual himself—i.e., the aggressor
restricts the individual’s use of his own property, when exchange with
someone else is not involved—this Rothbard calls <em>autistic
intervention</em>. If the aggressor compels an <em>exchange</em> between
the individual and himself, or coerces a “gift” from the individual
subject, this may be called a <em>binary intervention</em>, since a
hegemonic relation is established between two people: the aggressor and
the individual subject. If the aggressor compels or prohibits an
exchange between a <em>pair</em> of subjects, this is called
<em>triangular intervention</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of autistic intervention are murder or compulsory
prohibition or enforcement of a salute or speech. Taxation,
conscription, slavery, and compulsory jury service are examples of
binary intervention. Examples of triangular intervention are price
controls, minimum wage laws, and licensing. Murray N. Rothbard, <em>Man,
Economy, and State, with Power and Market</em>, Scholars ed., 2d
ed. (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, 2009;
https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market),
chap. 12, §2. In chapter 3, “Banking, Nation States and International
Politics: A Sociological Reconstruction of the Present Economic Order,”
Hoppe makes similar distinctions among aggressive actions in pointing
out why states with relatively more liberal internal economic policies
are more successful in war against states with relatively less internal
liberalization:</p>
<p>The need for a productive economy that a warring state must have also
explains why it is that ceteris paribus those states which have adjusted
their internal redistributive policies so as to decrease the importance
of economic regulations relative to that of taxation tend to outstrip
their competitors in the arena of international politics. Regulations
through which states either compel or prohibit certain exchanges between
two or more private persons as well as taxation imply a non-productive
and/or non-contractual income expropriation and thus both damage
homesteaders, producers or contractors i.e., those that cause wealth to
come into existence. However, while by no means less destructive of
productive output than taxation, regulations have the peculiar
characteristic of requiring the state’s control over economic resources
in order to become enforceable without simultaneously increasing the
resources at its disposal. In practice, this is to say that they require
the state’s command over taxes, yet they produce no monetary income for
the state (instead, they satisfy pure power lust, as when <em>A</em>,
for no material gain of his own, prohibits <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>
from engaging in mutually beneficial trade). On the other hand, taxation
and a redistribution of tax revenue according to the principle “from
Peter to Paul,” increases the economic means at the government’s
disposal at least by its own “handling charge” for the act of
redistribution. Since a policy of taxation, and taxation without
regulation, yields a higher monetary return to the state (and with this
more resources expendable on the war effort!) than a policy of
regulation, and regulation with taxation, states must move in the
direction of a comparatively deregulated economy and a comparatively
pure tax-state in order to avoid international defeat…. A highly
characteristic example of this connection between a policy of internal
deregulation and increased external aggressiveness is provided by the
Reagan administration.</p>

Ayn Rand’s thought related to this subject is worth noting:</p>
<p>[A]s Rand maintains, all “oughts” are hypothetical, based on valuing
one’s life….</p>
<p>The point is not that one has to be alive in order to act to achieve
anything. The point is that being pro-life is what makes end states
qualify as <em>values</em>. Only choosing to hold one’s life as a value
gives one the stake in one’s actions that is required for the whole
issue of evaluation to arise….</p>
<p>Contrary to biological determinism, one does not <em>have</em> to
pursue any goals or proclaim anything to be of value. But contrary to
subjectivism, if one does, the action or proclamation logically depends
on implicitly accepting one’s life as one’s ultimate value….</p>
<p>The issue of <em>justifying</em> choices arises only in the context
of having already chosen to live. The choice to live is not extra-moral,
but pre-moral; it is a precondition of all moral evaluation.</p>
<p>Harry Binswanger, “Life-Based Teleology and the Foundations of
Ethics,” <em>The Monist</em> 75, no. 1 (Jan. 1992): 84–103, at 99–100.
As Ayn Rand states:</p>
<p>Life or death is man’s only fundamental alternative. To live is his
basic act of choice. If he chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell
him what principles of action are required to implement his choice. If
he does not choose to live, nature will take its course.</p>

poorly reasoned and largely unconvincing. See David Kelley, <em>The
Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of Perception</em> (1986),
p. 27–31 (discussing the primacy of existence); Leonard Peikoff,
<em>Objectivism: The Philosopy of Ayn Rand</em> (New York: Dutton,
1991), pp. 148–52 (discussing Ayn Rand and philosophy of objectivity).
The notorious phrase of Kant’s can be found in English in Immanuel Kant,
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (Norman K. Smith trans. 1953 [1929]),
pp. 21–22. As David Kelley, executive director of the Institute for
Objectivist Studies, paraphrases Kant:</p>
<p>Hitherto it has been supposed,” Kant says in his major work, “that
all our knowledge must conform to the objects,” but, he argues, … under
that supposition, every effort to establish the validity of
consciousness has failed. So, “the experiment therefore ought to be
made, whether we should not succeed better with the problems of
metaphysics by assuming that the objects must conform to our mode of
cognition.</p>
<p>Kelley perceptively criticizes Kant here with an analogy, that of
Kant’s thought applied to the driving of a car:</p>
<p>Hitherto it has been supposed that our steering must conform to the
road. But on this supposition it has proved impossible to establish the
validity of our steering. The experiment therefore ought to be made,
whether we should not have more success with the problem of driving by
assuming that the road must conform to our steering.</p>
<p>David Kelley, “The Primacy of Existence,” <em>The Foundations of
Knowledge</em>, Lecture 1 (The Jefferson School Conference, San Diego;
YouTube, 1985; https://youtu.be/AVBgfamJxFk).</p>
<p>Author’s note (2023): As Hoppe has observed, Kant’s meaning is
ambiguous or murky enough because of his wording to cause some, such as
Kelley, and other, primarily American, philosophers, to interpret Kant
in this idealistic way, while others, primarily on the continent, have
interpreted him in a more realistic way. See <em>EEPP</em>, p. 282 and
282 n.17, citing, as examples of the latter, Friedrich Kambartel,
<em>Erfahrung and Struktur</em> (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1968), chap. 3
as well as Hoppe’s own <em>Handeln und Erkennen: Zur Kritik des
Empirismus am Beispiel der Philosophie David Humes</em> (Bern: Lang,
1976; www.hanshoppe.com/german). Some other books suggested to me in
this regard, which I have not yet read (and I don’t know German),
include: Ralph C.S. Walker, <em>Kant</em> (London: Routledge and Kegan
Paul, 1978) (suggested by Barry Smith); Paul Abela, <em>Kant’s Empirical
Realism</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2002) and J.N. Findlay, <em>Kant
and the Transcendental Object: A Hermeneutic Study</em> (Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1981) (suggested by David Gordon); Paul Lorenzen,
<em>Methodisches Denken</em> (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1968) and
<em>idem</em>, <em>Normative Logic and Ethics</em> (Mannheim:
Bibliographisches Institut, 1969) (suggested by Hoppe); Magdalena Aebi,
<em>Kants Begründung der “Deutschen Philosophie”: Kants Transzendentale
Logik, Kritik Ihrer Begründung</em> (Basel: Verlag für Recht und
Gesellschaft, 1947) (suggested by Kevin Mulligan).</p>
<p>But as Hoppe points out, “Whether or not such an interpretation of
Kant’s epistemology is indeed correct is a very different matter.
Clarifying this problem is of no concern here, however.” <em>EEPP</em>,
p. 282 n.17. In any case, Kantians such as Mises, Kantian-Misesians such
as Hoppe, and Aristotelean-Misesians such as Rothbard are in fact
epistemological realists and not idealists as some philosophers construe
Kant to be. To the contrary, the Misesian praxeological perspective
helps to ground a realist epistemology. As Hoppe notes,</p>
<p>Recognizing knowledge as being structurally constrained by its role
in the framework of action categories provides the solution to such a
complaint, for as soon as this is realized, all idealistic suggestions
of rationalist philosophy disappear, and an epistemology claiming that a
priori true propositions exist becomes a realistic epistemology instead.
Understood as constrained by action categories, the seemingly
unbridgeable gulf between the mental on the one hand and the real,
outside physical world on the other is bridged.</p>

epistemology, see his <em>Economic Science and the Austrian Method</em>,

of physics at the University of Connecticut, claims that evidence shows
that the phenomenon of stellar aberration is not due to the relative
velocity of a star with respect to Earth, as is claimed by Einstein’s
theory of relativity. Ibid., at 91–92. The evidence thus casts doubt on
the validity of Einsteinian relativity. <em>Galilean

synonymously with “the state,” although it is probably preferable to use
the term state, when possible, as it is conceptually distinct from
“government,” as one can imagine “governing institutions” of law and
order in a private-law society. In fact many statists and mini-statists
(minarchists) often engage in equivocation on this point; they
presuppose that there cannot be law and order, or “government,” without
the state, but if the anarchist claims to favor law and order, then the
statist equates government with state and accuses the anarchist of being
inconsistent. This is really simply disingenuous question-begging hidden
behind an equivocation.<a href="#fnref1400" class="footnote-back"

Lysander Spooner, writing in 1870. Note especially Spooner’s point
2:</p>
<p>The ostensible supporters of the Constitution … are made up of three
classes, viz.: 1. Knaves, a numerous and active class, who see in the
government an instrument which they can use for their own aggrandizement
or wealth. 2. Dupes—a large class, no doubt—each of whom, because he is
allowed one voice out of millions in deciding what he may do with his
own person and his own property, and because he is permitted to have the
same voice in robbing, enslaving, and murdering others, that others have
in robbing, enslaving, and murdering himself, is stupid enough to
imagine that he is a “free man,” a “sovereign”; that this is a “free
government”; “a government of equal rights,” “the best government on
earth,” and such like absurdities. 3. A class who have some appreciation
of the evils of government, but either do not see how to get rid of
them, or do not choose to so far sacrifice their private interests as to
give themselves seriously and earnestly to the work of making a
change.</p>

Authority,” in <em>The Lysander Spooner Reader</em> (San Francisco,
Calif.: Fox and Wilkes, 1992; http://www.lysanderspooner.org/works).
Spooner (1808–1887), an anarchist, was a Massachusetts lawyer noted for
his vigorous opposition to the encroachment of the state upon the
liberty of the individual, such as the institution of slavery. In <em>No
Treason</em>, Spooner demolishes the “consent” theory of the validity of
the Constitution. Unfortunately, Spooner was a total crank and wrong on
the important issue of intellectual property. See “Law and Intellectual

taxation and all tax codes and all mechanisms by which a privileged
elite attempts to extract wealth from the population. And this is always
the first step in any tax reform: get the public seething about the tax
code, and do it by way of preparation for step two, which is the
proposed replacement system. Of course, this is the stage at which you

in “<em>Against Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years” (ch. 15),
n.78. As I note in “What Libertarianism Is” (ch. 2), I employ the term
intellectual property or IP even though it is loaded, because these
terms are so commonly employed one must adopt them in order to
communicate about these topics with others. See also “<em>Against
Intellectual Property</em> After Twenty Years” (ch. 15), Part IV.I.
Böhm-Bawerk makes a similar point about the necessity of continuing to
use some inaccurate terms in economics. As he writes:</p>
<p>[I]f we undertake a theoretical examination of the sources of our
well-being, we cannot but recognize the truly useful element when it is
present, even in this area, in personal and material renditions of
service, nor can we do aught but recognize that, from the economic
viewpoint, such “goods” as family, church, love and the like are merely
<em>linguistic disguises</em> for a totality of concretely useful
renditions of service….</p>
<p>No matter how clearly I may have proved that payment-claims and
good-will relationships are not genuine goods, no matter how clearly I
have therefore proved that, whenever, in practical economic life rights
and relationships are bought and sold, it is not, in truth, those
intangibles that are meant and are valued and transferred, but that
actually it is material goods and renditions of service that are so
dealt in; no matter, I say, how clear my proof, I am not going to
pretend to believe that economic practice will submit to any slavish
accuracy in the matter. It will in the future continue to be the custom,
and rightly so, to say that <em>A</em>’s wealth consists in
payment-claims, that <em>B</em> sold his good will for $50,000 to C, and
that the state, the church and the family are valuable “goods.” Yes, I
believe even <em>economic theory</em> will, quite properly, continue
talking that same language because it is the language that all the world
talks and understands. For it would be an absurd undertaking to banish
from the language of <em>economic theory</em> every manner of speaking
that is not literally correct; it would be sheer pedantry to proscribe
every figure of speech, particularly since we could not say the
hundredth part of what we have to say, if we refused ever to take
recourse to a metaphor.</p>
<p><em>One requirement is essential, that economic theory avoid the
error of confusing a practical habit, indulged in for the sake of
expediency, with scientific truth.</em></p>

<li id="fn1503"><p> Most libertarian or free-market oriented IP critics,
or others who pose as critics of IP, are not actually IP abolitionists;
they simply want to reform or tame the “excesses” of the system, e.g.,
Tom Bell, Jerry Brito, Alexander Tabarrok, Michael Masnick, Cory
Doctorow, Larry Lessig, Mark Cuban (who has sponsored a chair at the EFF
to fight “stupid patents”; see https://perma.cc/3K8N-8RMG), even
leftists like Eben Moglen and Richard Stallman etc. who pose as
opponents of corporate IP. But none of them want to abolish patent and
copyright. They just want to reform it, and/or replace it with some
other statist system, like taxpayer funded innovation awards or prizes.
E.g., Tom Bell wants to return to the “Founder’s Copyright.” I mean,
better than nothing, but thin gruel. As for the others, see Kinsella,
“Tom Bell on copyright reform; the Hayekian knowledge problem and
copyright terms,” <em>C4SIF Blog</em> (Jan. 6, 2013). Tabarrok supports
reducing the patent term, but not to zero, and also supports a tax
funded innovation prize. Kinsella, “Tabarrok’s <em>Launching the
Innovation Renaissance</em>: Statism, not renaissance,”
<em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Dec. 2, 2011). Lessig thinks “some
punishment” of Aaron Swartz—the brilliant young co-creator of RSS, who
committed suicide when facing decades in federal prison on copyright
charges for uploading academic articles to the Internet—was justified.
See Kinsella, “Tim Lee and Lawrence Lessig: ‘some punishment’ of Swartz
was ‘appropriate,’” <em>StephanKinsella.com</em> (Jan. 13, 2013),

<blockquote>
<p>“Thank goodness the Swiss did have a Patent Office. That is where
Albert Einstein worked and during his time as a patent examiner came up
with his theory of relativity.”</p>
<p>“It is true that other means exist for creative people to profit from
their effort. In the case of copyright, authors can charge fees for
reading their works to paying audiences. Charles Dickens did this, but
his heavy schedule of public performances in the United States, where
his works were not protected by copyright, arguably contributed to his
untimely death.”</p>
<p>If you are not for IP, you must be in favor of pedophilia.</p>
<p>If you oppose IP, you are advocating slavery.</p>
<p>“Patents are the heart and core of property rights.”</p>
<p>Song piracy and file-sharing are the cause of stage collapses at
concerts.</p>
<p>“To make a distinction between things which are ownable or not
ownable with the difference being whether they’re constructed out of
molecules or pixels is to create a new kind of apartheid, in which some
kinds of property are just [n-words].”</p>
<p>If IP isn’t legitimate, then it’s okay to steal other people’s
babies.</p>
<p>Without IP you can’t have money</p>

<p>One cannot call the history of intellectual property a purely
proletarian struggle. While ancient Roman laws afforded a form of
copyright protection to authors, the rise of Anglo-Saxon copyright was a
saga of publishing interests attempting to protect a concentrated market
and a central government attempting to apply a subtle form of censorship
to the new technology of the printing press.</p>
<p>Regarding Roman law protecting a form of copyright, Hughes cites
UNESCO, <em>The ABC of Copyright</em> (1981;
https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000187677), p. 12. Yet this
reference does not support the contention that copyright law was
recognized, only that plagiarism was seen as dishonorable. Plagiarism
has nothing to do with copyright law. See references in “Libertarianism

indicated by Thadeusz, a new study by economic historian Eckhard Hoffner
argues that the main reason that Germany’s production and industry had
caught up with everyone else by 1900 is the absence of copyright law.

<p>Regarding the proliferation of books presenting or re-stating
libertarian thought in the last couple decades, recall this comment by
scholar A.H.J. Greenidge, in his “Historical Introduction” to Gaius’s
<em>Institutes of Roman Law</em>: “The Institutes of Gaius are a product
of this activity; for <em>it is necessary that a great deal of detailed
and special work shall be done in a science before a good handbook on
the subject can be written for the use of students</em>.” A.H.J.
Greenidge, “Historical Introduction,” in Gaius, <em>Institutes of Roman
Law</em>, with a translation and commentary by Edward Poste,
4<sup>th</sup> ed., revised and enlarged by E.A. Whittuck (Oxford: 1904;
https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gaius-institutes-of-roman-law), p. li
(§ 20; emphasis added). This important work by Gaius was mostly lost
until found in nearlycomplete form in a palimpsest in Verona in 1816.
(See Wikipedia entry, “<em>Institutes</em> (Gaius),”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_(Gaius)). The “activity”
referred to by Greenidge above is described in the preceding section
thusly:</p>
<p>The literary activity in the domain of law, during the period which
intervened between the accession of Augustus and the time of Gaius, was
of the most varied character. Religious law (Jus Pontificlum) attracted
the attention of Capito. Labeo wrote on the Twelve Tables. The Praetor’s
Edict was the subject of studies by Labeo, Masurius Sabinus, Pedius and
Pomponius. The Edict of the Curule Aediles was commented on by Caelius
Sabinus. Salvius Julianus, besides his redaction of the Edicts, produced
a work known as Digesta, which perhaps assumed the form of detailed
explanations of points of law systematically arranged. Comprehensive
works on the Civil Law were furnished by Masurius Sabinus and Caius
Cassius Longinus. Other jurists produced monographs on special branches
of law, as the younger Nerva on Usucapion, Pedms on Stipulations,
Pomponius on Fideicommissa. Some lawyers wrote commentaries on the works
of their predecessors. It was thus that Aristo dealt with Labeo, and
Pomponins with Sabinus. Other works took the form of Epistolae, which
furnished opinions on special cases which had been submitted to their
author, and collections of Problems (Quaestiones). Nor was history
neglected. There must have been much of it in Labeo’s commentary on the
Twelve Tables; and Pomponius wrote a Handbook (Enehiridion), which
contained a sketch of the legal history of Rome from the earliest
times.</p>

<li id="fn1556"><p> Writes Hoppe:</p>
<p>Let me begin with the definition of a state. What must an agent be
able to do to qualify as a state? This agent must be able to insist that
all conflicts among the inhabitants of a given territory be brought to
him for ultimate decision-making or be subject to his final review. In
particular, this agent must be able to insist that all conflicts
involving <em>himself</em> be adjudicated by him or his agent. And
implied in the power to exclude all others from acting as ultimate
judge, as the second defining characteristic of a state, is the agent’s
power to tax: to unilaterally determine the price that justice seekers
must pay for his services.</p>
<p>Based on this definition of a state, it is easy to understand why a
desire to control a state might exist. For whoever is a monopolist of
final arbitration within a given territory can <em>make</em> laws. And
he who can <em>legislate</em> can also <em>tax</em>. Surely, this is an
enviable position.</p>
<p>Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “Reflections on the Origin and the Stability of
the State,” <em>LewRockwell.com</em> (June 23, 2008;

Kinsella, “The Nature of the State and Why Libertarians Hate It,”

Come to Own Ourselves” (ch. 4). But admittedly, it is difficult to avoid
using these terms, as I have indicated elsewhere in this book. Though it
might be better to refer to the state instead of government; to an owned
resource in which someone has a property right, rather than to calling
the resource “property”; to aggression instead of coercion, it is
sometimes more convenient to use more conventional or colloquial terms
to avoid tedium. I don’t even like referring to patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret as “intellectual property” rights, but if one is
to communicate with normies, sometimes one has to accept conventional
terminology, even if it is loaded or ambiguous.<a href="#fnref1560"
