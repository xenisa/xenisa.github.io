<blockquote>
<p>[…] value is objective (not intrinsic or subjective); value is based
on and derives from the facts of reality (it does not derive from mystic
authority or from whim, personal or social). Reality, we hold — along
with the decision to remain in it, i.e., to stay alive — dictates and
demands an entire code of values. Unlike the lower species, man does not
pursue the proper values automatically; he must discover and choose
them; but this does not imply subjectivism. Every proper value-judgment
is the identification of a fact: a given object or action advances man’s
life (it is good): or it threatens man’s life (it is bad or an evil).
The good, therefore, is a species of the true; it is a form of
recognizing reality. The evil is a species of the false; it is a form of
contradicting reality. Or: values are a type of facts; they are facts
considered in relation to the choice to live.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Existentially, an action of man […] is good or bad according to its
effects: its effects, positive or negative, on man’s life. Thus creating
a skyscraper is good, murdering the architect is bad — both by the
standard of life. But human action is not merely physical motion; it is
a product of a man’s ideas and value-judgments, true or false, which
themselves derive from a certain kind of mental cause; ultimately, from
thought or from evasion. […] The skyscraper’s creator […] functioned on
the basis of proper value-judgments and true ideas, including a complex
specialized knowledge; so he must have expended mental effort, focus,
work; so one praises him morally and admires him. But the murderer […]
acted on ideas and value-judgments that defy reality; so he must have
evaded and practiced whim-worship; so one condemns him morally and
despises him.</p>

<h1 id="against-the-separation-of-ethics-and-law">Against the Separation
of Ethics and Law</h1>
<p>In the preparation for and the writing of this course I have
encountered a strange tendency wherein the claim that “people ought not
violate the rights of others” is apparently a controversial one even
among Austrians. This is indicative of a severe problem in
Austro-Libertarian circles that deserves a dedicated section of the
course to properly address. The root of the problem is that many reject
the core defnition of law as a subset of ethics, claiming instead that
there is such a thing as a virtuous crime. The paragon example would be
a man who is about to commit suicide by jumping off of a cliff, and the
only way to save this man is to violate his rights by grabbing him and
dragging him away from the cliffs edge. These contextualist-libertarians
would have it that whether a crime is immoral or not depends on
extra-legal context.</p>
<p>I believe much of the confusion on this topic stems from the fact
that many libertarians (at least appear to be) somewhat inconsistent, at
some points indicating that law is indeed a subset of ethics and at
other points rejecting this position. Rothbard explicitly states in his
work on pollution that “law is a subset of
ethics,”<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
and “a set of ‘ought’ or normative propositions,” but his discussion of
“lifeboat scenarios” in <em>The Ethics of Liberty</em> is commonly cited
to negate this point. Rothbard presents the conundrum as
follows:<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is often contended that the existence of extreme, or “lifeboat,”
situations disproves any theory of absolute property rights, or indeed
of any absolute rights of self-ownership whatsoever. It is claimed that
since any theory of individual rights seems to break down or works
unsatisfactorily in such fortunately rare situations, therefore there
can be no concept of inviolable rights at all. In a typical lifeboat
situation, there are, let us say, eight places in a lifeboat putting out
from a sinking ship, and there are more than eight people wishing to be
saved. Who then is to decide who should be saved and who should die?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On its face, this appears to not present any serious problem to the
theory presented in this course—the fact that the truth of the matter is
unsatisfactory or makes someone upset or look like a bad guy for
presenting it does not constitute a refutation of said truth. Indeed, to
warp ones ethics to suit ones intuitions such that any “unsatisfactory”
results are purged would be to surrender oneself to accepting the mystic
power of whim to grant truth, thus tainting an otherwise sound
epistemology.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>
Thus I shall proceed with the analysis without caring about how
nasty-sounding the conclusion reached may be. In the first place we have
a scarcity, only 8 spots in the lifeboat and more than 8 people, thus
property rights must be assigned. Presumably this lifeboat did not
materialise in nature and was instead built by or purchased by whomever
owns the boat, thus it is he who has the right to say who gets a spot.
Perhaps he makes a rule that women and children go first, perhaps he
decides that crewmates get priority over customers, and so on. Whatever
arbitrary rules he sets ought be abided.</p>
<p>Now what of the situation where the owner set no rules forth and has
died abandoning the lifeboat into the domain of nature? We surely
already have our solution in the homesteading principle—first come first
served. If you get to a spot in the lifeboat you are thus using said
spot and thus get to dictate how it is to be used (presumably you would
want it to be used to save yourself). This might be horribly unfair to
those who are slower or started further away from the lifeboat, but
tough luck! Life isn’t fair and neither is law—the prime goal of law is
justice not fairness. What, after all, would be the alternative? That
people who are slower to get to the boat (i.e. latecomers) are the ones
who should get a spot? Well then the people they kick out could just
immediately return to the boat as an even later-comer, thus entering us
into an endless dance of groups getting in and out of the boat—everyone
would be equal but everyone would be dead. It seems that Rothbard came
to the same conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the owner of the boat or his representative (e. g. the captain of
the ship) has died in the wreck, and if he has not laid down known rules
in advance of the wreck for allocation of seats in such a crisis, then
the lifeboat may be considered–at least temporarily for the
emergency–abandoned and therefore unowned. At this point, our rules for
unowned property come into play: namely, that unowned resources become
the property of the first people possessing them. In short, the first
eight people to reach the boat are, in our theory, the proper “owners”
and users of the boat. Anyone who throws them out of the boat then
commits an act of aggression in violating the property right of the
“homesteader” he throws out of the boat. After he returns to shore,
then, the aggressor becomes liable for prosecution for his act of
violation of property right (as well, perhaps, for murder of the person
he ejected from the boat).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rothbard continues with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first place, a lifeboat situation is hardly a valid test of a
theory of rights, or of any moral theory whatsoever. Problems of a moral
theory in such an extreme situation do not invalidate a theory for
normal situations. In any sphere of moral theory, we are trying to frame
an ethic for man, based on his nature and the nature of the world-and
this precisely means for normal nature, for the way life usually is, and
not for rare and abnormal situations. It is a wise maxim of the law, for
precisely this reason, that “hard cases make bad law.” We are trying to
frame an ethic for the way men generally live in the world; we are not,
after all, interested in framing an ethic that focuses on situations
that are rare, extreme, and not generally encountered.</p>
<p>Let us take an example, to illustrate our point, outside the sphere
of property rights or rights in general, and within the sphere of
ordinary ethical values. Most people would concede the principle that
“it is ethical for a parent to save his child from drowning.” But, then,
our lifeboat skeptic could arise and hurl this challenge: “Aha, but
suppose that two of your children are drowning and you can save only
one. Which child would you choose? And doesn’t the fact that you would
have to let one child die negate the very moral principle that you
should save your drowning child?” I doubt whether many ethicists would
throw over the moral desirability or principle of saving one’s child
because it could not be fully applied in such a “lifeboat” situation.
Yet why should the lifeboat case be different in the sphere of
rights?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The response here indicates that there are at least two
<em>different</em> spheres of ethics, one for normal situations and one
for abnormal ones. It is not clear, however, how on Earth it could be
possible to make a non-arbitrary distinction between “normal” and
“abnormal” ethical conundrums. Moreover, if such a principled
distinction cannot be made between normal and abnormal such a theory
would be particularistic and thus irrational. That is to say, there are
certainly many differences one could use to define normal as opposed to
abnormal; say that situations where red shirts are worn are abnormal and
where red shirts are not worn the situation is normal. That would be a
difference, but the difference is not relevant to ethical theory—thus a
rational norm must apply to both classes of situations in order to be
universal as opposed to particular. Until such a principled difference
can be found to define normal as opposed to abnormal we are stuck with
universal norms having to apply to both classes and thus there are not
two “spheres” of moral theory. That is to say; it couldn’t be the case
that property rights hold “normally” but not “abnormally,” as such would
be a particularistic property norm, and thus an irrational one.</p>
<p>I must now consider Rothbards drowning children hypothetical, in the
case of the single child it is assumed that the parent can save them,
and in the case of two children it is assumed that only one can be
saved. There are indeed certain similarities between the drowning
children and the lifeboat—for the case of two children one will die and
one will live, for the lifeboat 8 will live and others will die. The
question is how to determine who should live and who should die. We have
our solution in the case of the lifeboat, and it strikes me that this
course provides a similar ability to answer the drowning children
example. The mother cannot physically save both, thus it is surely a
matter of personal preference which one she saves, and why should she be
expected to act any differently? It would be logically impossible for
her to pick the one she would prefer not to save, and thus the only
alternative would be to let both drown. Surely we can easily sum this up
in a universal principle—guardians ought save their children from
drowning insofar as they have the ability to. It is not my claim that
this principle has been proven, after all this is a law course not a
course on ethics in general, but I cannot see how this would not be
universal and it certainly seems that it easily deals with Rothbards
hypothetical opponent.</p>
<p>Rothbard seemingly goes forth with his multi-sphere model (emphasis
added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may well be objected to our theory as follows: that a theory of
property rights or even of self-ownership is derivable from the
conditions by which man survives and flourishes in this world, and that
therefore in this kind of extreme situation, where a man is faced with
the choice of either saving himself or violating the property rights of
the lifeboat owner (or, in the above example, of the “homesteader” in
the boat), it is then ridiculous to expect him to surrender his life on
behalf of the abstract principle of property rights. Because of this
kind of consideration, many libertarians who otherwise believe in
property rights gravely weaken them on behalf of the “contextualist”
contention that, given a choice between his life and aggressing against
someone else’s property or even life, it is moral for him to commit the
aggression and that therefore in such a situation, these property rights
cease to exist. <strong>The error here on the part of the
“contextualist” libertarians is to confuse the question of the moral
course of action for the person in such a tragic situation with the
totally separate question of whether or not his seizing of lifeboat or
plank space by force constitutes an invasion of someone else’s property
right.</strong> For we are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and
property, i.e., a “political” ethic, concerned with all personal moral
principles. We are not herewith concerned whether it is moral or immoral
for someone to lie, to be a good person, to develop his faculties, or be
kind or mean to his neighbors. We are concerned, in this sort of
discussion, solely with such “political ethical” questions as the proper
role of violence, the sphere of rights, or the definitions of
criminality and aggression. Whether or not it is moral or immoral for
“Smith”–the fellow excluded by the owner from the plank or the
lifeboat–to force someone else out of the lifeboat, or whether he should
die heroically instead, is not our concern, and not the proper concern
of a theory of political ethics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a first glance, it would seem that Rothbard is adopting a
dichotomy between law and ethics, and this very passage has been cited
to me numerous times to that effect. But to my eye that is only one of
multiple valid interpretations of Rothbards writing here—it appears to
me that he is merely hedging his bets in ignoring the questions of
ethics as a whole and focusing in on the area that he has expertise in.
This highlights why Rothbard saw fit to analogise the lifeboat scenario
to “ordinary ethical values;” if law was not a subset of ethics, i.e. if
it did not deal with “ought” statements such an analogy would be
incoherent. Furthermore, Rothbard is correct that “we are not, in
constructing a theory of liberty and property […] concerned with
<strong>all</strong> personal moral principles,” we are rather only
concerned with those moral principles that pertain to conflicts over
scarce means. This does not, as the critics claim, demonstrate that law
and ethics are disconnected fields. Clearly, if we are concerned with a
subset of all moral principles which deals specifically with conflicts
in doing law then law itself is a subset of morality in general. This
analysis is also consistent with Rothbards claim that “[w]hether or not
it is moral or immoral for ‘Smith’–the fellow excluded by the owner from
the plank or the lifeboat–to force someone else out of the lifeboat, or
whether he should die heroically instead, is not our concern, and not
the proper concern of a theory of political ethics.” It very much
appears to me that Rothbard is merely leaving the floor open for his
legal theory to be compatible with any outside ethical theory that one
may come up with—even one that would allow for contradictions between
“personal” and “political” ethics. Of course, such a theory would be
false, but that is not the concern of Rothbard qua legal theorist. This
becomes clear in a footnote attached to the end of the above paragraph,
commenting on an example where two men are floating in the water and
there is a plank that can save only one of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eric Mack’s example fails to show a necessary conflict between
property rights and moral principles. The conflict in his example is
between property rights and the dictates of prudence or self-interest.
But the latter is only dominant in morality if one adopts moral egoism,
which indeed Professor Mack does, but which is only one possible moral
theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes it abundantly clear to me that Rothbard is, as I claim,
simply trying to make his ethic as narrow as possible such that it may
be slotted into any general ethical theory. Rothbard continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The crucial point is that <em>even</em> if the contextualist
libertarian may say that, given the tragic context, Smith
<em>should</em> throw someone else out of the lifeboat to save his own
life, he is <em>still</em> committing, at the very least, invasion of
property rights, and probably also murder of the person thrown out. So
that even if one says that he should try to save his life by forcibly
grabbing a seat in the lifeboat, he is still, in our view, liable to
prosecution as a criminal invader of property right, and perhaps as a
murderer as well. After he is convicted, it would be the <em>right</em>
of the lifeboat owner or the heir of the person tossed out to forgive
Smith, to pardon him because of the unusual circumstances; but it would
also be their right <em>not</em> to pardon and to proceed with the full
force of their legal right to punish. Once again, we are concerned in
this theory with the rights of the case, <em>not</em> with whether or
not a person chooses voluntarily to exercise his rights. In our view,
the property owner or the heir of the killed would have a right to
prosecute and to exact proper punishment upon the aggressor. The fallacy
of the contextualists is to confuse considerations of individual,
personal morality (what should Smith do?) with the question of the
rights of the case. The right of property continues, then, to be
absolute, even in the tragic lifeboat situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Rothbards use of the <em>even if</em> disclaimer prior to the
hypothetical proof that Smith should throw someone out of the lifeboat
is a crystal-clear signal that Rothbard is merely entertaining this
<em>as</em> a hypothetical counter to his thesis. What Rothbard has done
is that he has shown his theory of property rights to hold <em>even
if</em> someone were to prove that there are separate “personal” and
“political” spheres of ethics. To re-iterate; Rothbard has not here
<em>accepted</em> that there is indeed such a proof, all he has done is
shown that the existence of such a proof is <em>irrelevant</em> to his
legal theory.</p>
<p>Of course, such a proof does not exist, as said multi-sphere ethics
would be a polylogism. Ought is ought, there is not ought-but-personal
and a separate ought-but-political. There is only ought. Confusion on
this matter comes due to colloquial usage of the word “ought” in
sentences like, “you ought wear a coat because you don’t want to get
wet.” There are two ways we can interpret this statement, either we
assume that “ought” is being used in the precise logical meaning, or we
assume it is being used as prudential advice. In the former case, the
statement is simply invalid, it does not follow from the fact that a
person doesn’t want to get wet that they ought prevent themselves from
getting wet by wearing a coat. After all, I may want to rape a baby but
it does not follow from the existence of this whim that I actually ought
obey it. The latter interpretation of “ought” being prudential advice is
a colloquial usage of the word—what is really being said is “if you want
to not get wet wearing a coat will achieve this goal,” which is clearly
an “is” statement, all that is being said is that the given strategy
will attain the goal, not whether the goal is proper. Thus it could not
be that “politically” you ought not aggress but “personally” you ought
aggress, as that would be a contradiction—you ought aggress and you
ought not aggress. Then it appears clear that Rothbard holds law as a
subset of ethics but has also successfully shielded his theory from any
attack which would seek to separate them.</p>
<p>This stance becomes confusing in the light of modern Austrian
theorists, Hoppe has shown with his argumentation ethics that any
attempt at negating the NAP leads to contradiction, but elsewhere claims
that he was not attempting to derive an “ought” from an
“is.”<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
But surely if an ought statement which negates the NAP falls into
contradiction its negation must be true? This will be analysed in
greater depth below, but for now the contextualist counter-thesis to my
position is summed up explicitly by Konrad
Graf:<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Placing deductive legal theory within praxeology enables its
reconstruction as a categorical and definitional assessment of what
types of actions are NAP infringements—separate from moral assessment of
such infringements. In this view, an example of an ethical statement
would be, “One should not violate rights.” Legal theory helps to make
this goal actionable by supplying information concerning the question:
“What is ‘violating rights?’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what then does it mean to violate a right? As I’m sure Konrad
would
agree<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>
it means that you could not justify your conduct, but what does it mean
that you cannot justify your conduct? It means you cannot claim that
your conduct <strong>should</strong> go forth as said claim implies a
contradiction, thus its negation that your conduct <strong>should
not</strong> go forth is true. This is a legal claim
<strong>and</strong> an ethical one—in fact, <em>every</em> legal claim
is also an ethical claim, as every legal claim is a claim about which
party <strong>should</strong> have possession in the conflict at
hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There <em>is</em> an intuitive relationship between law and ethics.
However, I argue that it is not one of a field to a sub-field, but
rather an <em>advisory</em> relationship between two distinct fields.
[…] If one takes on the moral objective of not aggressing, one is more
likely to be <em>successful</em> at this in action with a clear idea of
what aggression is. “Rights infringements” become one category of wrongs
next to other non-legal categories of wrongs that a given ethical system
may specify. Yet the definition of <em>what constitutes</em> infringing
rights is derived independently of ethics using the categorical,
counterfactual method of praxeology. Although [Argumentation Ethics]
establishes that no propositional argument against the NAP can succeed,
it does not prevent human beings from infringing the NAP
<em>anyway</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Konrad is correct that argumentation ethics does not prevent
people from engaging in aggression, but it does demonstrate that any
attempted justification of that aggression would fall into
contradiction—that is to say any claim that one <em>ought</em> aggress
implies a contradiction and thus its negation that one <em>ought
not</em> aggress is <em>true</em>. Just as the fact that 1+1 makes 2
does not prevent people from acting erroneously on the thought that it
actually makes 3, so too does the fact that aggression is evil not
prevent people from erroneously acting on the thought that it is good.
Furthermore, Konrad himself states that “the NAP forms the outer
boundary of justifiability for any norm or
rule,”<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>
this is because any norm in contradiction to the NAP is simply
incoherent via the nature of justification as such. Law is pointless if
it is not a subset of ethics—<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>
is a crime, but so what? What does it mean to have a right if it doesn’t
mean that it should not be violated? Could one accept wholesale the NAP
and the entire Rothbardian politics whilst agreeing with every ethical
prescription we hear from the Marxists? If ethics and law merely
intersect, where do they intersect, and why not elsewhere? What are
those rights that should be violated and in what sense are they even
rights if they shouldn’t be respected?</p>
<p>A favourite quote of the ethics and law separators comes from Hoppe
himself, who
states:<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of
offering a completely value-free justification of private property. It
remains entirely in the realm of is-statements and never tries to derive
an “ought” from an “is.” The structure of the argument is this: (a)
justification is propositional justification—a priori true is-statement;
(b) argumentation presupposes property in one’s body and the
homesteading principle—a priori true is-statement; and (c) then, no
deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified—a priori true
is-statement. The proof also offers a key to an understanding of the
nature of the fact-value dichotomy: Ought-statements cannot be derived
from is-statements. They belong to different logical realms. It is also
clear, however, that one cannot even state that there are facts and
values if no propositional exchanges exist, and that this practice of
propositional exchanges in turn presupposes the acceptance of the
private property ethic as valid. In other words, cognition and
truth-seeking as such have a normative foundation, and the normative
foundation on which cognition and truth rest is the recognition of
private property rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoppe is indeed correct that his above syllogism is not of the form
“<em>is statement</em>, <em>is statement</em>, therefore <em>ought
statement</em>,” but those in the Konrad-camp are incorrect to conclude
from this that argumentation ethics fails to demonstrate the truth and
falsehood of different ought statements. As Hoppe himself stated in that
very passage recognition of the private property ethic (aka the NAP) as
valid is a pre-condition for arguing over anything—thus, to try and
dispute the NAP you have to first accept that it is true giving it
axiomatic status just as surely as the action axiom or the law of
non-contradiction. Furthermore we can use the conclusion of Hoppes above
syllogism to construct a new syllogism:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I ought engage in aggression <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em> → <em>p</em> ∧ ¬<em>p</em></span> (a
priori true is-statement);</li>
<li><span class="math inline">¬(<em>p</em> ∧ ¬<em>p</em>)</span> (a
priori true is-statement);</li>
<li><span class="math inline">∴</span> I ought <em>not</em> engage in
aggression <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> (a priori true
ought-statement).</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, <span
class="math inline">¬NAP → <em>p</em> ∧ ¬<em>p</em> ∴ ¬(¬NAP) = NAP</span>,
but how could this be if facts and values “belong to different logical
realms?”</p>
<h1 id="dismantling-humes-guillotine">Dismantling Hume’s Guillotine</h1>
<p>The issue we come to with this view is a dogmatic application of
Hume’s Guillotine, also called the fact-value dichotomy—the claim is
that its impossible to derive an <em>ought</em> from an <em>is</em>. But
clearly I have done just that; the negation of the NAP is an ought
statement that implies a contradiction, contradictions are false,
therefore the NAP is true—it is a <em>true</em> ought statement. However
you want to describe this, whether I have “sidestepped” or “transcended”
or plowed straight through Hume’s Guillotine the fact remains that there
are <em>true</em> values and thus there is no <em>dichotomy</em> between
facts and values.</p>
<p>This statement is incredibly controversial in the face of modern
subjectivist philosophy, where insofar as ethics is even thought about
it is dismissed out of hand as a mere description of what people want to
do. But of course, saying that a person, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> wants to do <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> over <span
class="math inline">¬<em>X</em></span> is the claim that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> thinks he <em>should</em> pick
<span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> over <span
class="math inline">¬<em>X</em></span> when given the chance—that is to
say a preference for <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> over
<span class="math inline">¬<em>X</em></span> <em>is itself</em> an
ethical claim, so choice itself has value implications. I imagine almost
everyone takes the is-ought gap for granted, thus I will take some time
to further elaborate on why the fact-value dichotomy does not exist.</p>
<p>First, values in the ethical sense are not arbitrary, insofar as a
person is engaging in any form of evaluation or making some argument or
acting at all, he is necessarily making the choice of existence over
non-existence. That is to say, to remain in reality, to claim anything
to be correct at all, you must hold life as a value. To negate the value
of life would be to immediately contradict oneself, as said negation
would have to be performed by a living man, who chooses to keep living
for the purpose of uttering his negation. The good therefore corresponds
to that which is pro-life, and the bad that which is anti-life.
Furthermore, man is not an automaton, he evaluates because he chooses,
the choice he has at any crossroads is whether to be pro-life–i.e. in
correspondence to reality–or anti-life–i.e. not in correspondence to
reality. In other words, a man has always the choice whether to accept
truth (to think) or to reject truth (to evade it). Because evading
reality is itself a rejection of truth one cannot coherently argue for
evasion, as this would involve making the truth claim that there is no
such thing as truth—to which all one can ask is, “is it <em>true</em>
that there is no such thing as truth?”</p>
<p>Because evasion or pro-falsehood is anti-life, and life is undeniably
good, evasion is undeniably bad. In other words, any is-statement
implies a set of ought-statements, and vice versa. Making a moral claim
implies pre-suppositions about epistemology and metaphysics, and making
claims about epistemology and metaphysics necessarily imply certain
things about ethics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the objective approach, since every fact bears on the choice to
live, every truth necessarily entails a value-judgment, and every
value-judgment necessarily presupposes a truth. As Ayn Rand states the
point in “The Objectivist Ethics”: “Knowledge, for any conscious
organism, is the means of survival; to a living consciousness, every
‘is‘ implies an ‘ought.’” Evaluation, accordingly, is not a
compartmentalized function applicable only to some aspects of man’s life
or of reality; if one chooses to live and to be objective, a process of
evaluation is coextensive with and implicit in every act of
cognition.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, facts about reality, such as that the sun shines, or that
lightning strikes, have implications for mans self-preservation, and
because man objectively ought endeavour to preserve himself, these
metaphysically given facts imply certain things about what man should be
doing. The fact that the sun shines and that within certain limits
sunshine is good for man implies all sorts of oughts. For instance,
other things being equal we ought grow our crops in the shine rather
than the shade, because doing so will yield more crops and thus further
mans life more than the alternative. Also we ought build our houses such
that they have windows and we can get vitamin D. But sunlight can also
cause us damage by burning our skin if we get too much of it, so other
things being equal we ought avoid this outcome, perhaps by wearing
sun-screen or bringing an umbrella for shade. “All these evaluations are
demanded by the cognitions involved
[…].”<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Again, because these things are pro-life, they are pro-truth and
reality, therefore these oughts cannot be coherently negated. Moreover,
to attempt to negate such an ought is indicative of an error in the
thinker in question—they are either making an honest mistake or they are
on an active rebellion against truth. Because error is bad, to embrace
an error as fully as does the thinker in active rebellion against truth
implies that the proper moral evaluation of this thinker is that he is
wicked. Now, this is not the case for all such instances of perpetuating
a falsehood, men are capable of making honest mistakes in their
understanding of reality, this is most prevalent in the very young or in
the intellectually impared. This is quite distinct to the academic
Marxists and other subjectivists who dedicate their lives to the
perpetuation of intellectually dishonest ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] If the conscientious attempt to perceive reality by the use of
one’s mind is the essence of honesty, no such rebellion can qualify as
“honest.”</p>
<p>The originators, leaders and intellectual spokesmen of all such
movements are necessarily evaders on a major scale; they are not merely
mistaken, but are crusading irrationalists. The mass base of such
movements are not evaders of the same kind; but most of the followers
are dishonest in their own passive way. They are unthinking,
intellectually irresponsible ballast, unconcerned with logic or truth.
They go along with corrupt trend-setters because their neighbors demand
it, and/or because a given notion satisfies some out-of-context desire
they happen to feel. People of this kind are not the helplessly
ignorant, but the willfully self-deluded.</p>
<p><strong>EVEN IN REGARD</strong> to inherently dishonest movements,
let me now add, a marginal third category of adherent is possible: the
relatively small number who struggle conscientiously, but simply cannot
grasp the issues and the monumental corruption involved. These are the
handful who become Communists, “channelers,” etc. through a truly honest
error of knowledge. Leaving aside the retarded and the illiterate, who
are effectively helpless in such matters, this third group consists
almost exclusively of the very young — and precisely for this reason,
these youngsters get out of such movements fast, on their own, without
needing lectures from others; they get out as they reach maturity. Being
conscientious and mentally active, they see first-hand what is going on
in their movement and they identify what it means; so their initial
enthusiasm turns to dismay and then to horror. (Andrei in <em>We the
Living</em> may be taken as a fictional symbol here.) The very honesty
of such individuals limits their stay in the movement; they cannot
tolerate for long the massiveness of the evil with which they have
become involved. Nor, when such youngsters drop out, do they say to the
world belligerently: “Don’t dare to judge me for my past, because my
error was honest.” On the contrary — and here I speak from my own
personal experience of honest errors that I committed as a teenager —
the best among these young people are contrite; they recognize the aid
and comfort, inadvertent though it be, which they have been giving to
error and evil, and they seek to make amends for it. They expect those
who know of their past creeds and allegiances to regard them with
suspicion; they know that it is their own responsibility to demonstrate
<em>objectively</em> and across time that they have changed, that they
will not repeat their error tomorrow in another variant, that their
error was
innocent.<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any form of ethical subjectivism which is required for the fact-value
dichotomy to stand, implies an epistemology that holds that mere whims
are the proper source of evaluation. This would make ethics (and
therefore law) a completely pointless field with no reason for existing.
That is to say, erecting Hume’s guillotine implies the complete
demolition of ethics to the chattering applause of the most evil
philosophies known to man. But, as Hoppe points
out<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup>
there are certain norms, namely property rights, must be accepted as
valid prior to beginning any ethical deliberation whatsoever, even an
ethical deliberation that seeks to destroy ethics. Therefore any ethical
theorist who attempts to erect a dichotomy between fact and value must
accept as valid certain values whilst attempting to demonstrate the
invalidity of value as such. So a philosopher qua ethical theorist
<em>cannot</em> speak of Hume’s Guillotine without falling into utter
incoherence, and thus ethical subjectivism is an incoherent
anti-ethics.</p>
<p>The immorality of error in ones understanding of the metaphysically
given, such as that the sun shines, or that gravity causes objects to
fall, pales in comparison to the immorality present wherever there are
errors in man-made facts. Consider a world of total unreason in
philosophy—such a world would imply mass death and suffering of the
worst kind as all men would be acting as did Mao and Hitler and Stalin.
No matter the level of technological development, such a society would
be incapable of supporting human life. On the contrary, a far more
technologically primitive society that accepts entirely reason and
objective reality would find barely any natural disasters that could not
be withstood. The standard of living in such a society would quickly
soar where the opposite is true of the irrational society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] To an individual in a division-of-labor society, it makes a
life-or-death difference whether he is surrounded by producers or
parasites, honest men or cheats, independent men or power-lusters. Just
as one must distinguish between good and bad in relation to the realm of
nature, so one must distinguish between good and bad in relation to the
realm of man.</p>
<p>In Objectivist terms, this means a single fundamental issue: in the
human realm, one must distinguish the rational from the irrational, the
thinkers from the evaders. Such judgment tells one whether a man, in
principle, is committed to reality — or to escaping from and fighting
it. In the one case, he is an ally and potential benefactor of the
living; in the other, an enemy and potential destroyer. Thus the mandate
of justice: identify the good (the rational) and the evil (the
irrational) in men and their works — then, first, deal with, support
and/or reward the good; and, second, boycott, condemn and/or punish the
evil.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the proper moral evaluation of an idea or more broadly a
philosophy is that it is good insofar as it promotes human flourishing,
and bad insofar as it does the opposite. This evaluation is not based on
an arbitrary whim of the evaluator, it is not the claim that the idea or
philosophy in question is merely distasteful to the man making the
evaluation. An objective evaluation must make reference to the objective
and undeniable value of life itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implicit in saying that a certain idea is true is a positive moral
estimate of the mental processes that led to it (a credit to the
individual for having worked to grasp reality), <em>and</em> a positive
estimate of the existential results to come (a true idea will have to
yield pro-life results when men act on it). The same applies <em>mutatis
mutandis</em> to false ideas. Implicit in saying that an idea
contradicts the facts of reality is a negative estimate of the processes
that led to it, and also of the effects the idea will have in practice,
which have to be harmful. If one’s ideas are tied to reality at all and
if one is guided by life as the standard, there is no way to identify an
idea’s truth or falsehood without in some form also making such
evaluations.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Truth is a product of effort and leads in action to value(s); hence,
one says, the true idea is not only true: it is also good. Falsehood,
assuming it reaches a certain scale, is a product of evasion and leads
to destruction; such an idea is not only false; it is also evil.</p>
<p>An employee, to take a relatively modest positive example, offers a
man an idea for improving the operation of his business. His idea, the
boss concludes after weighing the evidence, takes into account all the
relevant facts; he’s right. So far, this is pure cognition, the outcome
of which is expressed in a statement like: “I agree with you.” But no
decent person, whether he knows philosophy or not, would stop there; he
would not say unemotionally, like a dead fish: “Your idea is correct.
Good day.” On the contrary, precisely because the new idea represents a
new grasp of reality, the moral kind of boss is enthusiastic, i.e., he
<em>evaluates</em> the idea. He cannot avoid seeing two things: this
employee of mine had to innovate, struggle, think to reach the idea when
no one else did, and: the idea will cut my costs, increase my customers,
double my profits. The boss, accordingly, is excited, he likes his
employee, he praises him, he rewards him. He not only says about the
idea: “true.” As an inevitable corollary, he says about it: “good.” That
“good” is the evaluation or the “ought”; it represents the practice of
justice and the tie to
life.<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it is completely inescapable that true is-statements imply true
evaluations related to those statements, and false is-statements imply
false evaluations related to those statements. Just as it is an error
for the primitive man to attempt to make it rain by dancing, it is an
error to commit murder, or to steal a wallet. These actions are bad
because they are destructive of life and human flourishing, it is
impossible to construct a rational property norm where aggression is
allowed. And just as the fact that the rain-dancer is acting in error is
not negated by the fact that he is still capable of performing the
rain-dance nor is the fact that the murderer is acting in error negated
by the fact that he is still capable of murder. It is incoherent to
claim any crime to be a moral virtue, as every crime implies an evasion
of objective law, and evasions are per se errors and errors are per se
immoral. The true is the good, and the good is the true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If ethics is a normative discipline that identifies and classifies
certain sets of actions as good or evil, right or wrong, then tort or
criminal law is a <strong>subset of ethics</strong> identifying certain
actions as appropriate for using violence against them. The law says
that action X should be illegal, and therefore <em>should</em> be
combated by the violence of the law. <strong>The law is a set of “ought”
or normative propositions</strong>.</p>
<p>Many writers and jurists have claimed the law is a value-free,
“positive” discipline. Of course it is possible simply to list, classify
and analyze existing law without going further into saying what the law
should or should not be. <strong>But that sort of jurist is not
fulfilling his essential task</strong>. Since the law is ultimately a
set of normative commands, the true jurist or legal philosopher has not
completed his task until he sets forth what the law should be, difficult
though that might be. If he does not, then he necessarily abdicates his
task in favor of individuals or groups untrained in legal principles,
who may lay down their commands by sheer fiat and arbitrary caprice.</p>

Generally, the task of the political philosopher is to discover under
