<h1 id="why-people-arent-anarchists">Why People Aren’t Anarchists</h1>
<p>You probably do not consider yourself to be an anarchist—in fact
almost everybody considers anarchism to be an ideology which is
completely insane. You might have minor disagreements here and there
with other people, but anarchism is surely a whole different level of
wrongness.</p>
<p>I am here to tell you that you have been mislead. There are a few
different reasons why I think someone might reject anarchism and I will
be addressing them all.</p>
<h1 id="anarchism-as-chaos">Anarchism as Chaos</h1>
<h2 id="anarchism-defined-as-chaos">Anarchism Defined as Chaos</h2>
<p>On this first point, a typical claim might go like: “in an anarchist
society there would be no centralised government to enforce the law, so
there would be total chaos.” The first error made by this sort of claim
is that it is substituting the <em>result</em> that the claimant expects
would come from anarchy for the <em>definition</em> of anarchy.</p>
<p>This is an inversion of the correct order of operations: we need to
first establish what anarchism actually is before we can determine what
results we expect to come about from adhering to it.</p>
<p>Anarchism is a general term that applies to any philosophy that
rejects legal
authoritarianism.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
Allow me to break that down; legal authoritarianism is the thesis that
the law comes from some authority, or in other words that actions are
justified on the grounds that the preferred authority says they are. As
an example, say Robinson Crusoe is on the desert island and finds a
stick poking out of a tree. He expects that this stick would allow him
to begin spearfishing, so he fashions a point onto the end and then runs
off to the ocean to give it a go. At this point another man, Friday,
sees this stick and thinks that it would be great to stoke his fire; so
he runs up to Crusoe and attempts to wrestle it off of him.</p>
<p>If these men were so inclined to attempt to justify their respective
conduct pertaining to the stick, let’s think about what they might say.
Crusoe could argue that it is his stick because he found it first and
was already using it before Friday came over and tried to take it from
him. Friday then says that this is irrelevant, because he wants the
stick and so is justified in taking it from Crusoe. Or perhaps Friday
appeals to a villiage elder who said that Friday is the stick-keeper for
the whole island, and so that is why he is justified. You can think of
any number of different authorities that Friday might appeal to, whether
it be himself, that villiage elder, or even some sort of deity that
bestowed this power unto him—but the point is that Friday is justifying
his conduct by reference to the sayso of an authority. This means that
Friday is a legal authoritarian, with Crusoe being the legal
anarchist.</p>
<p>It is worth noting on this point that legal anarchism doesn’t mean
that there are no laws, Crusoe is not asserting that anything goes,
rather he is asserting that the law does not come from some authority
figure’s arbitrary decrees, that it is objective, that it is inherent in
nature. Accordingly, anarchism is called a theory of natural law.</p>
<p>Now, which man strikes you as being the more peaceful individual?
Surely it is Crusoe. Crusoe was minding his business and then Friday
physically attacked him and attempted to deprive him of his means of
bettering his own life. This is an important observation: anarchism is
peaceful, it is the non-anarchists who bring about chaos.</p>
<p>Anarchism as such does not provide a positive case for what the law
is; all it says is that it is non-authoritarian. This does not give us
much; it is often entirely unclear which party in any given conflict is
appealing to authority, or if either of them are. Thus, we need to turn
to a specific subset of anarchism, called anarcho-capitalism, for our
positive case.</p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism starts by recognising the fundamental problem that
law tackles: namely, scarcity. It is only because the stick is scarce
that Crusoe and Friday can come into conflict over its use. This
requires a specific understanding of the terminology—to say that a given
entity is scarce is to say that men can come into conflicts over its
use, where a conflict is defined as mutually-exclusive actions. Crusoe
cannot use the stick to spearfish at the same time that Friday uses it
to stoke his fire—one action excludes the other, i.e. they are
mutually-exclusive.</p>
<p>Thus, anarcho-capitalism holds the non-aggression principle as the
fundamental starting point for all legal analysis—where aggression means
the initiation of conflict. So for the case of the stick, we no longer
have to imagine what sort of justification Friday might bring, we can
simply see that he is the one who has initiated the conflict, and thus
his action is not justified.</p>
<h2 id="tikhistory-on-the-definition-of-anarchism">TIKhistory on the
Definition of Anarchism</h2>
<h3 id="tiks-definitions-as-package-deals">TIK’s Definitions as Package
Deals</h3>
<p>It will be shown later on why any claim contrary to the
non-aggression principle must devolve into legal authoritarianism and
why legal authoritarianism is false. For now, I must address a critique
of my semantics here forwarded by TIK. To be clear, TIK agrees with the
ancaps on ethics, at least as far as I can tell, he just disagrees with
calling it anarchism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anarchy just means no state. It doesn’t mean everything is on fire or
people are barbarians. It just means no
state.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The problem is that the dictionary definition of what a state is does
not mention coercion. The dictionaries vary but the essential definition
is that a state is a politically-organised community on a given piece of
territory. […] The idea goes like this: when humans group together they
form hierarchies. These hierarchies, when they reach a certain size, get
classed as “public” which is when they become states. […] When you have
a large hierarchy of society, that is classed as a
state.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, on this view anarchism is an ideology that is opposed to the
state, where the state is any “public” hierarchy. TIK says here that the
standard for what is “public” as against “private” is size. He
elaborates on this in another video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The family did not receive its laws from the city… Private law
existed before the city.” These families were <em>private</em> families.
Privus meaning single or individual meant–and still does–a person or
belonging to a small group of people that were separate from public
life. In a sense, small, independent, private estates rather than large
organisations.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is on this front that the entire problem with TIKs rejection of
anarchism can be found, because the definition of public as against
private that he is using is a package deal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Package-dealing” is the fallacy of failing to discriminate crucial
differences. It consists of treating together, as parts of a single
conceptual whole or “package,” elements which differ essentially in
nature, truth-status, importance or
value.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On both the private and the public front, TIK engages in
package-dealing. For him private means small and either individual or
collective (the family unit is just a small collective); and public
means large and collective. This is clear to see 33:00 into his video on
public vs private when he classes “big business” under the same term as
“central banks” and
“State.”<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
This is where the package comes from, the historical association has
been that the only way for a society to become large-scale and have any
“big” groups within it is for those groups to rule everyone else. So, if
we have a society where each individual lives peacefully with everyone
else, and operates purely on production and trade, is each person a
state? I’m tempted to say they are if there can be multiple “states” in
ancapistan like TIK
says,<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>
but all of these interactions are individual, i.e. private,
i.e. non-state. So then perhaps the “state” here encompasses the entire
private society, but then we are back to the assumption that the only
way for there to be a society is for there to be subjects who are ruled
by the same central authority. This is a problem.</p>
<p>TIK justified his classing of big business as “public” here using the
Rothbardian argument against natural monopolisation. The argument is
basically that as a firm grows in size within some particular market it
has a growing internal economy that it cannot perform calculation
within. If you want to understand this point fully I suggest you watch
this video on the economic calculation
problem<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>—but
I do not think understanding that is required here.</p>
<p>This argument is correct as far as it goes, but it does not go as far
as TIK needs it to go. The Rothbardian argument establishes only that it
is impossible for a purely voluntary firm to establish a stranglehold
over an entire market and achieve natural monopolisation. It does not
establish that no business can ever become very large in either real or
relative terms. In real terms, it is obviously possible for a firm in a
society with a high level of capital development to be “big” in
comparison to Crusoe on the island; and it is also possible for a firm
to come to some brand new and very valuable innovation that rockets them
to the top of an entirely new market for some period of time. Thus
“bigness” vs “smallness” is not the key criterion we must work upon
here. The correct criterion is collective as against individual. The
actual public entities such as the state or central banks operate
through aggressive means, they do not function on the traders
principle—rather they rely on being economic parasites sucking the blood
of the productive men in society. Those productive men may or may not
control vast wealth, because the wealth or the bigness is not the key
component.</p>
<p>Notice how this applies also on the private side of TIKs definitions;
he tells us that “private” means belonging to or for the use of one
particular person <strong>or group of people</strong> only. The
inclusion of the group here is the infection of the term with
collectivism. Thus the choice we are given is not between individualism
or collectivism, it is between small- or big-collectivism. Group
ownership is not possible, it is a contradiction in
terms.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
The idea of group ownership comes about out of pure Platonism—the idea
is that the collective is the really real thing, and that the individual
is merely a subsidiary, or cell of the collective body. <em>That</em> is
the proper division between public or private—not whether things should
be big or small, but whether the political unit and standard of value is
the one or the many, the individual or the group, Howard Roark or Henry
Cameron’s Egregore.</p>
<p>The key insight to be gleaned here is that definitions are not and
cannot be arbitrary labels for whatever you want—the words that one uses
must conform to the requirements of man’s conceptual faculty. It is the
science of epistemology that teaches us said requirements. The primary
purpose of language is to objectify
concepts,<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>
these concepts are formed by abstracting away from concrete data which
actually exists. Thus the concept itself isn’t out there in the world
ready to be seen and recalled at a moment’s notice, but by using a
symbol to stand in its place you make it perceptually graspable.</p>
<p>Any definition that relies on a package deal is thus an anathema to
the very purpose of language in the first place: instead of aiding man’s
conceptual faculty, it hinders it. Package deals are not valid concepts,
and cannot be knowledge. Any analysis that relies upon them must
therefore be entirely discarded. Anarchy accordingly does not mean the
absence of aggression <em>and</em> the absence of bigness, these are
separate concepts that must be analysed separately. The absence of
bigness is already captured by the concept of non-society. It is when
you don’t have a society that you just have lone individuals wandering
out and not interacting with others. Thus the proper way to understand
anarchy is to throw out the bigness aspect and have anarchy be the
absence of aggression. Certainly, if you have no interactions between
anyone ever, i.e. non-society, then you will have an absence of
aggression. But the alternative to this is not aggression + society. You
can have a society without aggression.</p>
<h3 id="the-nominalist-origin-of-tiks-anti-concepts">The Nominalist
Origin of TIK’s Anti-Concepts</h3>
<p>The theory of concepts that TIK is counting on in his use of
historical definitions above all else, is called nominalism. Nominalist
arguments have been maintained throughout the history of philosophy,
going right back to the Ancient Greeks, but in the context of modern
philosophy, the man we must look to in order to understand nominalism is
Thomas Hobbes.</p>
<p>Hobbes comes onto the scene during the renaissance, and was deeply
influenced by the new, scientific attitude that was proliferated at the
time. He constructed his philosophy using the methods found in geometry.
That is: he would start with basic axioms, which are then used to
produce lemmas, and draw further implications, until you have an entire
system. The axioms he chose were the basic premises of modern science.
He was second-rate in this sense—unlike better philosophers, he merely
accepted the principles that were proliferated by others without
questioning them.</p>
<p>The Platonists would tell him that the mind is supernatural, he would
accept this on its face, and by that token reject the faculty of
consciousness. Hobbes was accordingly a total materialist on
metaphysics—everything is matter in motion, just like the particles
studied by the physicists, or the chemicals studied by the chemists.
Thus there is no such thing as purpose, or goal, there are only what
Aristotle called “efficient” causes—i.e. all of existence is like a big
swirling mess of billiard balls whose motion is entirely pre-determined
by the laws of mechanics.</p>
<p>Of course, by the time Hobbes gets to his epistemology–like all
materialists–he has to smuggle in the mind, as that is the very faculty
that epistemology studies. Again here, he merely accepts a
pre-established position, namely empiricism—that all knowledge is based
on the evidence of the senses; there are no innate ideas or mystic means
of gaining knowledge on Hobbes’ philosophy.</p>
<p>How then does he account for sense perception on purely materialist
grounds? His idea, in basic terms, is that external matter strikes our
body in specific locations which then sets off a chain of various
oscillations and motions towards the brain according to the laws of
mechanics—and sensation is the way in which we experience motions in the
brain. What it means to “experience” anything if there is no such thing
as a mind, nor why we only experience these motions in the brain but not
elsewhere is left entirely unclear, which is a bit of a problem.</p>
<p>This is compounded further by his acceptance of what philosophers
call the primary/secondary quality distinction—that our senses only pick
up distorted impressions of what is “really” out there, such that the
real world is not remotely what it appears to be. In actual fact, this
position has it, the real world is colourless, soundless,
temperatureless, odourless, etc. All that really exists is quantity and
motion. So, for Hobbes, we know that the senses are invalid through a
process of thought, and that thought is based on the evidence of the
senses; so thought is supposed to invalidate that which it is based
upon. You can see, I’m sure, how the materialist position is leading
Hobbes to total epistemic suicide.</p>
<p>Allow me to draw out just one aspect of that as it pertains to
concepts. For Hobbes, thought is merely an image—a decaying sense
experience. The idea is that these motions and oscillations in the mind
slowly fade away over time into noise. Because this applies to all
thought, it applies also to concepts. This position is called
sensualism—that all cognitive elements are sense perceptions. That the
only cognitive faculty possessed by man is that of sensation.</p>
<p>Of course, on this view where all man can do is sense things, the
only thing he can be cognisant of is particulars. In other words, on
this view, it is not possible for man to abstract away from a number of
particulars to form concepts.</p>
<p>This brings us squarely to nominalism: that concepts are merely
linguistic conventions, collective names arbitrarily imposed by men on
roughly resembling particulars on the standard of subjective human
convenience. That there are no <em>real</em> universals, particulars are
the only things that exist. That man <em>creates</em> classes of
objects, rather than discovering them.</p>
<p>This nominalist-sensualist position, which has been grafted onto
empiricism since the renaissance, yields disastrous consequences on
philosophy. There can be no meaningful definitions on this view, a
definition is supposed to be a statement of the essence of some class;
but if classification is subjective and arbitrary, so too must
definitions be. Definitions can no longer be stated to be true or false,
just convenient or inconvenient—and there can be no objective standard
of convenience! This then means that there can be no general principles.
If one says that man is mortal, or socialism is slavery; he is counting
upon the definitions of those terms. But those definitions are now said
to be arbitrary, and so the general statements are also arbitrary and so
falls away general objective principles. Every dispute over principles
thus falls into the well of being a merely semantic disagreement over
how we are going to use words, rather than an actual dispute over what
is true or false.</p>
<p>As Peikoff states the point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now for instance our communist comes in and says: “I have my own
definition of slavery. Slavery by my definition […] is the state of
being wrapped up in bondage to your own selfish interests, whereas true
freedom I define as the state of being released from confining personal
concerns and being compelled to serve and love your brothers.”</p>
<p>Well, if slavery is being egoistic and freedom is being compelled to
be self-sacrificial–and this is the Platonic-Hegelian definition of
freedom and slavery–then socialism is freedom, and capitalism does rest
on
slavery.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now here at least, the communist is asserting that their definition
is correct and mine is incorrect, so there is a possibility of debating
who is right and how the words should be used. The nominalist on the
other hand completely rejects that its possible for a definition to be
anything other than a linguistic contract of sorts.</p>
<p>Thus when TIK says that the standard of which words should be used is
those which are most accepted and can thus be used to
communicate,<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup>
and when he takes the historic definition above all else, he is
implicitly adopting the nominalist viewpoint. That is to say: the
fundamental principle underlying definitions is not communication. Words
are not mere linguistic playthings that we may select at will and the
standard of their truth is not that people use them in that way.
Definitions can be objectively correct or incorrect on epistemic
grounds—and thus epistemology must be employed when we are choosing
which definition to adopt.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t think that TIK is a raging Humean or anything like
that—but this is an area where I think he is not applying the correct
methods of epistemology. He must take into account not only how the
words are used, but more fundamentally what the requirements of man’s
mind are.</p>
<h3 id="the-rothbardian-definition-as-identifying-the-essential">The
Rothbardian Definition as Identifying the Essential</h3>
<p>Furthermore, I also don’t think that TIK’s understanding of the state
just being a large collection of people lines up with what most people
think. It is my view that Murray Rothbard correctly identified what it
is that people mean when they say “state,” namely a monopoly on the use
of force. They then combine this with legal positivism which almost
everyone adopts, and thus conclude that the state is also a monopoly on
the justification of the use of force. Such that aggression done by the
state or by the state’s order is justified, whereas other aggression is
not.</p>
<p>This is why people are fine with the government stealing their money,
but not a random thug on the street. After all, if you believe that
there is a legitimate monopoly on the use of force, then that monopoly
gets to decide that certain aggressions are fine by pure fiat. A
monopoly means that you are excluding competition, this means that if
the state is justified it must be justified in preventing people from
defending property on their own, and therefore the state must be
operating under legal authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be clear here on one point—TIK brought up in his
video<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup>
that it is wrong to <em>define</em> the state as being coercive or
aggressive because the dictionary definitions do not mention coercion,
and that I myself appeal to dictionary definitions when it comes to
socialism, so it would be improper for me to drop the dictionary
all-together on this issue. First, I agree on the point that it is
incorrect to make the state coercive by definitional fiat; but I do not
think that this is what the Rothbardians are doing. Rather, Rothbard has
identified that the essence of the state is to be anti-productive,
parasitic, monopolistic in the arena of the use of force at the very
least. Then on top of that he has a separate legal theory which
identifies those activities as being nocent. So its not that the state
is that organisation that is bad; its rather the state is an
organisation that engages in certain activities that we have separately
identified as being bad. As for the point that I use dictionary
definitions myself in arguing that socialism is when the government does
stuff this does not contradict the previous analysis of certain
dictionary definitions being invalid. Those definitions were not based
on package deals or any other such flawed epistemology, and in fact
identified the proper essence of socialism—that socialism is when the
government does stuff.</p>
<p>This is why it would be invalid for socialists to change the
definition of socialism to be when puppydogs and rainbows
happen<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup>
as that would not be digging down to the essentials. Rather, what a
definition like that is doing, is it is substituting the expected
outcome of some system for the system itself—i.e. it is packaging
together what effects they think would occur with the things they think
will cause those effects. This is invalid; the definition in this case
needs to identify the cause, and then further analysis can be performed
to determine what the effect of that cause will be. The change I propose
to the definition of the state is of a different sort—it is not an
invalid poisoning of a term, it is the removal of an already established
poison. My claim is that the current dictionary definitions that TIK is
working on are in fact obfuscating the core, and that this obfuscation
should be removed.</p>
<h3 id="praxeology-as-mystic">Praxeology as Mystic?</h3>
<p>Due to the time taken to make this video, TIK has released a further
video where he draws a connection between the Austrian tradition that
anarcho-capitalism is built on with the mystic philosophy of Immanuel
Kant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From John Locke and Kant we eventually get Ludwig von Mises, and the
Austrian school of economics. And to prove the connection from Kant to
Mises, here is an article from the Mises Institute <em>this year</em>
titled: “On Immanuel Kant’s 300th birthday: Kant’s Epistemology and Its
Influence on Ludwig von Mises’s Praxeology.”</p>
<p>From the body of the article itself: “In the epistemological works of
Ludwig von Mises (1883–1971), there are not only clear parallels with
but also lines of reference to Kant’s theory of knowledge: Mises not
only employs the term a priori and occasionally references Kant, but
also rationalizes the use of a priori knowledge as the appropriate
method for the social and economic sciences – the logic of human action
(“praxeology”).” Do not shoot the messenger guys.</p>
<p>I know the Austrians have historically challenged Hegel, so I know
they’re not Hegelians, but yes, Mises’ a priori reasoning actually comes
from immanuel Kant’s explanation of that meaning that there is a Kantian
influence here. This is problematic because they have allowed mysticism
into their movement. <strong>This might not affect their basic economics
as such, but it does affect the more in-depth stuff and their
politics</strong>.</p>
<p>And this has been one of the reasons why I have been hesitent to say
where I sit on the political spectrum. Part of it is that I don’t want
to pigeon-hole myself, but part of it is because when I was reading
Mises and Rothbard, I recognised that something wasn’t quite right with
the logic. I couldn’t explain it, but I saw it and suspected it, and I
now think I understand why but that’s a topic for another day. The point
is for today that this Kantian influence is there.</p>
<p>But Ayn Rand is absolutely not influenced by Kant or Hegel whom she
totally rejects. Her connection comes from Aristotle via Thomas Aquinas
and is based in modern science. But she also rejects all religion so
Objectivism is not mystic in any way, at least not consciously. And
Murray Rothbard had been part of Ayn Rand’s group, but broke from the
movement for reasons I’m not entirely clear upon. He then accused her of
founding a cult which is ironic given the Kantian influences on his
movement.<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, I think this video is mostly correct; I even agree that
this connection between Kant and Mises has allowed some mystic elements
to remain within the modern Austrian school. This is why my
philosophical project, which is to integrate Objectivism and
anarcho-capitalism is so important; and I will explain more on that
later in the video when I respond to Ayn Rand’s points against
anarchism. Regardless I do have some things I want to address here.</p>
<p>First, I completely reject the claim made by the article that any
so-called “a priori reasoning” forms “the most robust epistemological
foundation”<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup>
for economics, or even praxeology. And I further reject that praxeology
is even close to being a sensible science on Kant’s philosophy. This is
because praxeology is just a certain science built on top of the
understanding that humans have free will. Following the naming schema
used for “praxeology,” I propose that any science of free will falls
under the banner
“epilology,”<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup>
namely epilology includes the sciences praxeology and thymology—with
thymology studying particular instances of man-made facts, and
praxeology studying general statements on the man-made as such.</p>
<p>This gives us the proper conceptual distinction–not between a priori
and a posteriori, or supposed facts of “pure” reason as against “mere”
empirical and contingent facts–but between the conceptual and the
perceptual—the general and the particular. For far too long, the
Austrian school has swallowed the poison pill that empiricism cannot
yield general and necessary truths, so they have turned to the evil
mysticism of Immanuel Kant, turning themselves away from reality to try
get a better grasp of it.</p>
<p>After all, the Objectivists have already provided a rational, this
worldly, scientific account of free will, and shown that without it
epistemology itself
falls.<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18" role="doc-backlink">18</a></sup>
The basic idea is that if determinism is true, then the determinist is
pre-destined to accept this position. How, then, does he hope to
validate it? The factors that caused him to be a determinist are clearly
not infallible, as those same factors caused other people to not be
determinists—so he must accept that man can think in error. Given the
determinist’s mind is not automatically attuned to reality, and he
claims that he has no choice over what he believes, then he cannot
validate any belief that he holds—the determinist claims that on his own
premises he cannot deliberately choose reality over fantasy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of “volition” is one of the roots of the concept of
“validation” (and of its subdivisions, such as “proof”). A validation of
ideas is necessary and possible only because man’s consciousness is
volitional. This applies to any idea, including the advocacy of free
will, to ask for its proof is to presuppose the reality of free
will.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The determinist’s position amounts to the following. “My mind does
not automatically conform to facts, yet I have no choice about its
course. I have no way to choose reality to be my guide as against
subjective feeling, social pressure, or the falsifications inherent in
being only semiconscious. If and when I distort the evidence through
sloppiness or laziness, or place popularity above logic, or evade out of
fear, or hide my evasions from myself under layers of rationalizations
and lies, I have to do it, even if I realize at the time how badly I am
acting. Whatever the irrationalities that warp and invalidate my mind’s
conclusion on any issue, they are irresistible, like every event in my
history, and could not have been otherwise.” If such were the case, a
man could not rely on his own judgment. He could claim nothing as
objective knowledge, including the theory of
determinism.<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19" role="doc-backlink">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the Austrians are correct to embrace a methodological dualism and
reject the application of the methods used to study particles and
chemicals to the study of man—but not because the study of man is
non-empirical. Rather, when one studies human action, he must take into
account the fact of free will.</p>
<p>This integration between Objectivism and anarcho-capitalism is not
idiosyncratic either. Murray Rothbard himself was an
Objectivist<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20" role="doc-backlink">20</a></sup>
<del>and the link between him and Rand deserves to be re-instated on
TIK’s
chart</del>.<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21" role="doc-backlink">21</a></sup>
As he explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just finished your novel today. I will start by saying that all of
us in the “Circle Bastiat” are convinced, and were convinced very early
in the reading, that Atlas Shrugged is the greatest novel ever
written.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>But the truly staggering thing about your novel is the vast and
completely integrated edifice, of thought and of action: the astounding
infinity of rational connections that abound, great and small,
throughout this novel. Joey says she used to wonder how a novel could
take you over ten years to write; she now wonders how you possibly could
have written all that in a mere ten years. Every page, almost every
word, has its meaning and function. I am sure that I have only scratched
the surface of tracing all the interconnections, and a good part of my
conversation consists of saying; and what of page so-and-so: do you see
how that fits in?</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>To find one person that has carved out a completely integrated
rational ethic, rational epistemology, rational psychology, and rational
politics, all integrated one with the other, and then to find each with
the other portrayed through characters in action, is a doubly staggering
event. And I am surprised that it astonishes even I who was familiar
with the general outlines of your system. What it will do the person
stumbling upon it anew I cannot imagine. For you have achieved not only
the unity of principle and person, and of reason and passion, but also
the unity of mind and body, matter and spirit, sex and politics… in
short, to use the old Marxist phrase, “the unity of theory and
practice.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I want you to know that, even without seeing you, you have had an
enormous influence upon me—even before the novel came out. […] When I
first met you, many years ago, I was a follower of Mises, but unhappy
about his antipathy to natural rights, which I “felt” was true but could
not demonstrate. You introduced me to the whole field of natural rights
and natural law philosophy, which I did not know existed, and month by
month, working on my own as I preferred, I learned and studied the
glorious natural rights tradition. I also learned from you about the
existence of Aristotelian epistemology, and then I studied that, and
came to adopt it wholeheartedly. So that I owe you a great intellectual
debt for many years, the least of which is introducing me to a tradition
of which four years of college and three years of graduate school, to
say nothing of other reading, had kept me in
ignorance.<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22" role="doc-backlink">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barbara Branden further notes in her biography of Ayn Rand that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though disagreeing with Ayn Rand’s key concept of limited government,
Murray Rothbard has stated that he “is in agreement basically with all
her philosophy,” and that it was she who convinced him of the theory of
natural rights which his books
uphold.<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23" role="doc-backlink">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would certainly reject that limited government is a “key” concept
within Objectivism—politics is held as being a very remote branch of
philosophy. But as stated I will address that point more fully later in
this video. I would like to give some indication here as to why it is
that Rothbard is basically never cited as an Objectivist, if he is
indeed one. Unfortunately, because of the Randians refusal to re-publish
works without explicit permission, many of the sources on some of the
things I will state here point to ancient websites that have since lost
the relevant documents, so I can go only on things that I have heard
other people saying. If any Randians get pissy about this, they are free
to present the relevant information in a form that has not been lost
from the internet.</p>
<p>I think that one of the major reasons why Rothbard is never called an
Objectivist is one of the many disputes he had with Rand—namely that he
neglected to cite Ayn Rand and her associates as sources. His reasoning
is supposedly that he did not want a novellist to appear in the
bibliography of any academic work. In Rand’s place, Rothbard would cite
Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas as sources for things such as the law
of causality, or natural rights. I conjecture that this is the reason
why you frequently find Rothbard being called a neo-Thomist, or
neo-Aristotelian rather than an Objectivist. That is, the various dramas
that went on between two people more than half a century ago have since
impacted the movements they founded, such that modern
anarcho-capitalists refuse to align with Ayn Rand “because that’s what
Rothbard did” and vice versa for Randians often refusing to even
consider whether further developments in legal philosophy can be
made.</p>
<p>When it’s all said and done, I think it is frankly ludicrous that
people who live decades after everyone involved in the various beefs
have long since passed would still hold onto these grudges to the extent
that they shut down their mind at any mention of debate. Yes, whether
Rothbard plagiarised from Rand might be relevant to a moral evaluation
of Rothbard-the-man; but it is not relevant to any evaluation of
anarcho-capitalism the legal theory. And, yes, whether Ayn Rand was a
meany-pie to people who disagreed with her might be relevant to a moral
evaluation of Ayn Rand-the-person; but it is not relevant to any
evaluation of Objectivism the philosophy.</p>
<p>It certainly isn’t <em>every</em> Objectivist or <em>every</em>
anarcho-capitalist who operates in this way, but it is enough that it is
worth calling out here: drop the beefs of dead people—they are utterly
irrelevant.</p>
<p>There is one last point on this front, which is that Rothbard did
make frequent use of the Kantian terminology. He explains why he does
so, despite not being a Kantian:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we consider the Action Axiom “a priori” or “empirical”
depends on our ultimate philosophical position. Professor Mises, in the
neo-Kantian tradition, considers this axiom a <em>law of thought</em>
and therefore a categorical truth <em>a priori</em> to all experience.
My own epistemological position rests on Aristotle and St. Thomas rather
than Kant, and hence I would interpret the proposition differently. I
would consider the axiom a <em>law of reality</em> rather than a law of
thought, and hence “empirical” rather than “a priori.” But it should be
obvious that this type of “empiricism” is so out of step with modern
empiricism [i.e. nominalism-sensualism] that I may just as well continue
to call it <em>a priori</em> for present purposes. For (1) it is a law
of reality that is not conceivably falsifiable, and yet is empirically
meaningful and true; (2) it rests on universal <em>inner</em>
experience, and not simply on external experience, that is, its evidence
is <em>reflective</em> rather than physical; and (3) it is clearly <em>a
priori</em> to complex historical
events.<sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24" role="doc-backlink">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, from the very beginning, anarcho-capitalism and the Rothbardian
wing of the Austrian school owe their fundamental philosophy to Ayn
Rand—not Immanuel Kant.</p>
<h2 id="the-conflation-of-jungle-ethics-with-anarchism">The conflation
of Jungle Ethics with Anarchism</h2>
<p>Moving on from TIK now, I must address those who would seek to call
anarchism chaotic by conflating it with the law of the jungle—the idea
that anything goes as far as law is concerned. Recall above that
anarchism must be opposed to legal authoritarianism—the theory that the
correct way to resolve conflicts is by appealing to some authority.
Notice then that the law of the jungle in its many forms therefore
cannot be anarchist. If the claim is that might makes right, then the
mighty justify their claim by demonstrating that they are the authority
on law by virtue of having the biggest stick in the land. Certainly,
this is not anarchist in the slightest. Anarchism does not mean no laws,
having no laws is impossible—anarchism rather means that those laws are
natural and peaceful.</p>
<p>This provides a retort also to the various other primitive, brutish,
and/or stupid varieties of supposed-anarchist thought: chief among them
the “anarcho-communists.” The term itself is a clear contradiction.
Communism holds that total metaphysical, epistemic, ethical, aesthetic,
and legal authority lies with the collective—and that accordingly the
proper way to resolve conflicts is for the individual to be crushed
under the boot and be made to be a complete slave to the whims of the
egregore. The communist cannot, therefore, appeal to any naturalistic
understanding of which individual ought be given precedence in some
conflict, as he does not recognise the individual as being a
self-sufficient existent in the first place.</p>
<p>This is why anarcho-capitalism is the only proper variant of
anarchist thought. The capitalism implies the anarchism and the
anarchism implies the capitalism. Capitalism implies anarchism because
the recognition of full private property rights implies there can be no
legal authorities that may flout or change those rights; and anarchism
implies capitalism because with no authorities to appeal to, we are left
with the non-aggression principle, which implies full private property
rights.</p>
<p>The origin of this conflation between anarchism and jungle ethics is
found in those who freeze legal positivism to the broader abstraction of
law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fallacy which may be termed “the fallacy of the frozen abstraction”
[…] consists of substituting some one particular concrete for the wider
abstract class to which it belongs—[e.g.,] substituting a specific
ethics (altruism) for the wider abstraction of “ethics.” Thus, a man may
reject the theory of altruism and assert that he has accepted a rational
code—but, failing to integrate his ideas, he continues unthinkingly to
approach ethical questions in terms established by
altruism.<sup><a id="fnr.25" class="footref" href="#fn.25" role="doc-backlink">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Legal positivism is one specific theory about what the law is, namely
it is the thesis that the existence and content of law depends upon
social facts, and not on its
merits.<sup><a id="fnr.26" class="footref" href="#fn.26" role="doc-backlink">26</a></sup>
In other words, the legal positivist claims that law is “posited,”
i.e. decreed by some authority, rather than discovered by jurists. This
leaves us with a gross false alternative: arbitrary law declared by
politicians vs arbitrary law declared by bandits; agression vs
agression; might vs might. It is the dictum of every great villain in
the history of philosophy: heads I win, tails you lose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine
which slaughters the individual. Give up your soul to a council–or give
it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. My technique,
Peter. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. Go fancy on the
trimmings, but hang on to the main objective. Give the fools a choice,
let them have their fun–but don’t forget the only purpose you have to
accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow
automatically.<sup><a id="fnr.27" class="footref" href="#fn.27" role="doc-backlink">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jungle anarchist accepts and furthers the brutish violence vs
brutish violence false alternative; taking up the side of disorganised
aggression as against organised aggression. He never stops to check his
premises and question whether aggression is required in the first place.
He merely asserts that somebody’s got to rule, so its better if that
ruling is done by syndicates, or cooperatives, or random Stirnerites
rather than a union of syndicates, or democratic republic, or a specific
Stirnerite called “dear leader.” Surely this is as far from any
reasonable conception of anarchist as one can come. Indeed, these
anarcho-idiots are entirely correct to segregate anarcho-capitalism from
their various moronic and/or brutish creeds, as they nearly universally
do. When you see such attempts made to kick out anarcho-capitalism from
the flag of “mother anarchy,” you should not protest their
disassociation from us. Rather, you should embrace this and point out
that they are distancing <em>themselves</em> from anarchism. Their facts
are correct, but their evaluation is sorely reversed.</p>
<h2 id="the-private-production-of-defense">The Private Production of
Defense</h2>
<h3 id="the-myth-of-collective-security">The Myth of Collective
Security</h3>
<p>Now that it has been established that anarchism is definitively not
chaos, it is worth explaining exactly how defense services could be
provided on the free market. After all, some people are criminal, and
the free society would need a way to deal with them. It is a general
rule of economics that a free market can more efficiently provide any
good than state central
planning;<sup><a id="fnr.28" class="footref" href="#fn.28" role="doc-backlink">28</a></sup>
however, because of that it is not possible for me to explain the
specific bureaucratic structure that would obtain on the market to
provide the service of defending one’s rights. Just as it wouldn’t be
possible to explain what the restaurant industry would look like before
one had developed. Regardless, it is possible to discuss some likely or
possible features that could exist.</p>
<p>First, I must deconstruct the myth of collective security, most
prominently advanced by Thomas Hobbes. The destruction he wrought in
epistemology by conflating empiricism with nominalism-sensualism can be
found in the political realm also—it is accepted by legion political
philosophers and economists that a only a state can provide security
against invasions of one’s property. The argument goes that in the state
of nature men are all snarling beasts who are constantly at each others
throats, doing anything in their power to invade and expropriate what
has been produced by others. In other words, Hobbes has it that there
would be a permanent underproduction of security—each individual, left
to his own devices, would spend too little on his own defense, thus
constant interpersonal warfare would result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The solution to this presumably intolerable situation, according to
Hobbes and his followers, is the institution of a state. In order to
institute peaceful cooperation among themselves, two individuals, A and
B, require a third independent party, S, as ultimate judge and
peacemaker. However, this third party, S, is not just another
individual, and the good provided by S, that of security, is not just
another “private” good. Rather, S is a <em>sovereign</em> and has as
such two unique powers. On the one hand, S can insist that his
<em>subjects</em>, A and B, not seek protection from anyone but him;
that is, S is a compulsory territorial monopolist of protection. On the
other hand, S can determine unilaterally how much A and B must spend on
their own security; that is, S has the power to impose taxes in order to
provide security
“collectively.”<sup><a id="fnr.29" class="footref" href="#fn.29" role="doc-backlink">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On its face, even if we grant the premise that men are brutes who
must necessarily be at war with each other, it is entirely unclear how
exactly this is any solution to this problem at all. Surely the
sovereign is just as brutish as his subjects and now has the territorial
monopoly and compulsory funding to externalise the costs of his
aggression onto a vast array of victims who are forced to pay for their
own victimisation. It is clear that this sovereign is no protector at
all—rather, he is the greatest brute of them all. A rights-protecting
violator of rights is simply a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, so long as multiple states, <span
class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, ⋯, <em>S</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>,
exist, just as there is supposed to be constant warfare between <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> in the state of anarchy, so too
must there be constant warfare between these different states. Indeed,
we do find that states engage in near constant war with each other, so
this could be a point in favour of Hobbes and would imply that a world
government must be implemented to reduce the level of violence.</p>
<p>However, this point does not account for the actual observed
relations between the subjects of different states. These subjects are
just as surely in a state of anarchy with respect to each other as they
would be without any states at all, but we find that the private
dealings between individuals who reside in different countries are for
the most part entirely amicable.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also not clear how such a world government would be
an improvement in the provision of security as compared to competing
private firms and individual defense. For this state would have to be
the winner of all wars, the biggest brute in the land, the most skilled
at expropriating its subjects to fund violence and the most capable at
engaging in violence ever seen. This would then not be the most
protective agency ever, but the complete opposite—it would be the last
surviving protection racket. This makes it the biggest danger that any
man would face in his life, and it is specifically this danger that
Hobbes advocates be free to do as it pleases. At least in his state of
nature it is possible for me to overwhelm a single foe who attempts to
waylay me on the side of the road—but what possible means of defense
could I muster against the giga-Leviathan, which has already proven
itself to be superlative at the craft of war?</p>
<p>So the Hobbesian myth stands as completely false and absurd <em>even
if</em> one grants the premise that men are naturally brutish—but let’s
go further and examine this premise. First, man has free
will<sup><a id="fnr.30" class="footref" href="#fn.30" role="doc-backlink">30</a></sup>
and can as such choose either peaceful productivity or brutish
anti-productivity. It is in the world where the philosophy of the day is
that of evasion that a correspondent brutishness and statism arise; if
the philosophy of the day were one of thought and objectivity, then men
would understand that production is the proper way to live. So contrary
to the claim at hand, it is not that a state is required to civilise
naturally brutish men; rather it is that when men choose brutality they
form states to engage in it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the entire purpose of protecting rights in the first
place is to allow for the flourishing of mankind. The reason why Crusoe
would want to be free of conflict is so that he can be productive. Thus
shifting the infringement of rights onto an institutionalised
(protected) anti-productive class is an anathema to the very problem
that had to be solved in the first place, as such an institution would
tend to maximise the price of protection (i.e. taxes) whilst minimising
the quality.</p>
<p>Quite simply, given that the principle of government requires that it
be a judicial monopoly with the power to tax, any notion of limiting
it’s power and safeguarding individual life and property is illusory;
necessarily the state tends towards greater expropriation and less
protection, because the sovereign is motivated by self-interest (albeit
irrational) and the disutility of labour just as anyone else. Why
allocate more resources towards protecting citizens than the minimum
required to keep them in line and preserve their property for your own
future expropriation? On Hobbes, the sovereign would <em>have</em> to do
this because he is supposed to be a brute.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the sovereign is, contrary to the Hobbesian
premise, an angel who wants to try his best to provide the correct level
of protection, it is simply not possible for him to do this. He is faced
with the unanswerable question of how much security must be rationally
allocated and in what form(s) it should be produced. Should he give
every citizen a handgun? Should he post armed guards on every street
corner? Should he have a police patrol every 10 miles? He cannot answer,
because the economic calculation problem stands in his way. I have
already explained the ECP in this
video,<sup><a id="fnr.31" class="footref" href="#fn.31" role="doc-backlink">31</a></sup>
so I will not repeat the explanation here. You can read the full
deductive argument on my wiki if you do not wish to watch the
video.<sup><a id="fnr.32" class="footref" href="#fn.32" role="doc-backlink">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Regardless, in the statist society there will also exist a tendency
toward a deterioration in the quality of justice, because if one can
only appeal to the government for justice and protection, justice and
protection will invariably be perverted in favour of the government.
Even the constitutions and supreme courts that are supposed to limit
this may be interpreted and administered solely by the government—the
very agents who are supposed to be limited are the ones who determine
what the limit is. “Accordingly, the definition of property and
protection will continually be altered and the range of jurisdiction
expanded to the government’s
advantage.”<sup><a id="fnr.33" class="footref" href="#fn.33" role="doc-backlink">33</a></sup></p>
<p>It is in the near universal acceptance of the myth of collective
security that we find another odious false alternative. On the one hand,
the so-called capitalists accept Hobbes’ premises, then conclude that
the only way to protect private property is to collectivise the
invasions thereof; and on the other hand, the communists will accept the
same premises, and claim the banner of anarchism as an anti-capitalist,
anti-property stance. We are left yet again with the alternative of
collectivism vs collectivism.</p>
<h3 id="defense-as-an-insurance-good">Defense as an Insurance Good</h3>
<p>Now that the fundamental philosophical backing for statism is in
ruin, I may build the positive case for the private production of
defense. First, the threat of aggression against one’s property is a
form of risk, and there are two potential ways to deal with any risk on
the market: (1) through your own privately controlled means; and (2)
through the use of an insurance agency.</p>
<p>So, we must analyse whether defense is an insurable good. After all,
I may not take out insurance against <em>any</em> risk that I
face—namely, I cannot insure myself against those risks whose outcome I
have control over. On the market I could not rightly get insurance
against setting my own house on fire, as I could then simply pay in the
first premium, set my house alight, and immediately get
compensation—such a non-discriminatory insurance firm could not
profit.</p>
<p>So clearly a defense insurer could not insure one against any
aggression that they themselves provoke. Norms of peaceful,
conflict-avoiding conduct would have to be implemented into the
contracts which would bind the insured to civilised behaviour. In
defending against any risk that is non-insurable, one must utilise their
own personal means, which would still be far more effective than the
current heavily restricted weapons that the state allows one to
possess.</p>
<p>Moreover, any defensive action taken–either by an insurance firm or
in personal self-defense–would tend to minimise any collateral damage.
This is because if in the process of some defensive action I thereby
damage the insured property of innocents I will have to face not a sole
aggressor or small gang, but a large firm capable of extracting
restitution from me. As such, collectivist weapons such as bombs,
weaponised diseases, and chemical attacks would tend to not be used in
favour of precision strikes against only aggressive targets. This is
quite on the contrary to current statist methods of invasion and
retaliation which make frequent use of collective attacks; not caring in
the slightest about collateral damage, or in some cases, even maximising
collateral damage. After all, when it comes to interstate warfare,
killing off the civilian population of your enemy reduces the total pool
of taxable resources available to the enemy state in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to this tendency for free-market defense towards
precision in lieu of sweeping destruction; any defense insurance firm
would have both the incentive to provide effective defense and likely
the resources to engage in it. Even in their heavily restricted form
today, insurance firms control vast arrays of capital spread across the
globe which they can use to compensate anyone who makes a claim on their
policy. After all, if an insurer does not have such a warchest of
resources, nobody would trust them to have the means to pay up should
the time come. Thus they would have to publicly show that they are in
control of great capital holdings not subject to the risk of immediate
state seizure. Because these firms would have to dip into their own
resources to pay off anyone whose property was not adequately protected,
they have the incentive not just to vigorously track down and extract
restitution from the criminals, but also to efficiently predict and
mitigate crime before it happens; which is in stark distinction to the
state method of forcing victims to pay for the shelter, feeding, and
entertainment of their aggressors through taxation.</p>
<p>This tendency enacts a civilising process, in contrast to the
decivilising one created by monopoly “protection” under a state. All
other things being equal, men would prefer to have their property under
a lower risk of predation; so as the risk of aggression increases, the
value of property decreases. On the one hand, in low-risk-high-value
(i.e. “good”) neighborhoods, insurance rates could be low in accordance
with the low risk of predation; and on the other hand, in
high-risk-low-value (i.e. “bad”) neighborhoods, insurance rates would be
accordingly higher. This creates a tendency for productive individuals
to move to and invest their resources in good as against bad areas. In
contrast, those who are in good neighborhoods under state-monopoly
protection are forced to pay more in taxes in order to subsidise those
who languish in the bad neighborhoods—shifting resources from
civilisation to decivilisation.</p>
<p>Not only does this hypothetical free-market in defensive services
have the benefits that there would tend to not be total war, the victims
would be compensated rather than the aggressors, and that accordingly
resources are shifted away from predation and towards production; but
also even current insurance agencies already utilise free market
arbitration systems rather than statist courts. These free-market
dispute resolution firms would only become more effective and more
broadly used without the state forcefully positioning itself as the
“true” “court of the land” that may be appealed to if one does not like
the just verdicts of private judges.</p>
<p>It is often asserted that we need this “arbiter of last resort” with
monopoly power over all others for justice to be served. But the exact
opposite is the case. The more independent judges are in applying their
judgement to some case, the better off we are. On the one hand, the
capitalist judge is at the very least <em>trying</em> to do justice in
some specific case he has before him, and on the other, the monopoly
judiciary must necessarily tend towards a systematic perversion of
justice by the fact that it is a monopoly. Law is not subjective or
intrinsic, it cannot be decreed from on high by the standard of “he’s
the guy with the biggest gavel.” Objective legal principles can be
applied <em>only</em> when rational men are able to use their rational
judgement to do justice without the razor of Damocles that is an arbiter
of last resort constantly undercutting them.</p>
<p>One final point must be addressed here before the positive case for
private defense insurance is complete: namely, in a capitalist society,
what methods could free peoples utilise in order to defend themselves
against state aggression? First, it is worth questioning <em>why</em> a
sovereign would wish to do this in the first place. <em>Who</em> would
they be invading? There is no competing sovereign or state in this area
to direct his attacks towards, there are only freely associating people,
each engaged in their own individual behaviours. These free men would
tend to have not aggressed against any citizens in the invading nation,
and they would tend to have not provoked any aggressions from the
invaders for reasons previously stated. Any individual who was engaged
in such provocation or aggression would quickly become unwelcome in the
free society, forced to live on the outskirts where the state may simply
arrest him without needing to invade. Furthermore, options for casus
belli become quite limited without a single collective state to pin
grievances onto. Any state must in some way justify its conduct to the
men who would be carrying out its crimes, the justification needn’t be
good, but it needs to exist. There would be no terrorist attacks coming
from the free people, the free people would not be seeking any
expansionist wars against neighboring territories, and they would be
engaged in no internal ethnic cleansings or other such “crimes against
humanity” to be used as a justification for attack.</p>
<p>It would be quite the risk indeed for any sovereign to show their
hand by attempting to wipe out clearly innocent and peaceful men; far
easier to stick to standard inter-state conflict. Indeed, the wars
fought by the predominant empire, the United States, are justified on
the Hobbesian grounds that there must be a single powerful world
sovereign who can overwhelm all others. But these attacks are pointed,
then, at other sovereigns, rather than random businessmen and
industrialists who do not represent any contest in the ruling of
subjects.</p>
<p>However, let’s say that a state does find such a cause for
invasion–perhaps justified on the grounds that the capitalists are
selfishly hogging wealth and exploiting the workers of the world–how
could the state expect to win in such a conflict? Recall that the state
in its capacity as a monopolistic expropriator of wealth tends to
provide lower quality and less efficient services; thus the free
capitalists would be in a far superior fighting position per dollar
spent. Any invading state would face not disarmed civilians who rely
upon a central power to protect them, but the most well-armed population
ever seen on planet Earth. Each individual would be capable of
neutralising scores of enemy combatants at the flick of his wrist. If
the biggest military ever failed to win a war against a bunch of rice
farmers living under communism, how would any state stand even the
slightest chance against hyper-industry incentivised to immediately deal
with any threats that face it, and with the means to do so?</p>
<p>The Randian war-hawks have it that examples such as Vietnam and the
various Middle Eastern wars do not demonstrate that America is impotent
as a matter of economic necessity, but rather that the American
government is impotent by choice. Peikoff has it that if America would
utterly destroy the Iranian government, up to and including the glassing
of the entire territory with nuclear weapons, that then the military
goals of the US are
achievable.<sup><a id="fnr.34" class="footref" href="#fn.34" role="doc-backlink">34</a></sup>
The assertion is that the US operates as a paper tiger with respect to
these regions, wearing kiddy gloves and refusing to use its full
might—and that this is why it constantly fails at these military
objectives against guerillas.</p>
<p>Putting aside the total moral abhorrence and collectivism inherent in
these arguments about using force against civilisans in so-called “enemy
territories,” it strikes me that this “paper tiger” claim is completely
at odds with the example of the Vietnam war. The US military would
routinely shell mountain-sides with long-range artillery, burn down
entire jungles with napalm strikes, and spray chemical agents over vast
swathes of land. In fact, the US military dropped more than double the
<em>entire</em> yield of all explosives used in WW2 <em>including</em>
the atom bombs during the Vietnam war. All of this and they
<em>still</em> didn’t take out some commie rice farmers. This hardly
strikes me as what a “paper tiger” would do, and certainly points to the
fact that guerilla strategies are simply massively successful against
giant collectivist militaries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we assume that we have an established free region,
rather than commie rice farmers, there would have been in the preceding
however-many-years a steady brain drain from statist countries to the
capitalist society. The states of the world would find themselves with
an ever-reducing scientific community to develop weaponry and devise
methods of attack.</p>
<p>Insurance firms would also surely recognise the acute threat posed by
any neighboring state and would as such charge higher insurance premiums
from areas likely to be the target of invasion. These higher premiums
would have to be justified by a demonstrable improvement to defensive
instalments in these areas. Any insurance firm that hopes to stay in
business would have to keep track of statist military movements and
capabilities through advanced intelligence services, and would have to
be capable and prepared to overwhelm any force that arrives through
sufficient equipment and training. Any statist invaders would face
long-range precision weaponry that had only been dreamed about in the
minds of science fiction authors. It would be very challenging to muster
the morale required to send archers and stone-throwers to invade a
sophisticated multi-domain and highly-adaptive power.</p>
<p>Insurance firms could also engage in offensive surgical strikes
against key state opponents. Any warmongerer could be efficiently
dispatched by stealthy assassins or orbital strikes. These offensive
capabilities would minimise collateral damage, yielding minimal
resistance from state subjects—those subjects could be further imbibed
with constant and effective propaganda about how much better life is
under capitalism. Any attempted invasion against the capitalists would
very quickly yield a decisive response from basically every insurance
agency in the area; and perhaps others abroad who wish to discourage war
against free people. These invasions could thus very well spell the end
of any regime who attempts them, leaving way for all-too-eager coups
whose progenitors promise to not invoke the wrath of their military and
intellectual superiors.</p>
<h3 id="why-private-defense-services-have-not-arrived">Why Private
Defense Services Have NOt Arrived</h3>
<p>So, if free market defensive services are so superior to the statist
offerings, why have they not arrived? The answer, in short, is that the
philosophy of the day does not allow for it. I will be making a detailed
video on the philosophy of history that will more-fully explain this
point in the future–and in fact the original version of this script
contained such an explanation–but for now I must remain brief in giving
an explanation of Leonard Peikoff’s philosophical theory of history.</p>
<p>The basic premise underlying this idea is that man has free will, and
as such the type of society which obtains at any point in history must
be the result of the choices made by the men who live in it.
Fundamentally, the choices men make will be influenced by the philosophy
they hold—if a man believes that knowledge can be gained only by
appealing to the mystic divinations of temple priests or Keynesian
economists then he will find himself weak and dependent. If the
philosophy of the day teaches man that his only moral worth can be found
in doing his duty and that this demands he not live for himself, then he
will be primed to obey the orders of any tyrant who comes along.</p>
<p>This is the key insight for our topic here. If men broadly accept a
philosophy that implies a statist politics, this will practically result
in the average man having less and less control over his own life, and
more and more dependence upon the government. Through every inevitable
crisis that results from such a system, the man will feel ever less in
control and ever less able to shape his own life and achieve wellbeing,
and he will be accordingly driven deeper into the well of dependence
upon the ones who rule him.</p>
<p>All the while the intellectuals spend their time degrading the
individual, telling him that his mind is helpless, he cannot know
anything, thought is untrustworthy, there are no answers, there are no
absolutes, that he must share his wealth, that his race is evil, and
that his only goal in life should be to see how fully he can destroy
himself for the collective.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the state makes up a tiny fraction of the
population—they cannot control men by brute force. The sovereign counts
on men to follow an anti-individual philosophy, such that they will
cheer with glee as everything good is destroyed. A philosophy that would
shape a free society would have men thinking for themselves, acting
independently, working for their own sake and for their own happiness.
If this is the philosophy that men accept then it would become the
standard that everyone would expect—and as such these would be the
standards adopted by institutions and those that men would learn to
follow.</p>
<p>For there to be a society that accepts anarcho-capitalism and
operates on the terms set by private property, there must first be a
rational, this-worldly philosophy accepted by the masses. There must
first be an acceptance of Objectivism.</p>
<h1 id="anarchism-as-immoral">Anarchism as Immoral</h1>
<h2 id="the-integration-of-objectivism-and-anarcho-capitalism">The
Integration of Objectivism and Anarcho-Capitalism</h2>
<p>Thus I may now turn my attention towards my aforementioned
integration of anarcho-capitalism with Objectivism. In my view,
Objectivism is the only proper philosophical basis for the
anarcho-capitalist legal theory, and the anarcho-capitalist legal theory
is the only proper legal theory on Objectivist philosophy.</p>
<p>First, the need to have a sound philosophy for a sound legal theory
comes from the fact that law is a highly remote area of philosophy. Law
is the subset of ethics which specifically tells man what he should do
with respect to conflicts—should they be avoided or not? When should
they be avoided or not? Are they ethically relevant or not? This is the
area that law tackles and it obviously depends in the first case on
ethics itself. If there are no ethical truths, then there cannot be
legal truths either, and we are forced to retreat into subjectivism or
relativism. If there are ethical truths but they are intrinsic and come
from the mystical dictate of a king or God, this will clearly lead to a
legal philosophy which holds law as being intrinsic also.</p>
<p>This has happened–and still happens–in the real world application of
law to specific disputes. During the Salem witch trials it was not
uncommon to have testimony reach the court alleging that someone had
committed a spiritual attack against a person. The accusers claim was
taken as so-called “spectral evidence” that this attack had actually
occurred. Per USLegal.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spectral evidence refers to a witness testimony that the accused
person’s spirit or spectral shape appeared to [the] witness in a dream
at the time the accused person’s physical body was at another location.
It was accepted in the courts during the Salem Witch Trials. The
evidence was accepted on the basis that the devil and his minions were
powerful enough to send their spirits, or specters, to pure, religious
people in order to lead them astray.</p>
<p>In spectral evidence, the admission of victims’ conjectures is
governed only by the limits of their fears and imaginations, whether or
not objectively proven facts are forthcoming to justify
them.<sup><a id="fnr.35" class="footref" href="#fn.35" role="doc-backlink">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This legal principle comes directly from the supernaturalistic
metaphysics of the Puritans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Puritans believed that physical realities had spiritual causes.
For example, if the crop failed, the Devil may have played a role—and
Satan could not take the form of an unwilling person. So if anyone
claimed to have seen a ghost or spirit in the form of the accused, that
person must be a witch. With this worldview, it was not a stretch for
Puritans to believe in spectral evidence, which was the primary evidence
used as proof of
guilt.<sup><a id="fnr.36" class="footref" href="#fn.36" role="doc-backlink">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a false philosophy as the grounding, even the most sound legal
theory cannot properly map onto reality. After all, one can imagine that
even if the Puritans accepted wholeheartedly the non-aggression
principle, they could simply hold that these spectral attacks initiate
conflict and are thus illicit. Perhaps the Marxian completely agrees
with any argument one might come forth with that the only proper legal
principle is non-aggression, but claim that this applies only to the
bourgeoisie with their bourgeois logic—if we were so-conditioned to
accept proletarian logic, we would understand that individual property
rights are illusory and that the proper meaning of liberty involves
total obedience to the collective.</p>
<h2 id="rands-politics">Rand’s Politics</h2>
<h3 id="value-vs-force">Value vs Force</h3>
<p>So anarcho-capitalism requires Objectivism. Now, before elaborating
on why Objectivism properly understood yields anarcho-capitalism, it is
worth going over the case Rand gives for her–decidedly not
anarchistic–politics. Before I can give a proper case for politics as
Rand sees it, I must establish a more fundamental ethical principle,
which I agree with Rand on: namely that the initiation of force is a
moral
evil.<sup><a id="fnr.37" class="footref" href="#fn.37" role="doc-backlink">37</a></sup></p>
<p>The justification of this principle on Objectivist grounds is that
the mind cannot work under compulsion—in order to make a man act against
his judgement you must nullify his judgement. This is what is meant by
the use of force. There would be no reason to force a man to do what he
was already planning to do—insofar as you are actually forcing him, you
must be making him act <em>against</em> his own rational judgement,
i.e. you are making him act as his own destroyer. What this means is
that force and value are entirely opposed to each other—you can have
either one or the other.</p>
<p>This is a perspective unique to Objectivism within the history of
philosophy—the two main opposing schools, intrinsicism and subjectivism,
both reject it in their own way.</p>
<p>The intrinsic school holds that values have nothing to do with a
man’s perception, his evaluation, or the context of his life. On this
view “value” is an intrinsic attribute of something, knowledge of which
is derived through mystic means. Therefore, they say, values can be
forced upon a man against his own judgement and “for his own
good”—because value has nothing to do with his judgement, even forcing
him to act against his judgement can be a value to him. You can achieve
the good for someone else at the point of a gun.</p>
<p>The subjectivists take the other side of the mind-body
false-dichotomy but arrive at the same conclusion. On subjectivism,
something is a value if one merely claims it to be, as “value” is a mere
arbitrary name that tells us nothing about the world, only giving
insight into a so-called relation of ideas. Because there are no
objective values on this viewpoint, a value can be whatever a man claims
it to be. If a man feels that he is right in robbing or beating his
fellow men, then he is—if he feels that something is good, then it is.
Given subjective feelings are the standard, one could not possibly hope
to convince others of a moral view through rational argumentation—thus
the only remaining option is to force others to obey your arbitrary
whims.</p>
<p>The error of both schools is found in their attempted separation of
values from the mind—that values are whatever is in accord with gods
plan, irrespective of judgement; or that values are based on arbitrary
whim completely divorced from the faculty that judges. Neither school
recognises that a value is a value <em>as evaluated by a thinking mind
through the application of a rational standard</em>. Values cannot exist
without a mind there to do the evaluating, namely, a man’s <em>own</em>
mind. Just as others cannot digest food for you, so too can they not
think or evaluate for you.</p>
<p>The brute exists as a parasite. He does not produce values himself,
rather his survival depends on the values produced by those whom he
predates upon. They undercut themselves in this activity—they are
attacking and destroying the very root of their own sustenance. They
rely on the universe to make A non-A, to yield an effect without the
cause, to conform to their wishes.</p>
<h3 id="the-moral-society">The Moral Society</h3>
<p>Now that it has been established that force and value are
incompatible, we can move into the territory of the Randian politics
proper. So, the case is something like the following: if man is to live
he requires a code of values to guide his actions—living in a society is
such a value to man if it is the right <em>kind</em> of
society.<sup><a id="fnr.38" class="footref" href="#fn.38" role="doc-backlink">38</a></sup>
Politics is the branch of philosophy that seeks to define the principles
that must undergird a society if it is to be a value to man—that is, the
principles of a moral society.</p>
<p>First it must be noted that the individual is the unit of reality and
the standard of value. That is, society is a derivative concept that has
no existence unto itself—a group is a group <em>of individuals</em>,
rather than the other way around. This means that any politics that
proceeds in its analysis by concerning itself with “the good of the
many” or any other such similar notion must be completely discarded on
its face.</p>
<p>The most basic principle in politics is inalienable, individual
rights. Our preceding analysis makes clear why it is that rights must be
individual: the individual is the basic political unit and so the theory
of rights must be a theory of <em>individual</em> rights if it is to be
considered rational. The rights must be inalienable because the
alternative is not a right, but a permission—if my rights are subject to
the arbitrary decrees of some king, or duke, or other such figure, then
I must receive <em>permission</em> from him to engage in some activity.
This is the key insight here: a right can only mean a principle that
defends the individual from others—this is accordingly a theory of
<em>negative</em>, not <em>positive</em> rights.</p>
<p>A so-called positive right would be something like my having a right
to healthcare. Such a theory of rights is faced with an immediate
contradiction: if I have a right to receive the services of doctors no
matter what they want to do, then those doctors must no longer have the
right to live their own life. Force must be used against the doctors to
make them comply, but as explained above this means nullifying the
doctors’ basic means of survival: their minds. That is, if I demand this
treatment and should get it, then they no longer have the right to live;
if I demand it and should not get it, then I no longer have the right to
their labour—the two are mutually-exclusive.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Rand defined a right as “a moral principle defining and
sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social
context.”<sup><a id="fnr.39" class="footref" href="#fn.39" role="doc-backlink">39</a></sup>
A right is a <em>moral</em> principle because it stands as the
precondition for a society to be a value to man; it defines and
sanctions mans “freedom of action” because it is and must be negative;
it does so in a social context because there is no society to protect
man from without said context.</p>
<h2 id="open-vs-closed">Open vs Closed</h2>
<p>Now that I have elucidated the Objectivist politics–at least
briefly–I must turn to my dispute with it, which impinges upon a great
schism within the Objectivist movement: namely, the debate over whether
Objectivism is an open or closed system. If Objectivism is a closed
system, that is, if it is just whatever beliefs in philosophy that Ayn
Rand held, then it can never develop or shift from the moment of her
death. In this case, the preceding analysis of Rand’s politics
<em>is</em> the Objectivist politics. If, on the other hand, Objectivism
is an open system, then “Ayn Rand said so” cannot stand as an argument
for the preceding analysis being the <em>Objectivist</em> politics.</p>
<p>Let me first state that I am not going to give the standard case for
Objectivism being an open system as forwarded by Stephen
Hicks.<sup><a id="fnr.40" class="footref" href="#fn.40" role="doc-backlink">40</a></sup>
I think that Craig Biddle gave an unanswerable objection to Hicks’
presentation of open Objectivism in their
debate.<sup><a id="fnr.41" class="footref" href="#fn.41" role="doc-backlink">41</a></sup>
Namely: Hicks has it that Objectivism means true philosophy—this is a
frozen abstraction and must therefore be entirely disallowed within our
conceptual framework. Objectivism is not a science, it is a particular
philosophical theory.</p>
<p>I do want to be clear here because this debate often gets fairly
heated; I hold no animosity or contempt to anybody in the Atlas Society

Objectivism.<sup><a id="fnr.42" class="footref" href="#fn.42" role="doc-backlink">42</a></sup>

Objectivism in the context of this video should be taken <em>only</em>
to mean that theory that Objectivism means whatever beliefs in
philosophy Ayn Rand held. I hold to a different sort of open Objectivism
than that of Kelley or Hicks. Namely: I don’t hold that Objectivism
means true philosophy, <em>or</em> that it means whatever beliefs in
philosophy are held by Ayn Rand—in my view, Objectivism is the
philosophy of the primacy of existence.</p>
<p>The primacy of existence is basically the view that existence is the
most fundamental fact. That <em>first</em> one must have it that
existence exists, <em>then</em> one can recognise that they are
conscious of it. To explain this view, it is worth contrasting it with
the opposing view—the primacy of consciousness. One form of this is
found in Descartes’ <em>cogito ergo sum</em>—I think, <em>therefore</em>
I am. The starting point for Descartes is an “I think,” not an “it is.”
Another form of it is found in the religious viewpoint that reality
requires a cause, and that this cause must be the consciousness they
call God. This is also the primacy of consciousness—supernatural
thoughts are held as the fundamental which comes before reality.</p>
<p>If you are interested in why the primacy of existence is true, I
refer you to this wiki
article<sup><a id="fnr.45" class="footref" href="#fn.45" role="doc-backlink">45</a></sup>
I wrote on the subject. Regardless, to justify the claim that
Objectivism means the philosophy of the primacy of existence, let me
consult the standard Objectivist account of definition; namely, that a
definition is a statement that identifies the nature of a concept’s
units:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proper definition is made of two parts, each of which follows from
the nature of concept-formation. When we form a concept, we isolate its
units by grasping a distinguishing characteristic. In the definition,
this becomes what the medieval Aristotelians called the differentia.
Further, we can differentiate only on the basis of a wider
characteristic, the [conceptual common-denominator], which is shared
both by the concretes we are isolating and by the concretes from which
we are isolating them. In the definition, this gives rise to the
genus.</p>
<p>A definition in terms of genus and differentia is like a logical X
ray of a concept. It condenses into a brief, retainable statement the
essence of the concept-forming process: it tells us what distinguishes
the units and from what they are being distinguished, i.e., within what
wider group the distinction is being made. To give the standard example:
if we conceptualize man by differentiating men from dogs, cats, and
horses, then “animal” would be the genus—“rational,” the
differentia.<sup><a id="fnr.46" class="footref" href="#fn.46" role="doc-backlink">46</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for my definition, that Objectivism is the philosophy of the
primacy of existence, the <em>genus</em>–the common
denominator<sup><a id="fnr.47" class="footref" href="#fn.47" role="doc-backlink">47</a></sup>–is
philosophy. Objectivism is a philosophy, like everything else which is a
philosophy. What makes Objectivism different to all other
philosophies–the <em>differentia</em>–is that Objectivism explicitly
identifies and applies the primacy of existence to every philosophical
issue.</p>
<p>Let me explicate this with respect to a few areas. In metaphysics,
the most fundamental branch of philosophy, we have it that according to
Rand’s legal and intellectual heir, Leonard Peikoff, “[…] the essence of
metaphysics […] is the step-by-step development of the corollaries of
the existence
axiom.”<sup><a id="fnr.48" class="footref" href="#fn.48" role="doc-backlink">48</a></sup>
So the <em>essence</em> of the <em>Objectivist</em> approach to
metaphysics according to its de-facto living leader is the development
of the fact that existence exists and that it is not subject to change
by thought.</p>
<p>The basic approach underlying this carries on up to the
epistemology—the philosophy of knowledge. What it means to be
<em>objective</em> in epistemology, according to standard Objectivism,
is to appeal to reality. It is the recognition of reality. This is so
because existence has primacy over consciousness. Every single doctrine
found within the Objectivist epistemology is based on the premise that
reality exists independently of you, and that the role of your
consciousness is merely to discover facts about it, or–if you choose
to–obscure those facts.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think you get the point—the <em>essence</em> of
Objectivism is this consistent application of the primacy of existence
to every philosophical issue. This is a uniquely Objectivist viewpoint,
and is in fact what Objectivists mean when they tell you to be
objective<sup><a id="fnr.49" class="footref" href="#fn.49" role="doc-backlink">49</a></sup>–the
very namesake of the philosophy–namely: that objectivity means adherence
to the primacy of existence. Even Aristotle was not fully consistent in
this approach. He failed to explicitly identify and apply the primacy of
existence—the most fundamental thing in his metaphysics is not that
existence exists, but rather that the Prime Mover thinks about his own
thoughts.</p>
<p>I have thus satisfied both requirements of a definition on
Objectivist grounds—I have a genus (philosophy) and differentia (the
explicit application of the primacy of existence). And I do not fall
into the same frozen abstraction objection brought forth by Biddle,
because I am not <em>defining</em> Objectivism as “true philosophy.” To
be sure, Objectivism is true philosophy <em>on</em> my definition, but
not <em>by</em> definition as it is with more primitive forms of open
Objectivism—rather, Objectivism is true philosophy <em>because the
primacy of existence is true</em>. So if somehow I were to be convinced
that the correct approach in, say, aesthetics is to appeal to Platonic
forms or something, I would consider that Platonic aesthetics to be part
of true philosophy, but not part of Objectivism. The Platonic method
would here be supposedly yielding truth, but it would not be adhering to
the unique Objectivist innovation which is to explicitly apply the
primacy of existence to <em>every</em> philosophical issue.</p>
<p>This is why my definition is correct, as against the innumerable
other attempts made to define the philosophy. For instance, you will
hear legion Randians attempt to define it as “the philosophy of Ayn
Rand.” To be clear: I am not, here, referring to the fact that Peikoff’s
book is called <em>Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand</em>. That’s
a fine book title. I am referring to the numerous people I have had
legitimately approach the question “what is the definition of
Objectivism?” with “it’s the philosophy that Ayn Rand came up with.” The
essence of Objectivism simply is not that Ayn Rand discovered it. This
is a non-definition, the Randian has failed to identify any essential,
distinguishing, characteristic(s) of the Objectivist view as against any
other view.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that Ayn Rand were to have gone through some
philosophical progression, like many other philosophers have. Perhaps
the early Rand comes up with Objectivism as we all know and love, but
then at a later point, completely renounces this philosophy and comes up
with something entirely different. Both of these philosophies would
surely be borne from Rand, and yet they are clearly different and
require different names. We find that the fact that Rand came up with an
idea is not the <em>essence</em> of that idea.</p>
<p>The other sort of definition that the typical Randian will reach for
consists of listing off the different branches of philosophy and briefly
explaining the Objectivist position on each. Again, this is not the
proper way to construct a definition. Nowhere else do we define
something by listing off a number of attributes that it has. Man is the
rational animal, not the animal that is in the genus homo with two arms
and two legs, and ears and a nose, and mostly hairless skin with a
certain amount of collagen and melanin and so on and so forth.
Similarly, Objectivism is not <em>defined</em> as the philosophy that
says such and such on metaphysics, and this other thing on epistemology,
and also here’s the aesthetic theory, and the meta-ethical viewpoint
etc. Objectivism is the philosophy of the primacy of existence. When we
are looking for a definition of a <em>philosophy</em>, we are looking
for what is distinctive to that philosophy, and thus how it approaches
each of the branches. No abstraction can be properly defined by listing
off each and every particular to which it applies—that is the nominalist
approach to definition. So Objectivism as a philosophy which is the
broader abstraction beyond each individual branch is not defined in
terms of listing off what it says on each branch.</p>
<p>This sort of listing-definition is borne from a parrotting of Rand.
These Randians will watch an Ayn Rand interview where she is asked to
<em>explain</em> Objectivism, and will see that she goes over each of
the branches giving a brief overview of the Objectivist position on
them. “Explain” is the key word here. Ayn Rand is not defining
Objectivism in terms of the branches, she is trying to explain what it
means in language that will be understood by the layman. A layman will
not understand what it means to say that Objectivism is the philosophy
of the primacy of existence, they have a far better chance at
understanding what she is getting across if she gives an explanation,
rather than a definition.</p>
<p>It is also not at all idiosyncratic of me to separate the philosophy
from the philosopher who originated it. The arch-closed-Objectivist,
Leonard Peikoff, does this very thing with respect to Aristotle. Peikoff
tells us in his history of philosophy that Aristotle the man had both
Platonist and Aristotelian elements in
him.<sup><a id="fnr.50" class="footref" href="#fn.50" role="doc-backlink">50</a></sup>
This simply could not be the case if Aristotelian meant whatever beliefs
in philosophy Aristotle held, much like the closed Objectivists want to
have for Rand. Indeed, Peikoff is entirely correct to conceptually
separate the <em>essential</em> approach that Aristotle
performed<sup><a id="fnr.51" class="footref" href="#fn.51" role="doc-backlink">51</a></sup>
from whatever remote deviations he may have had. As far as the history
of philosophy is concerned, any such deviation is simply irrelevant, and
will quickly be ironed over by more consistent students of the
philosopher who did the deviation. What matters in the definition of
philosophies is an identification of their essence—and that essence has
nothing to do, conceptually speaking, with the person who discovered or
invented the philosophy.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rand herself rejected the term “Randism” as a description of
her philosophy, correcting Mike Wallace that she calls it Objectivism
“meaning a philosophy based on objective
reality.”<sup><a id="fnr.52" class="footref" href="#fn.52" role="doc-backlink">52</a></sup></p>
<p>So, then, is it possible to make such simple statements of other
philosophies like my one for Objectivism? Perhaps, or perhaps not. I
will leave it to the adherents of Kant, or Descartes, or Saint Augustine
to distil such beliefs into an easily recognisable essence. I will say
on this front that most philosophies except for Objectivism form an
ecclectic hodge-podge of random positions hastily strung together, and
that to whatever extent this is the case one requires more
clarifications and asterisks to be stuck onto an otherwise neat
statement of that philosophy. When it comes to some of the more
ecclectic philosophies, it becomes possible to identify it only by
gesturing at the philosopher who thought it made sense. But, insofar as
a given philosophy is integrated in its claims and basic approach, one
can identify it as easily as I identify Objectivism: the philosophy of
the primacy of existence.</p>
<p>Of course, I would be remiss if I did not present some of the
arguments provided by the closed Objectivists on why they think it is
closed. Onkar Ghate has it that this is the normal way of thinking of
theories elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So there’s Darwin’s theories in evolutionary biology, and they’re
Darwin’s theories, and they end when he stops writing and dies. Then
those are his theories in biology. Or Einstein’s theories in physics.
They’re closed, again, when he dies or stops writing. And that was the
perspective that ARI adopted and its a perspective I certainly agree
with. But if you ask: is philosophy open or closed? I think it’s a
different answer. Philosophy is open. So Objectivism and […] truths in
philosophy are not
synonyms.<sup><a id="fnr.53" class="footref" href="#fn.53" role="doc-backlink">53</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to further address the “Objectivism is truths in
philosophy” type of open Objectivism, which I agree with him on. What I
disagree with him on, is his attempted analogising of Rand to Darwin and
Einstein. Notice that he said “Darwin’s theories in biology” and
“Einstein’s theories in physics” rather than “evolution” or “general
relativity.” Because the theories of evolution and general relativity
are decidedly <em>not</em> closed upon the deaths of their originators.
We know <em>for sure</em> that further discoveries need to be made in
the theory of general relativity, because it cannot account for quantum
gravity or dark matter. It is also possible to make further discoveries
under the broad umbrella of the theory of evolution, but I know far less
about biology so I cannot say exactly what that would consist of.
Indeed, nobody is debating over whether “Ayn Rand’s theories in
philosophy” is open or closed—clearly, whatever beliefs Ayn Rand holds
on philosophy is a closed set the instant she dies. But the word
“Objectivism”–much like the words “evolution” and “general
relativity”–does not refer to whatever beliefs she happens to hold. It
refers to the essential theory that she was forwarding.</p>
<p>The theories of evolution and general relativity are not terms
analogous to “philosophy”–the proper analogy there would be “biology”
and “physics”–evolution and general relativity, on the other hand, are
specific theories in their respective fields, like how Objectivism is a
specific theory about philosophy.</p>
<p>I will cap off this section with Rand’s nascent words on the
topic—which to be clear were written before this particular debate
occurred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is to say that I approve of the publication of <em>The
Objectivist Forum</em>, that it promises to be a very interesting
magazine, and that I recommend it to your attention. It is not, however,
the official voice of Objectivism and it is not my representative or
spokesman.</p>
<p>As its name indicates, this magazine is a <em>forum</em> for students
of Objectivism to discuss their ideas, each speaking only for
himself.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>If you wonder why I am so particular about protecting the integrity
of the term “Objectivism,” my reason is that “Objectivism” is the name I
have given to <em>my</em> philosophy — therefore, anyone using that name
for some philosophical hodgepodge of his own, without my knowledge or
consent, is guilty of the fraudulent presumption of trying to put
thoughts into <em>my</em> brain (or of trying to pass his thinking off
as mine — an attempt which fails, for obvious reasons). I chose the name
“Objectivism” at a time when my philosophy was beginning to be known and
some people were starting to call themselves “Randists.” I am much too
conceited to allow such a use of my name.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>What is the proper policy on this issue? If you agree with some
tenets of Objectivism, but disagree with others, do not call yourself an
Objectivist; give proper authorship credit for the parts you agree with
— and then indulge in any flights of fancy you wish, on your
own.<sup><a id="fnr.54" class="footref" href="#fn.54" role="doc-backlink">54</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quoted text was specifically selected by Onkar Ghate, before
anybody tries accusing me of omitting important information. Regardless,
I do agree with the closed Objectivists that this is evidence that Rand
would have been a closed Objectivist if she were alive for the debates.
But, that Ayn Rand would take that position does not imply that it is
the correct position. “Ayn Rand said so” isn’t an argument. At least the
open Objectivism that I present is not a philosophical hodgepodge—it is
the properly integrated form of the theory. And I am making no attempts
to represent any discoveries I have made as being discoveries made by
Ayn Rand, she deserves no credit for the numerous innovations in legal
theory I have made. This is precisely because <em>Objectivism does not
mean whatever beliefs in philosophy Ayn Rand held</em>. <em>Because</em>
I hold that Objectivism is a broader abstraction, I am perfectly free to
hold both that there are correct Objectivist stances that Ayn Rand did
not hold <em>whilst</em> not pinning these positions onto Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>I give proper credit for the discovery of the correct legal theory
<em>on Objectivist terms</em> to Murray Rothbard, and then to myself and
other contributors for completing it. <em>This does not require that
Objectivism means whatever beliefs in philosophy Ayn Rand held</em>.</p>
<h2 id="law-vs-politics">Law vs Politics</h2>
<p>So then, why is it that I think the anarcho-capitalist legal theory
as formulated by myself is the proper implication of prior Objectivist
philosophy? The reason is that I think Ayn Rand and her legion followers
were all answering the wrong question when it came time to formulate the
politics. Namely: I think politics is not a valid field of
philosophy—law is.</p>
<p>Peikoff states the question that politics is trying to answer as:
“what is right or wrong in terms of what the government does, what
society
does,”<sup><a id="fnr.55" class="footref" href="#fn.55" role="doc-backlink">55</a></sup>
or that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Politics, like ethics, is a normative branch of philosophy. Politics
defines the principles of a proper social system, including the proper
functions of
government.<sup><a id="fnr.56" class="footref" href="#fn.56" role="doc-backlink">56</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, once again, the fallacy of the frozen abstraction. Allow me
to highlight this with respect to another example from Rand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objectivists will often hear a question such as: “What will be done
about the poor or the handicapped in a free society?” […] Observe that
he does not ask: “Should anything be done?” but: “What will be done?”—as
if the collectivist premise had been tacitly accepted and all that
remains is a discussion of the means to implement
it.<sup><a id="fnr.57" class="footref" href="#fn.57" role="doc-backlink">57</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of politics, the Randians have grafted the premise that
there should be a government onto the very problem-statement. This
poisons every piece of analysis they provide from this point on. Their
formulation doesn’t even consider the question “should there be a
government?” it asks “how should the government be run?”</p>
<p>This snuck premise is a collectivist deviation. “Society” or “the
government” cannot do right or wrong—those are collective terms. Rand
and all of her followers on this front reify “society” as something that
can be good or bad, proper or improper. But society is not an entity, it
cannot act. We might as well make a new branch of philosophy called
murderology, which asks the question: “how should men act, including
what are the proper methods of murder? Murder is a value to men only if
it is the right kind of murder, after all!” This is a gross deviation
not only from the proper Objectivist line, but from philosophy itself.
None of the other branches are defined in such a crude fashion.</p>
<p>Metaphysics isn’t “what is there, and also what is the world stuff?,”
epistemology isn’t “how do I know and also why are the senses invalid?,”
and ethics isn’t “what should I do about it, and what are therefore my
duties?” So then why on Earth should one accept such sloppy grafting on
of a specific theory in Politics–that there should be a government–to
the broader abstraction of politics itself? Say, I think theres a term
for doing that. The fallacy of making cold abstractions? Something like
that.</p>
<p>Just as it is collectivist to speculate on what “society” should do
for the poor, it is collectivist to speculate on what “society” should
do for those whose rights are being violated. The proper response, in
both cases, is: “if you want to do something about it, then do it—I am
not my brothers keepers!”</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-the-nap-on-objectivist-grounds">Proof of The NAP on
Objectivist Grounds</h2>
<h3 id="the-correct-question-law">The Correct Question: Law</h3>
<p>The Objectivists do present various arguments against anarchism, but
before I address those I will give you my case for what should go in
place of the Randian politics.</p>
<p>We have seen that the error made by Rand and others on this front was
in answering the wrong question, so what is the right question? What is
the problem that men face that requires an answer from philosophy? The
problem is that we live in a world of scarce means, and as such men can
come into conflict with each other—so how should you deal with
conflicts? This is the question that law poses.</p>
<p>A conflict in this context does not mean a mere disagreement, or
argument, or dispute; a conflict means mutually-exclusive actions. So,
perhaps Robinson Crusoe is on a desert island and comes across a stick
in nature. He takes this stick and wishes to use it for spearfishing. As
he is on his way to the ocean, another man, Friday, sees this same stick
and decides to use it to stoke his fire. The two men cannot both perform
these actions at the same time–they are mutually exclusive–such that if
Friday went ahead with his course of action, there would be a conflict
and one man would have to be deprived of the attainment of his end.</p>
<p>Notice that nowhere in the formulation of this problem have any
additional unchecked premises been introduced. It is true that means are
scarce and therefore conflicts are possible. And it is true that this is
a problem that ethics can answer—namely, it answers it on the individual
level. Should you initiate conflicts, or not?</p>
<p>There are three basic answers to this question:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the law of the jungle—initiate conflicts at your whim;</li>
<li>mixed law—sometimes initiate conflicts, and;</li>
<li>the non-aggression principle—don’t initiate conflicts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-law-of-the-jungle">The Law of the Jungle</h3>
<p>First let’s consider the law of the jungle—what would a universal
acceptance of conflict-engendering norms look like? If Crusoe were to
take a stick from nature and try to use it for spearfishing, he would
not be able to complain under this system if Friday came along and took
that stick from him, because Crusoe could not claim the stick as his
<em>property</em>, the property right would rather travel from person to
person always being attached to the item itself. In other words, on such
a view there would be no distinction whatsoever between
<em>ownership</em> and <em>possession</em>. We would have–in the words
of Stephan
Kinsella<sup><a id="fnr.58" class="footref" href="#fn.58" role="doc-backlink">58</a></sup>–a
“mere possessor” ethic.</p>
<p>The issue with this view is that ownership–which we can define as the
<em>right</em> to possess a given scarce good–is necessarily distinct
from possession. If there is some dispute between <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> over who should be the one to
control a given property, then <em>both</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> must pre-suppose this to be the
case. <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is asserting that
though <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> might be able to
actually obtain control, it would nevertheless be the case that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> <em>should</em> be the one to
control it, and similarly <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is
asserting that though <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> might
be able to actually obtain control, it would nevertheless be the case
that <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> should be the one to
actually control it.</p>
<p>So this mere possessor ethic, which the law of the jungle asserts,
would require a conflation of the concepts <em>ownership</em> and
<em>possession</em>, that is to say that the law of the jungle is the
assertion that ownership rights are acquired by the mere act of taking a
given good from someone else—if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has a stick and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> takes that stick from him, then
the jungle-jurist says that <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>
could come along and take the stick from <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> and then become the owner,
i.e. that whomever is in possession of the stick is in fact it’s owner.
But, how exactly is a person able to assert this jungle-law view in
defense of their actions? We saw above that both <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> must pre-suppose the distinction
between ownership and possession—they are saying that <em>they</em>
should control the item which implies that they have a <em>right</em> to
exclude other people from using
it.<sup><a id="fnr.59" class="footref" href="#fn.59" role="doc-backlink">59</a></sup></p>
<p>We have this real problem of conflicts that we are trying to resolve
and the jungle law view is simply incommunicable by the fact that it is
a contradiction to even assert—the instant a man tries to defend his
conduct by asserting that conflicts should not be avoided and that
rights are illusory he necessarily asserts that conflicts should be
avoided (when initiated against him) and that rights are real (when the
thief is facing a
counter-attack).<sup><a id="fnr.60" class="footref" href="#fn.60" role="doc-backlink">60</a></sup>
So this man would be left with only the option of sealing up his lips
and making no defense, living as an animal-beast ruled by whatever whims
he feels at the moment, with no concern for whether his conduct is
rationally defensible.</p>
<p>So at best the jungle-law ethic reduces into whim-worship, but recall
above that ethics itself rests upon earlier conclusions in metaphysics
and epistemology, so upon what metaphysical and/or epistemic premises
does such an ethic rest? Fundamentally, we have the question of “how
should we be dealing with conflicts, what is criminal?” and the
jungle-jurist asserts: “who gives a damn? Might makes right; live by
your arbitrary whims.” What this means, if taken as a serious ethical
proposal, is that whims are a genuine source of knowledge, i.e. this is
not only a whim-ethic, but a whim-epistemology—it all boils down to “I
think this is true because I feel like it is;” “I should take this spear
because I feel like I should.”</p>
<p>But of course, epistemology does not stand on it’s own, it is not
primary in philosophy; rather a given epistemology rests on prior
metaphysical premises. So on what metaphysical premises does this
whim-epistemology rest? What is really being said here is that if you
simply <em>think</em> something to be the case hard enough then it
<em>is</em> the case; that your whims, your thoughts, your consciousness
is the basis of reality. That existence conforms to your consciousness,
rather than the other way around. This is the fallacy of the primacy of
consciousness. This view of the law of the jungle or any other
whim-based theory does and must rely on the premise that
consciousness–mere thoughts–have metaphysical primacy over
existence.</p>
<h3 id="mixed-law">Mixed Law</h3>
<h4 id="reduction-to-the-primacy-of-consciousness">Reduction to the
Primacy of Consciousness</h4>
<p>Next, let’s consider the “mixed law” system(s); i.e. that conflicts
should be avoided under certain circumstances, but not always. First any
mixed-law system that can be reduced to “we must aggress in these
arbitrary situations” is refuted by the above reasoning against the law
of the jungle.</p>
<p>Allow me to now quickly introduce a number of different proposals for
a mixed-law system such that I may draw your attention to a common
principle among them all:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>consequentialism—he whose victory would yield the best outcome is he
who should win the conflict at
hand;<sup><a id="fnr.61" class="footref" href="#fn.61" role="doc-backlink">61</a></sup></li>
<li>racism—he who is fighting for the interests of the preferred race is
he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>Marxism—he who is fighting for the interests of the proletariat is
he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>primitivism—he who is fighting for

is he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>monarchism—he who is deemed to be the proper victor by the monarch
is he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>democratism—he who is deemed to be the proper victor by majority
opinion is he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>Rawlsianism—he who is deemed to be the proper victor by a party
situated behind a veil of ignorance is he who should win the conflict at
hand,<sup><a id="fnr.63" class="footref" href="#fn.63" role="doc-backlink">63</a></sup>
and;</li>
<li>imperialism—he who is deemed to be an ally by the military
leadership of the preferred country is he who should win the conflict at
hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will notice that on their face these ideologies fall under two
categories: (1) the class-based, i.e. “he who is part of the preferred
class is he who should win the conflict at
hand,”<sup><a id="fnr.64" class="footref" href="#fn.64" role="doc-backlink">64</a></sup>
and (2) the whim-based, i.e. “he who is deemed to be the proper victor
by X is he who should win the conflict at hand.” It should be clear why
the latter would fall under the same reasoning as used against the law
of the jungle; thus I shall focus my efforts on those class-based
mixed-law systems.</p>
<p>Any form of class-based law is an ethic in the form: one rule for
class <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and another for class
non-<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. But by what possible
means could one derive that one ethic applies to <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and another
<em>incompatible</em><sup><a id="fnr.65" class="footref" href="#fn.65" role="doc-backlink">65</a></sup>
ethic applies to non-<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>? Surely
such an ethic could not be derived from the nature of man as such,
because if it were then we would have a universal principle, not one
that applies only to a particular subset of humanity. Therefore, such an
ethic must be arbitrarily particularised—we have an arbitrary
distinction which forms a class of humans and a class of sub-humans, we
do not here have a rational ethic for <em>man</em>. This
particularisation then falls back into the primacy of consciousness and
therefore fails.</p>
<h4 id="the-argument-from-argument">The Argument from Argument</h4>
<p>On top of this, there exists a built-in self-destruct for any mixed
law ethic, in the form of Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s argument from
argument.<sup><a id="fnr.66" class="footref" href="#fn.66" role="doc-backlink">66</a></sup></p>
<p>The basic idea behind this attack is found in noticing that there
exists an inescapable inconsistency when it comes to arguing in favour
of aggression, borne from the fact that argumentation is and must be a
conflict-free interaction. When people have some dispute and they choose
to argue about it, they are doing the exact opposite of fighting over
the dispute. That is, if Crusoe and Friday have a disagreement over how
to use a spear, then each party sitting down and giving arguments as to
why their use should go forth is quite distinct to each party launching
missiles and trying to stab the other to death in order that their use
may go forth unimpeded.</p>
<p>That is, simply by arguing about property rights, you must
pre-suppose libertarian non-aggression in your act of peacefully
attempting to resolve the disagreement. For our above dispute between
Crusoe and Friday, if Friday is trying to convince Crusoe that the
proper use of the spear is to violate Crusoe’s bodily autonomy, then he
finds himself in a practical
contradiction,<sup><a id="fnr.67" class="footref" href="#fn.67" role="doc-backlink">67</a></sup>
namely he is respecting Crusoe’s bodily autonomy and trying to achieve
consent from Crusoe by his act of arguing, whilst he is explicitly
rejecting that Crusoe’s consent is required in the first place. To
escape this contradiction, Friday has two options: first, he can stop
arguing and go back to fighting over it, or second, he can drop his
claim that Crusoe’s bodily autonomy should be violated. In this second
case the mixed law or jungle ethic has trivially dropped out of rational
consideration, and in the first case we have it that Friday has turned
himself into an animal-beast governed only by whim—which makes his ethic
irrational still.</p>
<p>What this argument does is highlight an implicit notion we have that
such jungle ethics are irrational and brutish; namely that it is simply
inconsistent and hypocritical for a person to even try to assert them in
an argument—that if they truly believe in their murderous creeds then
why the hell aren’t they living by them?</p>
<h3 id="virtue-vs-crime">Virtue vs Crime</h3>
<p>There is a certain subtle poison to address here that I have
encountered more heavily since the initial writing of this script. I
should note that I am indebted in my analysis here to Gee from
Proheretics<sup><a id="fnr.68" class="footref" href="#fn.68" role="doc-backlink">68</a></sup>
and Harry Binswanger—though the latter would almost certainly denounce
this entire video.</p>
<p>I am writing this section and including it after I have already began
editing because I believe it has to be included. Namely, the claim that
the non-aggression principle no longer applies in so-called “emergency
circumstances,” or those that are “metaphysically abnormal;” concretised
as “the lifeboat scenario.”</p>
<p>The situation is: there is only one spot left on a lifeboat, and two
people are there who need it. The claim is that it is right for both men
to aggress against the other in order to take the spot as his own.
Immediately there is a problem. How the hell did we get here? How did
each man find himself in this situation and why am I to believe that
both were acting entirely morally up to this point? Ethics does not
properly answer how to act in a single snapshot of your life, completely
disconnected and disintegrated from the whole—because life itself is not
a series of disconnected snapshots.</p>
<p>To explicate this problem, consider a different scenario that I have
been given on this point. An asteroid is hurtling towards Earth, and it
has a great enough mass to kill billions of people. A scientist had
previously constructed a laser gun that is capable of destroying this
asteroid, but he refuses to use it. Would it be moral to steal this
laser gun to save humanity? Notice the framing here: we have an
individual who is clearly more intelligent than the idiot masses and was
able to foresee the eventuality of asteroid strikes and was able to
create the means to stop them and we are supposed to side with the idiot
masses. Rather: we are supposed to imagine ourselves in their shoes.
“You are an idiot who cannot be expected to not bumble your way into
disaster, after all; so you should support destroying the man who
isn’t.”</p>
<p>For any who have read Atlas Shrugged, it should be clear what the
counterfactual framing is: that Prometheus who stole the fire of the
Gods is the one who should be emulated. And that he should not grant his
fire to those who would set eagles to tear out his liver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Rearden, […] if you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on
his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood running down his chest,
his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the
world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort
the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders—what would you tell
him to do?”</p>
<p>“I … don’t know. What … could he do? What would you tell him?”</p>
<p>“To
shrug.”<sup><a id="fnr.69" class="footref" href="#fn.69" role="doc-backlink">69</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the problem with their implicit framing of the hypotheticals
as a single snapshot in time—an ethical cold-open, where the previous
actions cannot be analysed. They assume that man is impotent as such,
and cannot possibly forsee potential threats to his life. This impotence
is then used as a justification of crime. Hypotheticals are not tools to
discover new philosophy; they have their place, but that is not it. In
any instance where a moron has stumbled his way into an emergency
scenario, the immoral act has already occurred by his negligence in
getting there in the first place. If I am beset by an angry mob trying
to kill me, it is a valid question to ask of me: how did I get here? Are
the mob trying to kill me because I previously went on a mass-murder
spree? If that is so, is it moral for me to continue the spree to
survive?</p>
<p>This is the second problem: the notion that survival is the sole
ethical goal of man. This relies on the premise that death is the
standard of value, as against life. Survival just means avoidance of
death, but death means non-existence for the living being. When one
abstracts away all the particular details inherent in life, they come to
the concept of death. So a null–a nothing–a zero–is being used as a
guide for the something–the thing–the life. This is the fallacy of
reification–literally “thing-making”–a nothing is being treated as a
something. Death is not something that one can achieve—at the moment of
death, there is no “one” to speak of. Death is the end, the boundary,
the non-existent as far as ethics and philosophy itself is concerned. No
man can possibly have philosophy be his guide when certain death faces
him. To ask what ethics has to say on a scenario where a man is moments
away from death is just as valid to ask of the epistemologist how man
can possibly gain any knowledge as he is enveloped by the explosion from
a nuclear bomb. That man cannot gain knowledge here, does nothing to
refute epistemology or ethics.</p>
<p>This is the same as the error implicit in Cartesian doubt. Descartes
tells us that the correct way to obtain knowledge is to first doubt
everything. I.e. take ignorance, falsehood, error as the primary, and
from there attempt to get to knowledge, truth, understanding. Error
refers to any deviation from truth, thus it cannot come <em>before</em>
truth. Descartes steals the concept of error. For the same reason, death
cannot act as a standard of value. Value is that which man acts to gain
and/or keep—you cannot gain or keep death. Death is the negation of
existence for the living being, nothing is not something, something must
be the standard, not the negation of something. So just as ignorance is
not the standard of knowledge, death is not the standard of life.</p>
<p>In these scenarios we are presented with two choices: either commit
aggression against someone, or die. They treat “death” as if it is an
action one can take. It is not. Ethics guides man on what
<em>actions</em> he should take <em>given the context of his life as an
integrated whole</em>. It tells man that given he has a certain nature,
certain actions are proper to him. Death is not an action. It is the end
of action. We have again the reification of a zero.</p>
<p>This framing of ethics as guiding man on what to do given the context
of his life leads us to our third problem with the framing given by the
NAP-exceptionists. Namely, a misunderstanding of what “context” means as
applied to ethics. The context of ethics is that you are a volitional
being—i.e. a lifeform capable of making choices. Ethics goes out of
context if and only if you can no longer make choices. That is the
situation when you can no longer count on ethics–or even philosophy–to
guide you. Because a guide is specifically a guide to action—a guide to
choice. We are not outside of the context of ethics just because things
are really scary or really dangerous—this is precisely the moment when
ethics is particularly important. It is far less urgent that one recall
his principles when selecting which flavour of ice cream he should buy
or which colour he should paint his wall than when he is in a life or
death scenario.</p>
<p>This is the fourth key point: what it means to say that something is
a <em>principle</em>. As Binswanger states it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A principle identifies an action that is required by the facts at
hand. To violate a principle is to act as if what is required were not
required—a contradiction. The oft-heard excuse “Just this once” means:
“It’s safe to accept just this one contradiction.” But accepting a
contradiction undercuts the whole structure of one’s knowledge. It
forces a puzzle-piece into a space it does not fit, spoiling the overall
picture (and leaving no place to put the right
piece).<sup><a id="fnr.70" class="footref" href="#fn.70" role="doc-backlink">70</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as epistemic principles are what man uses for his act of
validation and thus the identification of facts, ethical principles are
what man uses for his identification of values. You cannot drop ethical
principles “just this once” or “just in emergencies” in order to gain
values—you need those very principles to identify values in the first
place. Your ethical principles are the very framework, the structure, of
your hierarchy of values. It is literally impossible to identify and
integrate new values if you are not operating on principle. The instant
you drop the principle, you are disintegrating the entire apparatus
necessary to seek and maintain objective values.</p>
<p>The contradiction involved redounds on the total; life becomes
disintegrated on the Heraclitian premise that we are in total flux left
to be guided only by negation. If I am building a very complex bridge
and just cannot for the life of me work out how to make the thing work
given the materials currently available. It is not proper for me to
decide that just this once I will violate the principle that knowledge
can be gained only by looking outwards, instead deciding I will try to
contact the Platonic Form of Bridge and build based on that. If I do
this, the bridge will collapse, and hopefully nobody is around when it
happens.</p>
<p>The goal of ethics is to tell man how to live the good life. How to
flourish. Not how to live the long life. To sacrifice the good life at
the altar of the long life is to sacrifice life for death; to substitute
the sacred for the profane.</p>
<p>To be sure, the fact of death is important for ethics, but not
because it is the standard. Rather, death highlights why we
<em>need</em> a standard in the first place. It is because you are faced
with the inevitability of death that you must know how to live.
“Inevitability” is the key word here: if ethics were truly answering the
question of survival, then it would be a completely failed pursuit.
Every man will die. Thus on death-as-the-standard ethics; every man is
cursed with the original sin: he becomes more and more evil as he walks
towards the grave—desperately clamouring onto sustenance as he is slowly
doomed to be an eternal Satan as the Platonic form of Misery. That is:
the dead man is reified as the evil man, the mystic incarnation of
Death. Every man is pre-determined towards this most horrid outcome.
Survivalism, then, is the coating of religious afterlife myths in the
language of Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>All of this gives license for epistemic negligence. The practical
implication, is that man turns off his mind, and does not look into his
available options. The second he is beset by danger, he quietly says to
himself that this must be one of those emergency scenarios, and he does
not bother to look for a way out. Instead, he becomes a parasite, and
feasts upon the flesh of the men who did find the way out. Further: how
exactly is a man to ever identify that he is in a situation where he
must aggress? What is his guiding ethical principle in the situation
where ethical principles no longer apply? Is man required to be
omniscient in order to foresee all of the possibilities in a situation
that was apparently unforseeable?</p>
<p>In emergencies, one is never actually presented with two options.
There are innumerable different options to exhaust, none of which will
be attempted if one is guided by the cowardly premise that survival is
all that matters. After all, what lowlife criminal has not used the
excuse that they simply had no choice but to aggress? Perhaps they had a
bad upbringing, or they suffered poor socioeconomic circumstances, or
they were being exploited by the capitalists. These are all wolves’
tears, and should be discarded as such.</p>
<p>I do not buy any of these claims from people that there is just no
possible way for them to survive without becoming parasites. These
claims strike me as those that could be made by the many moochers
present in Ayn Rand’s fiction. Take Hugh Glass as the paradigm example.
He was enslaved to a group of pirates and was able to escape with one
other gentleman. The two men found themselves in the cannibal Pawnee
territory, with no map, and severely limited provisions. They were
captured by the cannibals, and Hugh was forced to watch as his companion
was burned alive. Before they took his life, he was able to negotiate
for his safety by trading exotic pigments that could be used as war
paint. After being let go, Hugh would go into the fur trade, and would
join a fur-trading expedition that was almost entirely wiped out by the
Ree Indians. After this, he encountered a grizzly bear, which proceeded
to begin tearing his flesh off and feeding him alive to her cubs.
Figuring that he was sure to die, his few remaining compatriots took all
of his supplies and left him for dead. He did not die. He woke up a few
days later. He found that he could no longer move an arm and a leg. He
crawled his way to collect supplies, still half-dead from the mauling.
He would sanitise his wounds using maggots from a rotting tree stump,
and after 6 months of slowly making his way down a 250 mile stretch of
the Yellowstone river, he finally found himself at Fort Kiowa, and was
able to make a recovery.</p>
<p>Was Hugh Glass in metaphysically abnormal circumstances? Was survival
impossible to him without aggression? Apparently not.</p>
<h2 id="the-objectivist-arguments-against-anarchism">The Objectivist
Arguments Against Anarchism</h2>
<p>So, we have it that there are three possible solutions to the correct
problem-statement of law, two of them are false, leaving us only with
the non-aggression principle as the correct answer. Refer to my course
on how the rest of the legal theory is derived from the
NAP,<sup><a id="fnr.71" class="footref" href="#fn.71" role="doc-backlink">71</a></sup>
and any Randroids in the audience who find themselves screaming about
rationalism because I used deductive reasoning can feel free to sob away
all they want—but if I can pierce the veil of tears for a moment, I
would ask them to articulate exactly what about my preceding reasoning
is incorrect, rather than just screaming about how Peikoff one time said
something that sort of sounds like what they want to say.</p>
<p>Regardless, I can now move onto some of the objections that the
Randians have raised against anarchism. Do note that this is one area
where the writing is laughably sparse, and for good reason—namely, they
lack any solid theoretical objections so prefer to give a very light
treatment to the topic and never with an anarcho-Objectivist there to
provide counter-arguments.</p>
<p>Rand defines government as “an institution that holds the exclusive
power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical
area,”<sup><a id="fnr.72" class="footref" href="#fn.72" role="doc-backlink">72</a></sup>
and on this definition, anarchism is supposed to represent a floating
abstraction—i.e. an abstraction with no concrete referent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction: for
all the reasons discussed above, a society without an organized
government would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along
and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the
possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy:
even a society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly
moral, could not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of
objective laws and of an arbiter for honest disagreements among men that
necessitates the establishment of a
government.<sup><a id="fnr.73" class="footref" href="#fn.73" role="doc-backlink">73</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, there is the false premise that without a monopoly on rights
enforcement all that is left is brute violence and gang warfare. As I
have explained earlier, competing insurance firms tend to do a far
better job at enforcing rights than any monopolist could hope to.
Second, there is the false premise that anarchy means no objective laws
or arbitration. This is a point that is frequently repeated by the
Randians, and never substantiated. It is the premise that you need some
monopolist to “make the law objective”—but law is <em>discovered</em>
not <em>produced</em>. Competing arbitration firms can all appeal to
reality to discover what the objective legal principles are which they
can then apply to some specific case. Honest disagreements can be
resolved without having a monopoly on dispute resolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A recent variant of anarchistic theory, which is befuddling some of
the younger advocates of freedom, is a weird absurdity called “competing
governments.” Accepting the basic premise of the modern statists – who
see no difference between the functions of government and the functions
of industry, between force and production, and who advocate government
ownership of business – the proponents of “competing governments” take
the other side of the same coin and declare that since competition is so
beneficial to business, it should also be applied to government. Instead
of a single, monopolistic government, they declare, there should be a
number of different governments in the same geographical area, competing
for the allegiance of individual citizens, with every citizen free to
“shop” and to patronize whatever government he chooses.</p>
<p>Remember that forcible restraint of men is the only service a
government has to offer. Ask yourself what a competition in forcible
restraint would have to
mean.<sup><a id="fnr.74" class="footref" href="#fn.74" role="doc-backlink">74</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if government means “an institution that holds the exclusive
power to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical
area,” then we have successfully defined away any “competing
governments” anarchism. But this does not begin to address the
anarcho-capitalist case. If government must mean a monopolist, then
competition in rights enforcement does not entail competing governments.
Competition in this arena means that you can pay whomever you like to
enforce your rights—nothing else. Rand continues with a hypothetical
scenario that is supposed to demonstrate the absurdity of competition in
rights enforcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] suppose Mr. Smith, a customer of Government A, suspects that his
next-door neighbor, Mr. Jones, a customer of Government B, has robbed
him; a squad of Police A proceeds to Mr. Jones’ house and is met at the
door by a squad of Police B, who declare that they do not accept the
validity of Mr. Smith’s complaint and do not recognize the authority of
Government A. What happens then? You take it from
there.<sup><a id="fnr.75" class="footref" href="#fn.75" role="doc-backlink">75</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How utterly absurd! I might as well dream up my own fantasy to
dispute this theory: what if instead of Government A and B, we had just
the one government; Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones each have their own friends
in the government. Then Smith tells his government friends that Jones
stole his wallet, and of course this must obviously lead to the great
war of the wallets! Millions die in the great and bloody war for power
until one side prevails and genocides those who assert the incorrect
view on whether the wallet was stolen or not.</p>
<p>What Rand forgets in her random hypothesizing, is that hypothetical
scenarios are not tools to discover philosophy. They have many brilliant
uses in checking that one is consistent or in trying to apply
philosophical principles to cleanly defined scenarios—but they cannot do
anything beyond this. What would <em>actually</em> happen in such a
scenario, is that neither <em>firm</em> wants to go to random war, so
they would investigate who the aggressor is and seek damages from him.
It is the state which is capable of externalising any costs of great
wars onto vast arrays of victims—not private firms.</p>
<p>Peikoff has his own retorts to anarchism, which stand as being just
as absurd as Rand’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anarchism is the idea that there should be no government. In
Objectivist terms, this amounts to the view that every man should defend
himself by using physical force against others whenever he feels like
it, with no objective standards of justice, crime, or
proof.<sup><a id="fnr.76" class="footref" href="#fn.76" role="doc-backlink">76</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a near-explicit straw man attack on anarchism. Anarchism is
the view that there should be no government–if government means a
monopoly force-user–but that does not even come close to implying “that
every man should defend himself by using physical force against others
whenever he feels like it, with no objective standards of justice,
crime, or proof.” What an absolutely absurd claim that is on its face. I
would be somewhat willing to excuse utter nonsense like this if it were
written in a time prior to Murray Rothbard, but it wasn’t—Peikoff is
just openly endorsing the false alternative that either there should be
a monopoly on force, or everyone should just use whatever force they
want at their whim. I’m frankly shocked that he never once considered
whether individual men could discover and apply philosophy on their own
when it comes to the question of when the use of force is licit. Peikoff
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What if an individual does not want to delegate his right of
self-defense?” the anarchist frequently asks. “Isn’t that a legitimate
aspect of ‘freedom’?” The question implies that a “free man” is one with
the right to enact his desire, any desire, simply because it is his
desire, including the desire to use force. This means the equation of
“freedom” with whim-worship. Philosophically, the underlying premise is
subjectivism (of the personal
variety).<sup><a id="fnr.77" class="footref" href="#fn.77" role="doc-backlink">77</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the underlying premise is decidedly <em>not</em> that a man
may do <em>anything</em> he wants simply because he wants it—the
underlying premise is that a man may defend himself if he wishes or
delegate this defense to anybody he sees fit. Nowhere in this claim is
there any implication that people may engage in random acts of violence
or use arbitrary means to defend their property. That is a patent
absurdity and false alternative presented to us by the people who are
supposed to have as their banner that they check premises and never
accept false alternatives.</p>
<p>The collectivist poison that Rand grafted onto her politics has
yielded legion derivative errors, not least of which is her support of
intellectual “property.” If you want to know why that is wrong, you have
to watch this

<p><sup><a id="fn.40" href="#fnr.40">40</a></sup> I take Hicks as the
“standard” case here for a few reasons. First he is recognised by the
Atlas Society as a “Senior Scholar,” and as such it seems perfectly
reasonable to assume that his view on open Objectivism would be
representative of the Atlas Society case for it (<a
href="https://www.atlassociety.org/staff-trustees-and-authors/stephen-hicks"
class="uri">https://www.atlassociety.org/staff-trustees-and-authors/stephen-hicks</a>).
Second, Hicks was able to get a debate with a believer in the closed
system, hailed as the first of it’s kind since Peikoff’s publishing of
<em>Fact and Value</em>. This provides an opportunity for me to learn of
the argument and any counterarguments all in one place.</p>

<p><sup><a id="fn.59" href="#fnr.59">59</a></sup> Recall the point about
scarcity; if they have a right to control the item in question this

<p><sup><a id="fn.61" href="#fnr.61">61</a></sup> Utilitarianism would
be a sub-category, where “best outcome” means “the outcome of maximal
utility.” Utilitarianism specifically can be shown to be false on purely
economic grounds in its use of a category error with the determination
of the data type of “utility,” see: Kenneth A. Zahringer (2011),
“Cardinal Utility: It’s Worse Than You Thought,” <em>Mises Daily</em>,
or on philosophical grounds as with any parasitic ethics, see: Leonard
Peikoff’s history of modern philosophy.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.62" href="#fnr.62">62</a></sup> Apocalypse here is
meant as a break-down in the capital structure, which is what
primitivists such as Ted Kaczynski advocate for. For more on this see:
LiquidZulu, <em>Primitivism is an Apocalyptic Ideology</em>.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.63" href="#fnr.63">63</a></sup> For more on this in
particular see: Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Introduction to Murray Rothbard,
<em>The Ethics of Liberty</em>, second edition.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.64" href="#fnr.64">64</a></sup> This would include
1-4; consequentialism has the class of detrimental individuals as
against the class of beneficial individuals, primitivism has the class
of producers as against the class of anti-producers, racism and marxism
are obvious.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.65" href="#fnr.65">65</a></sup> If the ethics were
compatible this would then not be one rule for <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and another for non-<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, it would rather be the same
fundamental principle applying to both groups, and would therefore not
be a class-based ethic.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.66" href="#fnr.66">66</a></sup> On this, see:
Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “The Ethical Justification of Capitalism and Why
Socialism is Morally Indefensible,” in idem., <em>A Theory of Socialism
