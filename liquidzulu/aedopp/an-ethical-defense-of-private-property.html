<h1 id="the-problem-of-law">The Problem of Law</h1>
<p>Ethics is the science whose concern is the identification of those
principles which contrast right from wrong in the realm of human action.
Ethics–like all sciences–does not stand on it’s own—any given ethical
theory must rest upon the general theory of knowledge,
<em>epistemology</em>, and more fundamentally on the theory of the
nature of the universe as a whole, <em>metaphysics</em>. This section
will not be explaining ethical theory as such, rather the focus is
placed upon a specific subset of ethics called <em>law</em>.</p>
<p>To see the problem that law studies picture a desert island inhabited
by Crusoe and Friday. One day, Crusoe finds a branch poking out of a
tree that he expects would make for a perfect spear to fish with. Crusoe
takes this branch out of the tree, processes it into a spear, and heads
to the ocean to get his dinner. On his way there, however, Friday sees
this spear that Crusoe is carrying and imagines that it would suit him
in stoking his fire. Friday decides to try and take this spear from
Crusoe for this purpose.</p>
<p>What we notice in this scenario is that it is not possible for
<em>both</em> Crusoe <em>and</em> Friday to get what they want; if
Friday is able to successfully wrestle the stick from Crusoe then his
end is satisfied but the end of Crusoe is not, and vice versa for if
Crusoe can repel Friday’s attempts. In short, one mans action with the
spear excludes a whole host of alternative actions that other men may
wish to use the spear in. This is the economic principle of
<em>scarcity</em>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Given scarcity it is possible for men to come into conflicts, a
conflict being defined as mutually-exclusive actions. So, in the above
scenario when Friday decides to try and take the spear from Crusoe we
say that there is a conflict over that spear; one man’s use of the spear
excludes the other from using it—the actions are mutually-exclusive.
This is the issue that law studies, namely we have this problem of
conflicts that can arise due to the fact that goods are scarce, law
answers how we should deal with these conflicts.</p>
<p>There are three basic answers to this
question:<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>that conflicts should be avoided (the non-aggression
principle);</li>
<li>that conflicts should be avoided under certain circumstances, but
not always (mixed law), or;</li>
<li>that conflicts should not be avoided (the law of the jungle).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="an-analysis-of-competing-legal-theories">An Analysis of
Competing Legal Theories</h1>
<h2 id="the-law-of-the-jungle">The Law of the Jungle</h2>
<p>First let’s consider the law of the jungle—what would a universal
acceptance of conflict-engendering norms look like? If Crusoe were to
take a stick from nature and try to use it for spearfishing, he would
not be able to complain under this system if Friday came along and took
that stick from him, because Crusoe could not claim the stick as his
<em>property</em>, the property right would rather travel from person to
person always being attached to the item itself. In other words, on such
a view there would be no distinction whatsoever between
<em>ownership</em> and <em>possession</em>. We would have–in the words
of Stephan
Kinsella<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>–a
“mere possessor” ethic.</p>
<p>The issue with this view is that ownership–which we can define as the
<em>right</em> to possess a given scarce good–is necessarily distinct
from possession. If there is some dispute between <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> over who should be the one to
control a given property, then <em>both</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> must pre-suppose this to be the
case. <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is asserting that
though <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> might be able to
actually obtain control, it would nevertheless be the case that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> <em>should</em> be the one to
control it, and similarly <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is
asserting that though <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> might
be able to actually obtain control, it would nevertheless be the case
that <strong><em>B</em></strong> should be the one to actually control
it.</p>
<p>So this mere possessor ethic, which the law of the jungle asserts,
would require a conflation of the concepts <em>ownership</em> and
<em>possession</em>, that is to say that the law of the jungle is the
assertion that ownership rights are acquired by the mere act of taking a
given good from someone else—if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has a stick and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> takes that stick from him, then
the jungle-jurist says that <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>
could come along and take the stick from <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> and then become the owner,
i.e. that whomever is in possession of the stick is in fact it’s owner.
But, how exactly is a person to assert this jungle-law view in defense
of their actions? We saw above that both <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> must pre-suppose the distinction
between ownership and possession—they are saying that <em>they</em>
should control the item which implies that they have a <em>right</em> to
exclude other people from using
it.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
<p>We have this real problem of conflicts that we are trying to resolve
and the jungle law view is simply incommunicable by the fact that it is
a contradiction to even assert—the instant a man tries to defend his
conduct by asserting that conflicts should not be avoided and that
rights are illusory he necessarily asserts that conflicts should be
avoided (when initiated against him) and that rights are real (when the
thief is facing a
counter-attack).<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
So this man would be left with only the option of sealing up his lips
and making no defense, living as an animal-beast ruled by whatever whims
he feels at the moment, with no concern for whether his conduct is
rationally defensible.</p>
<p>So at best the jungle-law ethic reduces into whim-worship, but recall
above that ethics itself rests upon earlier conclusions in metaphysics
and epistemology, so upon what metaphysical and/or epistemic premises
does such an ethic rest? Fundamentally, we have the question of “how
should we be dealing with conflicts, what is criminal?” and the
jungle-jurist asserts: “who gives a damn? Might makes right; live by
your arbitrary whims.” What this means, if taken as a serious ethical
proposal, is that whims are a genuine source of knowledge, i.e. this is
not only a whim-ethic, but a whim-epistemology—it all boils down to “I
think this is true because I feel like it is;” “I should take this spear
because I feel like I should.”</p>
<p>But of course, epistemology does not stand on it’s own, it is not
primary in philosophy; rather a given epistemology rests on prior
metaphysical premises. So on what metaphysical premises does this
whim-epistemology rest? What is really being said here is that if you
simply <em>think</em> something to be the case hard enough then it
<em>is</em> the case; that your whims, your thoughts, your consciousness
is the basis of reality. That existence conforms to your consciousness,
rather than the other way around. This is the fallacy of the primacy of
consciousness. This view of the law of the jungle or any other
whim-based theory does and must rely on the premise that
consciousness–mere thoughts–have metaphysical primacy over
existence.</p>
<p>The reason that this view is fallacious and an inversion of the
correct way of doing things is that the concept of “consciousness”
<em>requires</em> a <em>prior</em> concept of <em>existence</em>. It is
simply meaningless to speak of <em>consciousness</em> as floating on its
own; to be <em>conscious</em> is to be conscious <em>of something</em>.
The whim-epistemologists steal the concept of consciousness. This is
akin to those who assert such things as “property is theft”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Theft” is a concept that logically and genetically depends on the
antecedent concept of “rightfully owned property”—and refers to the act
of taking that property without the owner’s consent. If no property is
rightfully owned, that is, if nothing is property, there can be no such
concept as “theft.” Thus, the statement “All property is theft” has an
internal contradiction: to use the concept “theft” while denying the
validity of the concept of “property,” is to use “theft” as a concept to
which one has no logical right—that is, as a stolen
concept.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to bring this into clarity with the case of our
whim-epistemologists, consciousness relies on the antecedent concept of
existence—there is no<em>thing</em> to be conscious <em>of</em> without
<em>things</em> existing in the first place. Therefore, this notion of a
law of the jungle wipes itself out—it is a self-defeating idea,
completely unworthy of any consideration at all.</p>
<h2 id="mixed-law">Mixed Law</h2>
<h3 id="reduction-to-the-primacy-of-consciousness">Reduction to The
Primacy of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Next, let’s consider the “mixed law” system(s); i.e. that conflicts
should be avoided under certain circumstances, but not always. First any
mixed-law system that can be reduced to “we must
aggress<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>
in these arbitrary situations” is refuted by the above reasoning against
the law of the jungle.</p>
<p>Allow me to now quickly introduce a number of different proposals for
a mixed-law system such that I may draw your attention to a common
principle among them all:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>consequentialism—he whose victory would yield the best outcome is he
who should win the conflict at
hand;<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup></li>
<li>racism—he who is fighting for the interests of the preferred race is
he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>Marxism—he who is fighting for the interests of the proletariat is
he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>primitivism—he who is fighting for
apocalypse<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
is he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>monarchism—he who is deemed to be the proper victor by the monarch
is he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>democratism—he who is deemed to be the proper victor by majority
opinion is he who should win the conflict at hand;</li>
<li>Rawlsianism—he who is deemed to be the proper victor by a party
situated behind a veil of ignorance is he who should win the conflict at
hand,<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>
and;</li>
<li>imperialism—he who is deemed to be an ally by the military
leadership of the preferred country is he who should win the conflict at
hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will notice that on their face these ideologies fall under two
categories: (1) the class-based, i.e. “he who is part of the preferred
class is he who should win the conflict at
hand,”<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>
and (2) the whim-based, i.e. “he who is deemed to be the proper victor
by X is he who should win the conflict at hand.” It should be clear why
the latter would fall under the same reasoning as used against the law
of the jungle; thus I shall focus my efforts on those class-based
mixed-law systems.</p>
<p>Any form of class-based law is an ethic in the form: one rule for
class <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and another for class
<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sup>∁</sup></span>.<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup>
But by what possible means could one derive that one ethic applies to
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and another
<em>incompatible</em><sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup>
ethic applies to <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sup>∁</sup></span>? Surely such an ethic
could not be derived from the nature of man as such, because if it were
then we would have a universal principle, not one that applies only to a
particular subset of humanity. Therefore, such an ethic must be
arbitrarily particularised—we have an arbitrary distinction which forms
a class of humans and a class of sub-humans, we do not here have a
rational ethic for <em>man</em>. This particularisation then falls back
into the primacy of consciousness and therefore fails.</p>
<p>However, the above reasoning is assuming that this individual accepts
the metaphysical equality of man, as without such an equality it would
not be the case that man as such has a particular nature which implies a
certain ethics but rather there might be a proletarian class with their
own proletarian logic as against a bourgeoisie class with their own
bourgeoisie logic. This is polylogist thesis, first identified by Ludwig
von Mises. Polylogism, therefore, must be analysed before we can
proceed. First, the polylogist requirement that different groups have
different logics rests upon the prior assumption that the laws of logic
are subjective, rather than
objective<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup>—that
logic is not imposed upon man as a necessary requirement of validating
his beliefs by the universe, but rather that man himself projects out
such rules onto the universe.</p>
<p>This is, again, primacy of consciousness—the starting point for the
polylogist is not an observation of reality and derivation therefrom,
but rather a deadly retreat into their own minds. When we have the
proper starting point of existence we have it that the very first thing
you can say metaphysically is that existence
exists.<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup>
<em>From this</em> we have it that we are conscious <em>of</em>
existence. And of course, to be conscious of existence means that you
are conscious of some<em>thing</em> that exists, implicit in this is the
law of identity: that which is is what it is, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If something <em>exists</em>, then <em>something</em> exists; and if
there is a <em>something</em>, then there <em>is</em> a
something.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-argument-from-argument">The Argument from Argument</h3>
<p>On top of this, there exists a built-in self-destruct for any mixed
law ethic, in the form of Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s argument from
argument.<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup>
The basic idea behind this attack is found in noticing that there exists
an inescapable inconsistency when it comes to arguing in favour of
aggression, borne from the fact that argumentation is and must be a
conflict-free interaction. When people have some dispute and they choose
to argue about it, they are doing the exact opposite of fighting over
the dispute. That is, if Crusoe and Friday have a disagreement over how
to use a spear, then each party sitting down and giving arguments as to
why their use should go forth is quite distinct to each party launching
missiles and trying to stab the other to death in order that their use
may go forth unimpeded.</p>
<p>That is, simply by arguing about property rights, you must
pre-suppose libertarian non-aggression in your act of peacefully
attempting to resolve the disagreement. For our above dispute between
Crusoe and Friday, if Friday is trying to convince Crusoe that the
proper use of the spear is to violate Crusoe’s bodily autonomy, then he
finds himself in a practical
contradiction,<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18" role="doc-backlink">18</a></sup>
namely he is respecting Crusoe’s bodily autonomy and trying to achieve
consent from Crusoe by his act of arguing, whilst he is explicitly
rejecting that Crusoe’s consent is required in the first place. To
escape this contradiction, Friday has two options: first, he can stop
arguing and go back to fighting over it, or second, he can drop his
claim that Crusoe’s bodily autonomy should be violated. In this second
case the mixed law or jungle ethic has trivially dropped out of rational
consideration, and in the first case we have it that Friday has turned
himself into an animal-beast governed only by whim—which makes his ethic
irrational still.</p>
<p>What this argument does is highlight an implicit notion we have that
such jungle ethics are irrational and brutish; namely that it is simply
inconsistent and hypocritical for a person to even try to assert them in
an argument—that if they truly believe in their murderous creeds then
why the hell aren’t they living by them? This is the same inconsistency
that is present in those anti-human environmentalists who advocate that
fewer humans be born because of how evil and destructive man is—the
proper course with such an individual is to point out that if they are
correct then they should simply kill themselves and reduce the problem
by
one.<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19" role="doc-backlink">19</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="private-property-anarchism">Private Property Anarchism</h2>
<p>So, we have it that of our alternative legal systems both the law of
the jungle and any sort of mixed law fall into complete irrationality,
leaving us with total adherence to the Non-Aggression Principle as the
only alternative. It is proper at this point for me to briefly indicate
the sort of legal theory that this implies, but as this is only a
<em>defense</em> of private property, I shall not exhaust said legal
theory.<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20" role="doc-backlink">20</a></sup></p>
<p>First, under this theory you will recall that property rights–that
is, rights of exclusive control over scarce resources–are not acquired
by arbitrary fiat whether divine, or social, or personal. Rather
property rights are acquired by a process of <em>homesteading</em>, that
is by taking up initial control over the good in question. In our case
of Crusoe taking the spear from nature prior to anyone else coming into
contact with it we saw that there is no conflict until the moment that
Friday attempts to re-possess Crusoe’s spear—taking things from nature
is a legitimate action. We saw that it is Friday who is committing the
crime, that is any latecomers to the spear cannot justifiably control
it, only the firstcomer–i.e. the homesteader–can, any latecomer is
initiating a conflict when they attempt to re-possess the good in
question.</p>
<p>We can move simply from this understanding of rational property
rights as conflict-avoiding norms that are obtained by the firstcomer
into an insight into the nature of a legitimate homesteading claim,
namely that the borders of said homesteaded property must be objective
and intersubjectively
ascertainable.<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21" role="doc-backlink">21</a></sup>
This fact becomes clear when we break it down into its constituent
parts: first, property borders must be objective—that is they must
adhere to existence as against the arbitrary content of ones
consciousness. This is simply another way of explaining that property
rights do not derive by fiat: arbitrary declarations as the basis of
property claims simply cannot avoid conflicts and such a fiat-law rests
on untenable metaphysical ground. We have it that a rational legal
system must be universal, not arbitrarily particularised, thus we cannot
have subjective property borders as subjective property borders may
freely contradict each other, leaving the theory in ruin.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to the criterion that property borders must be
intersubjectively ascertainable—what this means is that they are
“public” and can be seen or in some other way perceived by third
parties. The reason why rational property borders must be
intersubjectively ascertainable is that if they are not they cannot
serve to avoid conflicts, and property rights are conflict avoiding
norms. Consider a non-intersubjectively ascertainable property border
such as a mere verbal decree—Robinson Crusoe decides that he wants to
own the Moon so he simply shouts to the forest that he now owns the
Moon. Clearly this verbal decree cannot serve to avoid conflicts, when
an astronaut is approaching the Moon he has no means of discovering
Crusoe’s supposed property right in it, thus Crusoe has not actually
engaged in an act of homesteading—he has not erected an objective,
intersubjectively ascertainable border.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] no one could ever deny that norms for determining the ownership
of scarce goods are useful for allowing conflict-free exploitation of
such resources. But, as Hoppe points out, there are only two fundamental
alternatives for acquiring unowned property: (1) by doing something with
things with which no one else had ever done anything before, that is,
the Lockean concept of mixing of labour, or homesteading; or (2) simply
by verbal declaration or decree. However, a rule that allows property to
be owned by mere verbal declaration cannot serve to avoid conflicts,
since any number of people could at any time assert conflicting claims
of ownership of a particular scarce resource. Only the first
alternative, that of Lockean homesteading, establishes an objective […]
link between a particular person and a particular scarce resource, and
thus no one can deny the Lockean right to homestead unowned
resources.<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22" role="doc-backlink">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A further fundamental implication that must here be made explicit is
that these property rights are <em>exclusive</em> both in the sense that
they exclude
non-owners,<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23" role="doc-backlink">23</a></sup>
and also in the sense that they must be held <em>exclusively</em> by a
<em>single</em> person. That is, no rational theory of property rights
can include <em>group</em> or <em>collective</em> property rights, they
must be <em>private</em> property rights. Consider a set of people,
<span class="math inline">{<em>A</em>, ⋯, <em>Z</em>}</span>, who each
commonly own a stick. What is to be done about a conflict over the use
of this stick between <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>? There are two
possibilities, either <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is
said to be the just victor, or <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is. If <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, then he owns the stick and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> does not, if <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> then he owns the stick, and <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> does not. But both options
contradict the presumption that every member in the set owned the stick,
therefore group ownership simply cannot occur.</p>
<p>Allow me to go over some supposed solutions to this conundrum, the
first of which is the democratic one. Essentially, have all members
within the set vote to determine who the just victor is—still, any who
lost the vote did not own the stick, as their desired control was
considered unjust. Also consider the set which only consists of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, what vote could possibly be
conducted between these men which would not come out as <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> in favour of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> in favour of <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>? If <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> voted for <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or vice versa there would be no
conflict, and law studies only those set of situations where there is
conflict rather than those where men are in harmonious agreement about
how things should be done.</p>
<p>The next proposal for a solution comes from Roderick Long, he
sates:<sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24" role="doc-backlink">24</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the libertarian view, we have a right to the fruit of our labor,
and we also have a right to what people freely give us. Public property
can arise in both these ways.</p>
<p>Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to
walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community
it’s hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen
branches in the way. But over time, the way is cleared and a path
forms—not through any centrally coordinated effort, but simply as a
result of all the individuals walking that way day after day.</p>
<p>The cleared path is the product of labor—not any individual’s labor,
but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of
the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would
be violating the collective property right that the villagers together
have earned.</p>
<p>Public property can also be the product of gift. In 19th-century
England, it was common for roads to be built privately and then donated
to the public for free use. This was done not out of altruism but
because the roadbuilders owned land and businesses alongside the site of
the new road, and they knew that having a road there would increase the
value of their land and attract more customers to their businesses.
Thus, the unorganized public can legitimately come to own land, both
through original acquisition (the mixing of labor) and through voluntary
transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Long provides two cases that he sees as legitimate group property:
(1) where a group communally “mix their labour” with an object in
nature, and (2) where a man transfers ownership of his private property
to a group in common. The issue with (1) is that Long relies on the
faulty labour theory of property. It is not mixing labour with land
which imbues a man with ownership, as we have seen it is the nature of
scarcity giving rise to the potential for conflict which implies
property rights. To demonstrate the failure of this theory more
thorougly, allow me to quote Kinsella at
length:<sup><a id="fnr.25" class="footref" href="#fn.25" role="doc-backlink">25</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As noted before, some libertarian IP advocates, such as Rand, hold
that creation is the source of property rights. This confuses the nature
and reasons for property rights, which lie in the undeniable fact of
scarcity. Given scarcity and the correspondent possibility of conflict
in the use of resources, conflicts are avoided and peace and cooperation
are achieved by allocating property rights to such resources. And the
purpose of property rights dictates the nature of such rules. For if the
rules allocating property rights are to serve as objective rules that
all can agree upon so as to avoid conflict, they cannot be biased or
arbitrary. For this reason, unowned resources come to be
owned—homesteaded or appropriated—by the first possessor.</p>
<p>The general rule, then, is that ownership of a given scarce resource
can be identified by determining who first occupied it. There are
various ways to possess or occupy resources, and different ways to
demonstrate or prove such occupation, depending upon the nature of the
resource and the use to which it is put. Thus, I can pluck an apple from
the wild and thereby homestead it, or I can fence in a plot of land for
a farm. It is sometimes said that one form of occupation is “forming” or
“creating” the thing. For example, I can sculpt a statue from a block of
marble, or forge a sword from raw metal, or even “create” a farm on a
plot of land.</p>
<p>We can see from these examples that creation is relevant to the
question of ownership of a given “created” scarce resource, such as a
statue, sword, or farm, only to the extent that the act of creation is
an act of occupation, or is otherwise evidence of first occupation.
However, “creation” itself does not justify ownership in things; it is
neither necessary nor sufficient. One cannot create some possibly
disputed scarce resource without first using the raw materials used to
create the item. But these raw materials are scarce, and either I own
them or I do not. If not, then I do not own the resulting product. If I
own the inputs, then, by virtue of such ownership, I own the resulting
thing into which I transform them.</p>
<p>Consider the forging of a sword. If I own some raw metal (because I
mined it from ground I owned), then I own the same metal after I have
shaped it into a sword. I do not need to rely on the fact of creation to
own the sword, but only on my ownership of the factors used to make the
sword. And I do not need creation to come to own the factors, since I
can homestead them by simply mining them from the ground and thereby
becoming the first possessor. On the other hand, if I fashion a sword
using your metal, I do not own the resulting sword. In fact, I may owe
you damages for trespass or conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, both of Long’s cases, that of group “labour mixing” and
that of transferring a private property right to a collective fail on
the grounds that they do not resolve the contradiction—we still have it
that the subset deemed unworthy of control do not actually own the
property in question. For his second case in particular, Long is making
the error of placing contract theory at the root, rather than property
theory. But contracts are contracts <em>about</em> property—a contract
defines a set of transfers of title to property. The concept of
“contract” is <em>descendant from</em>, not antecedent to the concept of
“property.” This is the stolen concept fallacy—Long steals the concept
of contract in his attempted
inversion.<sup><a id="fnr.26" class="footref" href="#fn.26" role="doc-backlink">26</a></sup></p>
<p>So to summarise: our rational theory of law has it that property
rights are <em>private</em> rights of
<em>exclusive</em><sup><a id="fnr.27" class="footref" href="#fn.27" role="doc-backlink">27</a></sup>
control over <em>scarce</em> resources, whose purpose is to avoid
conflicts over said resources.</p>
