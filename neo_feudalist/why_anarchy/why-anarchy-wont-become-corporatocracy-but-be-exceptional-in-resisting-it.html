<h1 id="this-text-in-an-faq-format-by-chatgpt">This text in an FAQ
format, by ChatGPT</h1>
<p><strong>Q: What’s stopping a rich person from hiring mercenaries and
taking over?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Their property and reputation would become
radioactive. Defense insurance agencies, insurance agencies also tasked
with providing defense, would drop them, other agencies would share
intel, and the black market they’d rely on would extort them. War is
expensive, defense is proportionally cheaper.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: But wouldn’t some corporations try to rule like feudal
lords?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Not without centralized coercive power. Corporations
depend on customer trust and voluntary contracts. If a corporation
violates the NAP, its value collapses and it faces legal
retaliation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: Doesn’t Statism have courts to prevent
tyranny?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, but those courts work <em>for the State</em>.
Imagine being hired to block your boss’s agenda—you’ll be replaced or
sidelined. Anarchist courts compete; their legitimacy comes from
persuasion, not monopoly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: What happens if judges or DIAs become
corrupt?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> They lose clients and credibility. Like any
business, bad service means market collapse. Unlike governments, they
don’t have a captive population or taxing power to fall back on.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: Can poor people afford justice under
anarchy?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes. Economies of scale mean DIAs will compete for
mass-market clients. Security becomes a subscription like phone or
health insurance—modular and affordable, especially with self-defense
discounts.</p>
<h1
id="corporatocracy-a-presumed-inevitability-in-anarchy">Corporatocracy:
a presumed inevitability in anarchy</h1>
<p>A common retort to the anarchist proposal of a Stateless, voluntarist
order is the fear of <strong>corporate or elite takeover</strong>: that
without a centralized State to restrain them, the ultra-wealthy will
transform society into a <strong>neo-feudal corporatocracy</strong>,
where economic titans become de facto rulers and everyone else a
vulnerable underclass.</p>
<p>At first glance, this concern seems intuitive: wealth brings power,
power seeks expansion, and if nothing constrains the powerful, what
stops them from becoming untouchable overlords? And if you’re wealthy
enough to always get your way, why <em>wouldn’t</em> you just install
yourself as a god among men?</p>
<p>This text argues that this narrative, though undeniably expressing a
valid concern, <strong>misunderstands both how decentralized law
enforcement works and what motivates real-world elites</strong>. The
anarchist order is not an open playground for warlords, but a
self-stabilizing network of voluntarily funded legal and defense
institutions with vested interests in the system’s preservation—designed
from the ground up to prevent domination, regardless of wealth. By
elaborating how a worst-case scenario is dealt with, this text serves to
also outline how lesser violations are dealt with.</p>
<p>Rich individuals today already possess more freedom, security, and
influence than any feudal lord could dream of. Ironically, that very
abundance makes them far less likely—not more—to take on the burdens of
rulership. Why waste time managing taxes, infrastructure, and unrest
when you can instead spend that time, effort and those resources to fund
space exploration, biohacking, or build your own island sanctuary on
your terms?</p>
<p><em>The reasoning outlined in this text also applies to regular
wannabe non-wealthy warlords.</em></p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-state-of-anarchy">What Is A State of Anarchy?</h1>
<p><strong>An anarchist territory</strong> is simply a territory over
which <a href="https://liquidzulu.github.io/the-nap/">the non-aggression
principle (NAP)-derived</a> <strong>natural law</strong> is the law of
the land. A synonym for <strong>“a state of anarchy”</strong> is thus
<strong>“a natural law jurisdiction”</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>non-aggression principle</strong> is defined as the
“prohibition of <em>the initiation of</em> uninvited physical
interference with a person’s person or property, or threats made
thereof”. Its implications can thus be roughly summarized as “hurt
someone, break their stuff or don’t keep your word, then expect
proportional punishment”. <strong>Natural law</strong> is merely the law
code that follows from this principle. <strong>Anarchist law
enforcement</strong> <em>decentrally</em> enforces natural law; a
natural law jurisdiction is one where natural law applies <em>over the
entire territory</em>, but where law enforcement agencies are not
responsible to a single highest law enforcement agency’s decrees,
<em>but to their clients, the wider natural law jurisdiction</em> and
<em>the authoritative judges’ verdicts</em> (see the section <em>How
Anarchist Law and Order Works: An Overview</em>). <strong><em>Anarchist
law enforcement is thus decentralized enforcement of a uniform and
universal law code.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anarchy lacks a <strong><em>monopoly on</em></strong>
<strong>legitimate use of force</strong> (i.e., force that enforces
natural rights), however, <strong>it lacking that monopoly on legitimate
use of force doesn’t authorize <em>illegitimate</em></strong> (i.e.,
force that violates rights) <strong>uses of force</strong>. A lack of a
monopoly on legitimate use of force merely entails <em>that no one can
be prevented from enforcing rights</em> (insofar as they don’t violate
rights in the process, which means that actors doing this will have to
acquire proper qualifications); part of enforcing rights means that
<strong><em>those violating rights have no right to resist having rights
enforcers enforcing rights in retaliation for their rights
violations</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This legal framework has many precedents:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>everyday conduct</strong>, people act according to it and
expect others to do the same at threat of eventual social ostracization
by themselves, independently of the fact that States usually penalize
NAP violations between subjects. Indeed, people in general have since
ancient times found the “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth”-principle intuitively appealing.<br />
</li>
<li>The “<strong>pre-State enforcement substrate</strong>” present in
many ventures in the private sector that engage in de facto private law
enforcement thanks to reputation, ostracization and freedom of
association — only being limited by State courts for authorization of
verdict enforcement (see corresponding appendix).<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>international anarchy among States</strong> in which
States act <em>between each other</em> as if the NAP were true and are
compulsory rights enforcement agencies for their citizens (see
corresponding appendix).<br />

<h1 id="how-anarchist-law-and-order-works-an-overview">How Anarchist Law
and Order Works: An Overview</h1>
<p>As per the NAP, all fees one will pay will come about from voluntary
exchanges. That being said, here are the outlines of freely financed
institutions that are very likely to emerge in an anarchist society.</p>
<p><img src="1.webp" /></p>
<h2
id="regarding-immediate-defense-of-ones-rights-defense-insurance-agencies">Regarding
Immediate Defense Of One’s Rights: Defense Insurance Agencies</h2>
<h3
id="the-basic-non-aggressed-based-business-model-underlying-defense-insurance-agencies">The
Basic Non-Aggressed-Based Business Model Underlying Defense Insurance
Agencies</h3>
<p>Core to anarchist law and order are <strong>defense insurance
agencies</strong> (DIAs) or <strong>rights enforcement agencies</strong>
(REAs), henceforth referred to as “DIAs”, that protect customers’
NAP-derived rights in exchange for payment. <strong>These agencies
basically serve as the representatives of individual layman customers to
the anarchist legal order</strong>: they are the actors specialized in
protecting customers’ rights, be it in case of overt attacks (or
proactive work to prevent instances thereof) and/or in case of the
client being embroiled in a legal dispute, all the while operating
within natural law’s confines.</p>
<p>Because DIAs will be seeking profits, they will expect their clients
to <strong>refrain from engaging in aggressive</strong> (as defined in
relation to the non-aggression principle, i.e. initiations of uninvited
physical interference against a person’s person or property, or threats
thereof) <strong>or provocative behaviors</strong> as a condition for
receiving their service: were these to not be restricted, then the DIAs
would simply be subsidizing costly initiatory confrontations, which are
potentially limitless, at their own expense, contrary to their desires
to make profits to make use of elsewhere; if they however were to drop
innocent people who are targets of initiatory attacks, then they
wouldn’t <em>receive</em> any customers at all. <strong>DIAs thus have
to balance customer security desires with compliance with the anarchist
order’s natural law framework.</strong></p>
<p>This beautifully aligns the profit-driven interests of the DIAs with
that of the preservation of an anarchist order: <em>the sheer market
logic makes DIAs opt for an order centered around
non-aggression</em>.</p>
<h4
id="the-non-aggression-and-non-provocation-necessary-conditions-for-security-serves-as-a-great-equalizer-between-rich-and-poor">The
Non-Aggression and Non-Provocation Necessary Conditions For Security
Serves As A Great Equalizer Between Rich And Poor</h4>
<p>An added benefit of non-aggressive and non-provocative behaviors
being necessary conditions for protection is that this way, DIAs’
service that crowd out offensively-oriented service providers, see the
section <em>What would happen to an individual rich person or a group
thereof that attempts to use their wealth to take over (parts of) the
anarchy</em>, due to defensive providers by definition necessitating
less expenditures in order to provide service and thus being more able
to proliferate and thus force offensively-oriented service providers to
adapt due to offensive services becoming too costly, will serve as a
great equalizer between rich and poor as it pertains to protection of
one’s rights.</p>
<p>As is elaborated in <em>Through relatively small regular
subscriptions, you can access larger resource pools, and thus impressive
security</em> and <em>Why corporations (and rich people) will acquiesce
to the NAP</em>, if even a poor individual abides by non-aggression and
non-provocation criteria, they will continue to be able to access
high-quality service that even wealthy individuals will at least find
very costly to overcome, and that if wealthy individuals don’t submit to
justice after having aggressed, then they will become actively pursued
outlaws relegated to the black market and sketchy black market security
provision.</p>
<p>As elaborated in <em>Anarchist law enforcement lacks this
conundrum</em>, DIAs will suffer at least mass unsubscribals if they
fail to provide appropriate promised rights protection, even if it’s a
low-paying client of theirs.</p>
<p>Consequently, if rich individuals were to attempt to aggress against
poor individuals under anarchy, they would be very likely to suffer an
unpleasant costly scenario as described in <em>What would happen to an
individual rich person or a group thereof that attempts to use their
wealth to take over (parts of) the anarchy</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>In other words, anarchy makes the bulk of security
provision conditional on adherence to natural law, deviations of which
will deprive one of its service, leaving one vulnerable to the full
force of it. Security under anarchy is like a Damocles sword that will
fall upon oneself if one aggresses against another.</em></strong></p>
<h3
id="the-inevitable-dominance-of-payout-based-dias-and-the-implications-thereof">The
inevitable dominance of payout-based DIAs, and the implications
thereof</h3>
<p>DIAs are very likely to be financed on <strong>a
subscription-basis</strong>. As a way to attract customers, they are
likely to, outside of their rights protection services, also promise
<strong>payouts</strong> to clients that are subject to unprovoked
(remember that the criterion for “provocation” will have to be rather
limited as to not scare away customers fearing being dropped for
perceived unjustified reasons) attacks. <strong><em>Indeed, the vast
majority of customers are likely to choose DIAs promising payouts in
case that they are victimized as that spreads out their risk
more</em></strong>. This means that a DIA willing to successfully appeal
to this great majority’s demand will have to find out ways to minimize
the risk that comes with promising payouts (better than other DIAs) to
clients in case of victimization. <strong>This directly incentivizes
said DIAs to engage in</strong> (<em>law-bound</em>, as committing
crimes in order to ensure that your client will not be subjected to
crimes will in turn cause you to be prosecuted by those you victimized)
<strong>preventative measures conducive to minimizing the risk for and
magnitude of payouts, <em>turning such DIAs into actively civilizing
agents</em>.</strong> Such DIA’s rights protections will thus be
<strong>proactive</strong> and <strong>rapidly responding</strong>,
since such actions reduce the amount of money they will have to pay out
in payouts.</p>
<p><strong>This contrasts State police whose “subscription fees” are
derived through unilateral impositions</strong>, giving them no
<em>direct</em> incentive to actually deal with crime, instead only
having the direct incentive to comply with their government superiors’
priorities. This is reflected in their infamous regular failures in
protecting citizens’ rights as per their and suboptimally allocating the
proper amount of resources for their services in response to market
demand, alternatively being underinvested or being overinvested. DIAs in
contrast will be under <strong>constant market pressure</strong> to
lower the price of their subscription fees all the while standing true
to their promises of rights protection, and thus be directly
incentivized to optimally allocate the appropriate amount of resources
to deal with a current crime level.</p>
<p>As we will see below, DIAs will also have the added benefit of having
direct incentives <strong>in increasing their clients’ security</strong>
as a way to reduce the risk of and magnitude of payouts, which stands in
stark contrast to <strong>Statist systems that don’t allow for tax
decreases in case of a reduction in risk level</strong>.</p>
<h3
id="why-anarchy-doesnt-decay-how-market-incentives-entrench-natural-law">Why
Anarchy Doesn’t Decay: How Market Incentives Entrench Natural Law</h3>
<p>Summary breakdown of this section: <em>The Recursive Legal Embedding
Process</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Barrier to Collapse (Foundational Layer):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The jurisdiction begins with at least a <strong>rudimentary
decentralized enforcement system</strong> that upholds natural law
against would-be usurpers.<br />
</li>
<li>This foundational capacity filters out overt attempts to reintroduce
domination or Statist power structures.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Market Entry and Onboarding:</strong>
<ul>
<li>New DIAs enter the market to insure property titles and offer
protection services.<br />
</li>
<li>These entrants are met with <strong>a legal operating environment
they must conform to</strong>—not by coercion, but by economic
necessity.<br />
</li>
<li>“These are the rules of the game here,” they realize. Non-compliance
leads to failed arbitration, reputational harm, and client loss.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Judges as Helmsmen of the Legal Order</strong> (see
elaborations elsewhere on how conflicts of interest regarding this role
are resolved by a society-judge dialectic on faithful application of the
law)
<ul>
<li>When disputes arise, <strong>authoritative judges interpret natural
law</strong> in real cases—especially edge conditions or ambiguous
applications.<br />
</li>
<li>DIAs must <strong>internalize and abide by these rulings</strong>,
or else risk misalignment with prevailing standards of justice.<br />
</li>
<li>This forces even ideologically neutral actors into
<strong>progressive alignment with evolving but bounded
precedent</strong>.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ratcheting Effect Through Institutional Memory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each generation of rulings solidifies a shared legal memory.<br />
</li>
<li>DIAs that endure the competition must <strong>stay current</strong>
with this memory and integrate it into their conflict resolution
protocols.<br />
</li>
<li>Those who fail are naturally selected out of the legal
ecosystem.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Natural Law Becomes an Embedded Operating System:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over time, the legal framework is no longer external to
profit-motivated actors—it is <strong>the environment they must master
to survive</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Even self-interested behavior becomes functionally equivalent to
norm-enforcing behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statist critics often claim that an anarchist society will
inevitably decay.</strong> They argue that as rights-enforcers in a
decentralized system accumulate power, they will be tempted to diverge
from natural law—seeking to dominate rather than defend. According to
this view, only a sovereign can enforce discipline, and without it,
chaos or corruption will follow.</p>
<p>This fear misunderstands both market dynamics and institutional
incentives under natural law which in fact directly align rational
self-interest with the system’s preservation.</p>
<h4
id="the-ratcheting-effect-of-providing-insurance-under-a-natural-law-paradigm">The
Ratcheting Effect Of Providing Insurance Under A Natural Law
Paradigm</h4>
<p>Non-aggression principle-based natural law delegates <a
href="https://liquidzulu.github.io/homesteading-and-property-rights/">rights
to exclusively direct specific scarce means</a>. Rights to exclusively
direct specific scarce means entail the right to exclude others from
disturbing direction of specific, <a
href="https://liquidzulu.github.io/defensive-force-and-proportionality/#the-just-means-of-defense"><em>insofar
as such exclusionary acts are proportional</em></a>. The right to
exclude others from disturbing direction of specific scarce means
<em>insofar as they remain proportional</em> entails the right to hire
actors to enforce it whenever necessary. People who have established
property rights over specific scarce means are expected to want to be
able to direct said scarce means: <strong>a market in protecting their
right to exclusively direct said scarce means will thus
emerge</strong>.</p>
<p>Natural law thus partitions the world into potentially (they are only
insurable insofar as they are not unowned/illegitimate/stolen property)
<strong>insurable property titles</strong>—each a distinct object over
which rights of exclusion can be enforced. This generates profit
opportunities for DIAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more property titles they lawfully protect, the more revenue
they earn<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br />
</li>
<li>Every new client deepens their stake in maintaining a jurisdiction
governed by the NAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even <strong>ideologically neutral actors</strong> are incentivized
to entrench the natural law framework—because <strong>doing so maximizes
profit and minimizes risk</strong>. Anarchy does not depend on
philosophical virtue. It depends on <strong>aligning self-interest with
legal compliance</strong>, where the underlying legal precepts <a
href="https://liquidzulu.github.io/the-nap/">are derived from
philosophical reasoning</a>, albeit still practical and realistically
enforceable.</p>
<h5
id="insurance-joining-rational-self-interest-with-stateless-law-enforcement-is-an-economic-argument.-what-kind-of-statelessness-this-insurance-industry-should-operate-in-is-predicated-on-philosophical-arguments.">Insurance
joining rational self-interest with stateless law enforcement is an
economic argument. <em>What kind of</em> statelessness this insurance
industry should operate in is predicated on philosophical
arguments.</h5>
<p>The above outlined joining of rational self-interest with a desire to
be <em>protected</em> through insurance is a mere economic argument.</p>
<p>What this argument doesn’t necessarily provide is the <em>extent to
which retaliations against rights violations can go</em>, such as in
punishment. This is rather derived from philosophical normative
arguments.</p>
<p>So, the skeptic could grant that statelessness upheld by insurance
agencies insuring property titles could work, but still argue that one
that specifically upholds natural law to be unviable. <strong><em>Why
would the DIAs resolve conflicts according to natural law out of all
legal codes?</em></strong></p>
<p>The reason why is a simple one: if a stateless order is implemented
and establishes <em>at least a rudimentary natural law-based
decentralized law and order</em> that can withstand attempts to replace
it with non-natural law, <strong><em>then participation within said
natural law-based stateless order will be predicated on compliance with
natural law</em></strong>. Once this is put in place, the following
steps will follow that see it strengthen itself by sheer virtue of
inviting actors that want to provide insurance services, who in
operating within its mutually corrective legal paradigm have to comply
with it in order to stay in business there.</p>

href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Under Anarchy is Generated
<em>Within</em> a Filtering Mechanism</h4>
<p>In an anarchist order, power is not granted by decree but
<em>earned</em> through performance. DIAs must consistently demonstrate
that they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uphold the non-aggression principle (NAP),<br />
</li>
<li>Respond effectively to threats,<br />
</li>
<li>And maintain trust through lawful, contract-bound behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any deviation—whether through incompetence, corruption, or
aggression—is punished by the market/wider anarchist order</strong>:
clients leave, alliances dissolve, reputations collapse and potential
prosecutions or punitive responses may follow if the deviations warrant
it — thereby diminishing the DIA’s competitiveness in the market to
insure property titles, leaving them vulnerable to be out-competed by
providers with superior performance. Power (see footnote 2) is thus
filtered through competitive pressure, not centralized coercion. The
competitive pressure in turn sets a tendency towards increased quality
in service and decreased cost.</p>
<p>See <em>Why corporations (and rich people) will acquiesce to the
NAP</em> and <em>The self-interested rationale behind ostracization</em>
for reasoning why the reputational radioactiveness of cooperating with
criminal actors are detrimental for someone wishing to gain more power.
Similar reasoning applies for doing criminal deeds.</p>
<h4 id="recursive-reinforcement-not-entropic-collapse">Recursive
Reinforcement, Not Entropic Collapse</h4>
<p>Contrary to the “entropy” argument, decentralized law enforcement
under natural law generates a <strong>self-reinforcing cycle of

<li>Each actor’s compliance with the NAP increases their

</li>
<li>Trust networks and business alliances form around demonstrated
reliability.<br />
</li>
<li>Clients, especially commercial ones, prioritize predictability,
legal soundness, and results.</li>
</ul>
<p>This system resembles an evolutionary process. Each generation of
DIAs must match or exceed the legal and operational performance of their
predecessors—<strong>including staying current with authoritative
judicial rulings</strong>. While most of natural law is stable and
intuitive, court decisions on novel or marginal cases clarify edge
conditions. DIAs that fail to incorporate such precedents risk losing
disputes, tarnishing their reputation, and alienating clients.</p>
<p>Thus, legal adaptation is not optional—it’s a competitive necessity.
<strong>Predatory divergence is not just immoral—it is structurally
self-destructive</strong> in a system where legitimacy and profit are
inseparable from lawful behavior.</p>
<h4 id="anarchy-resists-degeneration-into-statism">Anarchy Resists
Degeneration Into Statism</h4>
<p>Statist systems concentrate power, which enables corruption. In
contrast, anarchist institutions <strong>cannot “flip” into
States</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were built under legal constraints.<br />
</li>
<li>Their legitimacy is contractual, not coercive.<br />
</li>
<li>Their resources and influence derive from lawful service, not
unaccountable force.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Power under anarchy is lawful. Power under Statism is
unaccountable. One cannot be transformed into the other without
collapse.</strong></p>
<p>Trying to turn a DIA into a ruling force is as futile as converting a
logistics firm into a pirate navy. It’s not a pivot—it’s an
institutional collapse.</p>
<p>See the section <em>“But what if your DIA suddenly turns on you to
establish protection rackets?”</em> for the general principles
underlying why backstabbing one’s clients is such a very
high-risk-medium-reward venture.</p>
<h4 id="natural-law-as-a-stable-attractor">Natural Law As a Stable

two-tier conflict resolution system that DIAs will engage in; how
impartiality of judges will be maintained through mere market
interactions</h3>
<p><img src="2.webp" /></p>
<p>Being insurance agencies, DIAs will likely resolve inter-agency
disputes using <strong>a two-layered resolution system</strong>
(intra-agency dispute resolutions happen even smoother given that the
DIA will be able to single-handedly arbitrate the conflict) identical to
what contemporaneous insurance agencies engage in.</p>
<h4 id="layer-1-intra--or-inter-agency-conflict-resolution">Layer 1:
Intra- or Inter-Agency Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p><em>The first layer</em>, which is the one in which most conflicts
are likely to be resolved given the easily discernible nature of
NAP-violations and the fact that going to court is relatively more
costly, is the one where the two DIAs find out the truths underlying the
dispute and then given these facts resolve the dispute using
<strong>pre-established NAP-compatible inter-agency</strong>
<strong>conflict resolution protocols</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The agencies would prefer to not have to deal with any conflicts,
but doing so would deprive them of customers who then wouldn’t have
their rights be protected; if they dogmatically defend their clients,
then they will inevitably aid clients who have committed NAP-violations,
and thus aid criminals.<br />
</li>
<li>Consequently, the most straight-forward and defensible way to
resolve a conflict is to come to the truth of the matter and then judge
accordingly. To this end, having the clients comply in the investigation
of the matter will enable the DIAs to as quickly as possible find out
who, if any, caused the NAP-violation leading to the dispute, and then
prompt the potentially guilty client to accept proper punishment and/or
make amends.</li>
</ul>
<h4
id="layer-2-appeal-to-third-party-judges-authoritative-opinions">Layer
2: Appeal to Third Party Judges’ Authoritative Opinions</h4>
<p><em>The second layer</em> would follow as a consequence of severe
ambiguity regarding the truths underlying the dispute and/or severe
disagreements in how it should be resolved. To this end, the disputants’
DIAs appeal to <strong>judges</strong> or <strong>arbitrators</strong>
to give an impartial, conscientious and authoritative third party
opinion <em>on what natural law says regarding their dispute</em>, which
naturally they, <em>and the wider anarchist order</em>, will see as the
binding natural law-compliant verdict on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>In other words, if an authoritative judge says that disputant
X should be subject to punishment Y, all who obstruct the administration
of punishment Y against disputant X would be criminal accomplices also
justifiably punished.</strong> <strong>Anarchism could in fact be
understood as “Rule by natural law through judges”</strong> - <em>of
judges who impartially and faithfully interpret how natural law should
be enforced for specific cases and of voluntarily funded law enforcement
agencies which blindly adhere to these judges’ verdicts and administer
these verdicts within the confines of natural law.</em></p>
<p>The judges are the ones with the highest authority in legal matters
and are the ones with the official final say in disputes (of course
judges’ verdicts <em>can</em> be challenged, but in the vast majority of
cases, people will have reason to think that experienced and
authoritative judges’ verdicts correspond to the correct natural law
verdict). The judges’ authoritative verdicts serve as equalizers between
big and small DIAs: if a large DIA receives an unfavorable authoritative
verdict from a judge when in a dispute with a smaller DIA, if they then
refuse to comply with the verdict, they will suffer repercussions due to
infamy from actors throughout the entire natural law jurisdiction even
if they are a large DIA, which may amount to outright punitive
coalitions; see <em>The self-interested rationale behind
ostracization</em> for the reasoning why DIAs would care about
ostracizing and possibly militarily punishing those that refuse to
comply with authoritative verdicts; see <em>Why corporations (and rich
people) will acquiesce to the NAP</em> on how powerful entities
technically able to resist a swift enforcement of justice can be taken
down progressively, and why given the authoritativeness of judges’
opinions they will be.</p>
<ul>
<li>To address the elephant in the room: <strong>judges will only gain
authoritativeness by demonstrating that they impartially,
conscientiously and faithfully deliberate and rule in accordance with
natural law</strong>; a <strong>valid verdict</strong> is thus one
consisting of said characteristics, which entail a <em>confirmed</em>
absence of its opposites. Such authoritativeness only comes about from
the judge <em>proving</em> that they can be trusted with giving binding
third party opinions that accurately reflect <em>what natural law</em>
<em>says regarding what the just resolution to the dispute should
be</em>, and not the wishes of one of the disputants. If a judge cannot
<em>disprove</em> that they have a conflict of interest or are partial
in some way, <em>then their verdicts will be meaningless <strong>for the
simple reason that uncertainty regarding this means that it cannot be
known whether the verdict’s deliberations actually arrived at the truth
of what natural law would say regarding the proper resolution of the
conflict</strong></em>. A judge may have 1000 years of experience always
ruling correctly, but if they are brought to judge a conflict between
two parties and they refuse to for example (not saying that this is the
only way to ensure judicial discipline in anarchy, but it can certainly
be one) let third parties inspect whether they have possible conflicts
of interest with one of the disputants or other reason to be partial to
one of them, <strong>then clearly those 1000 years of consecutive
faithful rulings will not matter given that in this case</strong>, there
exists clear reason to doubt that the judge will honestly deliberate the
case in order to arrive at a verdict that only considered faithfulness
to natural law, <strong>leaving the conflict no closer to be actually
resolved: <em>competence in dealing with the law only matters if you are
willing to</em> impartially <em>use said competences for</em> faithful
<em>interpretations of natural law given the conflict at
hand</em></strong>. Maximal legitimacy comes to a verdict if the
disputants both agree about which judge should judge the dispute.
<ul>
<li>Thus, the common fear that anarchism will just devolve into rich
people dragging poor people to their preferred courts where poor can be
tried to the rich person’s favor—<em>i.e. that rich individuals would be
able to buy corrupt judges to rubber-stamp whatever they
want</em>—misunderstands what makes a verdict authoritative and binding
to such a degree that third parties are expected to respect it.
<strong>Even if a poor person commits a tort against a rich person, if
the rich person insists that he will only accept a conflict resolution
insofar as the poor person submits to the rich person’s preferred court,
the poor person has no duty to actually comply with this but instead
stand his ground until that the conflict can be resolved through
impartial third parties</strong>.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As conflicts are resolved, some judges’ relatively more skillful
verdicts will emerge to become more authoritative than others’. Said
authoritativeness isn’t fixed: while a judge may be deemed the most
authoritative one at one moment, if they make partial or flawed
verdicts, their authoritativeness will consequently diminish.</li>
</ul>
<h5
id="but-what-if-disputants-will-not-come-into-agreement-regarding-which-arbitrator-to-settle-the-dispute-with">“But
what if disputants will not come into agreement regarding which
arbitrator to settle the dispute with?”</h5>
<p>A conflict exists because <strong>the plaintiff is being denied their
natural rights</strong>. The plaintiff’s DIA will thus <em>be pressured
to</em> enforce their client’s rights through the legal system as
quickly as possible, lest it will hurt their reputation of reliably
enforcing rights, causing them to lose clients.</p>
<p><strong>The plaintiff only agrees to resolve the dispute insofar as
it’s tried in their preferred court</strong>: Then the conflict will
peter out since the plaintiff is not cooperative in resolving it.</p>
<p><strong>The defendant and their DIA obstinately refusing to cooperate
in the conflict resolution</strong>: the plaintiff DIA will be able to
appeal to an authoritative judge, call the defendant to the trial lest
they will have to be tried in absentia—which if properly done as to not
make it a case of someone calling a defendant to come to a favored court
in unreasonable time such that the trial seems to be abusive and
partial—will devastatingly weaken the uncooperative defendant’s case
given that such flagrant refusals to co-operate clearly indicate an
aversion to scrutiny.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example: the defendant only agrees to arbitration if their
preferred judge is selected</strong>. Such uncooperativeness will be
telling; the plaintiff will be able to record the uncooperativeness and
the partiality of the defendant’s preferred judge, which will serve to
empower the plaintiff’s case against the defendant as this shows that
the defendant actively tries to avoid justice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The disputants both want to resolve the dispute but insist on
only solving it by appointing their preferred judge</strong>: If they do
this… then they will annoy their clients, causing problems for their
businesses. There is a reason that insurance agencies even nowadays
decide which arbitrators they will resolve their dispute with
<em>before</em> that they enter into conflicts — if it takes time for
the conflict resolution to commence, clients will be irritated, and the
uncooperativeness with regards to picking a reputable judge when that’s
a relatively easy feat will hurt their reputation, since other insurance
agencies will take note of these disputants prolonging the conflict
instead of having proper conflict resolution protocols pre-established
or at least co-operated with finding a good compromise authoritative
judge.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-function-of-lawyers">On the function of lawyers</h3>
<p>Many seem to be under the impression that if someone has “the best
lawyer”, they will be able to evade justice even with overwhelming odds
against them. This is a slightly misinterpreted view.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyers</strong> are merely people trained to be
knowledgeable in the law and who with this knowledge help people with
their diverse legal needs. <strong>As it pertains to trials, what the
“best lawyer” is able to do is simply to be able to present the most
compelling legal case for their client <em>given the</em></strong>
<strong><em>provided amount of evidence</em></strong>. If however “the
best lawyer”’s client has an overwhelming amount of evidence stacked
against them, then the lawyer can’t really do much. No lawyer would for
example have been able to save nazi leaders from their fate in the
Nuremberg trials.</p>
<p>Admittedly, if you have better lawyers, you will be able to have them
make better cases for you, but that’s not the the be-all and end-all as
the judge will be obligated at pain of tarnishing their reputation to
neutrally judge cases, even if the other disputant has relatively
inferior lawyers. Like, if you can see in a judge’s justifications
(having the reasoning underlying a verdict be transparent for others to
evaluate will very likely be expected of judges in order to prove that
they are trustworthy) that they basically just went along with the case
presented by the disputant with “the best lawyer” and didn’t deliberate
the other disputant’s case carefully enough in spite of said disputant
maybe not having an as impressive presented case… then naturally those
not having the same quality of “the best lawyers” would feel slight
aversion to said judges. Higher-quality lawyer will help your case, but
not having a relatively higher-quality lawyer will likely not be
completely disastrous — especially given how objective the criterions
for anarchist crimes are.</p>
<p>Either way, recognizing that quality lawyer access would matter, DIAs
would procure such lawyers such that poorer clients would be able to
meet this want.</p>

inducing prosperity</h3>
<p><strong>Cheaper prices follow from an increased abundance of goods
and services</strong>, <em>especially if it’s distributed among several
competitors</em>. It’s worthwhile remarking that even producers that
seem to be the sole providers of something may choose to price it
relatively cheaper in accordance to their time preference; <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalMonopolyMyth/">so-called “natural
monopolies” have never existed</a>. <strong>Increased quality</strong>
similarly follows from producers having to cater towards specific
customer desires, which is the best actualized through competition.
<strong><em>Increased competition has a direct correlation to increased
quality and decreased costs; monopolies tend towards decreasing quality
and increasing costs.</em></strong></p>
<p>Increased abundance of goods and services follow when actors are able
to <strong>arrange scarce means in value-generating, i.e. conducive to
satisfying customer desires, ways</strong>.</p>
<p>Natural law’s non-aggression principle’s “prohibition of <em>the
initiation of</em> uninvited physical interference with a person’s
person or property, or threats made thereof”, <a
href="https://liquidzulu.github.io/the-nap/">which one may remark is not
arbitrarily chosen</a>, establishes a law code <strong><em>with the
least amount of “regulations”</em></strong> (for lack of a better word;
the NAP is non-legislative, so the “regulations” in question are not
arbitrarily malleable ones as is the case nowadays)<strong><em>, thereby
maximizing the amount of arrangements of scarce means that can happen
without initiating violations of the physical integrity of someone’s
person or property</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This as a consequence will cause an anarchist territory to be able to
produce <strong>an unprecedented degree of wealth</strong>, thereby
causing a general drop in prices, <em>correlating with an increased
societal enrichment</em>.</p>
<p>As a consequence, notwithstanding increased employment opportunities
and potential wage increases following from the increased competition,
the <strong><em>real</em></strong> <strong>wealth</strong> of
<em>anyone</em> in the anarchist territory will increase, <em>thereby
drastically reducing the cost of non-security-related expenditures,
which in of itself leaves more wealth to spend on security</em>.</p>
<h3
id="increased-competitiveness-in-security-services-will-increase-quality-and-decrease-cost-minimization-of-criminal-liability-will-be-the-only-constraint">Increased
competitiveness in security services will increase quality and decrease
cost; minimization of criminal liability will be the only
constraint</h3>
<p>The security service and product market will naturally also be
subject to the same ruthless competition that has always led to cheaper
prices and increased quality in other sectors. Anticipating worries
about supposed natural monopolies emerging in this market, I yet again
point to them never having existed as well as the fact that the security
service and product market will have incredibly low thresholds.</p>
<p>Additionally, DIAs will limit themselves to protecting the persons
and properties of people, alleviating the costs of their operations.</p>
<p>In the subsection <em>Defense scales exponentially; offense scales
linearly—and every attacker pays that difference</em>, the relation of
defensiveness to offensiveness is elaborated. The most important insight
from this is that if an attacker tries to capture a fortified position,
they will usually have to expend way more resources than it took to
erect the fortification. As elaborated in <em>Why maximal defensive
capabilities will be encouraged</em>, DIAs will naturally encourage such
fortification as much as possible due to it diminishing risk related to
a specific client.</p>
<p>Relevant for this section is to point out that these augmentations in
self-defense capabilities are very likely going to be made to
<strong>minimize criminal liability due to collateral damage</strong>,
lack of which will do more harm than good for the self-defender, but
with that taken into account, will unleash incredibly creative and
innovative ways to deal with aggression. For example, <em>to avoid
burglary</em>, property owners are likely to rather rely on more
sophisticated variants of current-day non-lethal anti-burglary measures
than lethal ones, such as landmines on one’s lawn or turrets in one’s
interior. One may imagine a smart anti-burglary ceiling-mounted AI-run
net gun system that gently but firmly ejects a carbon-fiber web when
triggered, asserting: <em>“Please remain calm while a response unit is
dispatched. Movement will tighten the net.”</em>.</p>
<p>Innovations of these sorts are likely to make even minor intentional
property rights violations into high-risk low collateral damage-risk
endeavors.</p>

<p>An expected concern when it comes to subscribing to DIAs is: <em>If I

subscribing to a specific DIA? The stakes of getting it right when

purchase will not break/explode after 1 month?<br />

</ul>
<p><strong>There are already so many goods and services we procure
without being personally experts in ascertaining their reliability, yet
are able to enjoy unprecedented degrees of innovation to facilitate our
lives.</strong> The same will apply to DIAs.</p>
<p>The way how DIAs will market themselves to inspire confidence in
customers will be identical to how any other service or product markets
themselves. <strong><em>Foundational to such marketability is to
demonstrate that you meet customer expectations</em></strong>, which is
the reason that the aforementioned non-monopolist ventures are able to
be relied on in spite of you personally not being an expert in their
ventures; if a goods or service provider has a reputation of providing
deficient services or products, then people will naturally avoid said
unreliable provider, just by sheer virtue of hearing that others
supposedly got a bad deal from said provider.</p>

<p>It’s also worthwhile noting <em>Self-Defense (Within Natural Law’s

Encouraged</em> underlying how rights enforcers’ encouragement of
self-defense will greatly complicate such backstabbing operations in
which the victims, especially thanks to their increased autonomous
self-defense capabilities, are able to appeal to other security
providers in order to counteract the backstabbing attempt, at which case
the backstabber will have accrued so much infamy for nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, this critique does in no way justify a State given that
Statism only entails further vulnerability.</p>
<h3
id="notable-ways-how-dias-will-inspire-consumer-confidence-will-likely-be-using-the-following">Notable
ways how DIAs will inspire consumer confidence will likely be using the
following:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Them specifying what their security services will protect for their
client, as to minimize legal liability.<br />
</li>
<li>Magnitude of insurance payouts.<br />
</li>
<li>Certifications from well-trusted certification agencies.<br />
</li>
<li>Price.<br />
</li>
<li>Reviews.<br />
</li>
<li>Transparently, as lacking transparency will give people great reason
to doubt, calculated statistics, <strong><em>out of which</em></strong>
<strong>the ratio of clients’ rights that have been successfully
defended from aggression</strong>(which is likely also expected to
include them seeing their perpetrator be adequately put to
justice)<strong>-to-the amount of clients’ rights that have not <em>will
be the perhaps the most important ratio that customers will look for
when selecting DIA</em>.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Remember that “aggression”, the initiation of uninvited physical
interference with someone’s person or property or threats made thereof,
constitutes a crime under anarchy. The one who commits it
<em>should</em> have to submit to justice and let their victim
administer the proper proportional punishment against them.<br />
</li>
<li>Naturally, customers are going to want to subscribe to a DIA that
will reliably enable them to come to such a position of administering
the proportional punishment in case of being aggressed against, at which
point they may negotiate with their perpetrator another deal that more
precisely pleases their desires, such as restitution.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The DIAs with high “rights successfully defended from
aggression-to-rights not defended” ratio based on factual metrics will
naturally be the ones that give customers the greatest confidence: they
will be the ones that both manage to defend their customers from
aggression AND which enable them to be in a position to unimpededly
administer proportional punishment, conducive to making the best out of
a wrong, thereby being the best people to subscribe to in order to be
protected against crime.</strong><br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The DIA demonstrating that they provide impartial inter- and
intra-agency judgements, even if one’s plaintiff or defendant is a more
high-paying customer of their or one’s DIA. Again, people subscribe to
DIAs to secure their rights: if they get to choose, of course that they
will choose an agency avoiding such flagrant negligence of justice,
which one may remark as elaborated in <em>Anarchist law enforcement
lacks this conundrum</em>, will become necessary to be able to extract
the greatest amounts of profits.<br />
</li>
<li>The amounts of attempted aggressions against clients of the DIA
might also prove attractive as that’s indicative of how well they are
able to deter potential aggressors.<br />
</li>
<li>Comparisons to rival DIAs. Rval DIAs are very likely to always seek
to expose their rivals as being inferior to them, to this end seeking to
point out their rivals’ relative inability to protect their customers as
well as they do, likely in reference to such “rights successfully
defended from aggression-to-rights not defended” ratios. <strong>If a
DIA were to hypothetically drop their customer and leave them to their
fate, then you could expect rival firms to expose this in order to evoke
uncertainty among clients of this rival DIA, thereby attracting
potential customers to them instead.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Just as most people today rely on complex technologies without
understanding their inner workings—using banks, smartphones, or
insurance—so too would people engage DIAs through simple,
consumer-facing interfaces designed for ease and reliability.</p>
<p>Inevitably, firms will establish great reputations of being reliable
as so many firms do nowadays such that people will be able to with minor
research find appropriate service provision.</p>
<p><strong>In other words, the nature of the market in security under
anarchy will not differ much from many other markets that we have
nowadays. The market of DIAs will just be another form of insurance
market. It will not be the case that large masses of people get
defrauded by fraudulent DIAs that leave them in the lurch under
anarchy.</strong></p>
<h2
id="through-relatively-small-regular-subscriptions-you-can-access-larger-resource-pools-and-thus-impressive-security">Through
relatively small regular subscriptions, you can access larger resource
pools, and thus impressive security</h2>
<p>A common concern regarding private rights protection is that modest
incomes will not be able to procure adequate security in order to
protect their rights, thereby leaving them to be predated.</p>
<p>What this view fails to consider is <strong>economies of
scale</strong>: <em>if you have one million people give you $1, you have
$1,000,000. While each contribution is small, they collectively amount
to a large quantity</em>. This is the same reasoning that drives large
corporations to produce products and services for sale to people of
modest incomes: superficially it might seem risky to produce hundreds of
thousands of gadgets each with a cost, but as you sell them with
monetary surpluses to a lot of people, these gadgets’ costs are
exceeded, bringing you profit. <strong>This paired with DIAs’ incentive
structures will make those of modest incomes <em>more</em> secure under
anarchy than under Statism. Under anarchy, DIAs will fiercely compete
over customers and as a consequence bring them <em>cheaper</em>,
<em>smarter</em> and more tailored services, just like smartphone,
automobile, and grocery providers already have.</strong> <em>Anarchy
will turn law enforcement into something that directly serves to protect
people’s rights instead of being a tool for the powers-that-be.</em></p>
<p>This is the same reason that DIAs inevitably will seek to tap into
the large demand present among those of relatively modest incomes by
providing rights protection in exchange for payment.</p>
<p>DIAs are also likely to provide <strong>differing tiers of quality
for their services</strong>, <em>thereby providing the firm more money
from clients that pay more which can be used to increase the quality of
the firm’s services in general</em>. While it may seem grotesque to
provide differing tiers of quality in rights protection, <strong>it’s
important to remember that for DIAs to receive customers, <em>they will
have to convince their customers that they can actually defend the
paying client’s rights</em></strong>; notwithstanding the fact that de
facto tiers of quality exist nowadays too as more wealthy individuals
can hire private security, and the fact that it really begs the question
what is unfair in some people paying more in security expenditures in
order to receive better quality of it. Those paying for <strong>lower
tiers</strong> will thus only pay for the lower tiers <em>on the
condition that the DIAs actually fulfill their rights protection
needs</em>: it will not be the case that DIAs’ lower-tier subscribers
will be neglected, <strong>the lower tier will still directly correspond
to protection of persons’ persons and property</strong>.</p>
<p>What the exact prices of DIAs specialized to people of modest incomes
will be, I can’t say for sure. However, I can make some cursory
remarks.</p>
<p>Adding upon the aforementioned section’s discussion on the factors
affecting prices of goods and services related to law and order, I will
also make some cursory remarks pertaining to those factors unique to
economies of scale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed costs</strong> (training, logistics, AI surveillance
systems) are spread across large subscriber bases.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Technology compounds scale</strong>: one drone, one
algorithmic threat analysis system, or one shared patrol route can
protect <em>many</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To nonetheless contextualize the numbers at hand, one could imagine
the DIA <strong>Sun Security</strong> that has:</p>

<p><strong>Charity</strong>, <strong>mutual aid societies</strong> and

<p>An obligatory remark is that thanks to an anarchist territory’s
increased competitiveness and minimization of regulation to the
non-aggression principle (which I may remark is comprehensive as per the
“hurt someone, break their stuff or don’t keep your word, then expect
proportional punishment” rough summary. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7-jvkFRYdo">The NAP even has
implications for environmentalism</a>.) will drastically reduce the
amount of poor people. It’s also worthwhile remarking that even if it
may be necessary for some to join together in such co-operative
ventures, it’s important to remember that the service they receive
through this will be much better quality than what people of
corresponding incomes receive nowadays.</p>
<h4 id="selling-prosecution-rights-to-bounty-hunters">Selling
prosecution rights to bounty-hunters</h4>
<p><strong>Anarchist law will be based on proportionality</strong>.
Consequently, if a poor person is punched in the face <em>mens rea</em>,
then said poor person would have <em>the right to</em> punch the
perpetrator in the face twice (once for restitution, another time for
retribution); if they come to a position of getting to punch the
perpetrator in the face, they might negotiate another resolution such as
monetary restitution.</p>
<p><em>This right to exact proportional punishment can be sold</em>,
meaning that <strong>if a really poor person is subject to a crime, they
can negotiate with someone that can more competently exact the
punishment on the conditions by which they would transfer this right of
theirs to the bounty-hunter</strong>, most likely in exchange for
payment. The bounty-hunter can then in turn collect information
regarding the specifics of the crime in order to then find the
perpetrator to then put him in a position where he will have to see the
punishment be exacted or negotiate some alternative resolution in place
of the exactment of the punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, when transferring such rights of exactment of
punishment, the bounty-hunter will have to ensure that the one reporting
the crime is speaking the truth, giving sufficient evidence that they
actually were target of a crime and don’t just intend to use them to
punish an innocent,</strong> in a similar way to how current police
works. An easy way to solve such conundrums would be to have the
reporting the crime sign a contract underlining that they are speaking
the truth regarding the specifics and that if they are found out to not
have done that, some penalty will be drawn.</p>
<h5 id="murder-cases">Murder cases</h5>
<p>Said very poor people can write a will/testament regarding to whom
the right to enforce a punishment against someone committing a crime
against them should go in case that they are killed before being able to
exact it or transfer it to someone else.</p>
<p>If they don’t have any will, then the murder case can be inspected by
other third parties who would be able to derive massive profits from
negotiating with the murderer on what conditions they, the defendant,
would relinquish their right to exact a death penalty against them.
One’s life is a precondition for using anything at all, so murderers set
in such positions will basically have to agree to anything, which puts
the one negotiating in a very good position to make a good deal out of
it.</p>
<h4
id="the-glaring-hypocrisy-in-asking-this-while-rejecting-a-one-world-government">The
glaring hypocrisy in asking this while rejecting a One World
Government</h4>
<p><img src="4.webp" /><br />
Anarchy and Statism are compared to unfair standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anarchy is oftentimes deemed to fail if it cannot <em>ensure</em>
that every individual will have baseline wants met<br />
</li>
<li>… yet Statism can continuously be excused by virtue of it supposedly
<em>trying</em> to achieve its goals. The perverse underlying idea is
that the State could solve the problem if we just threw more money at
it, and that the reason it doesn’t work as intended currently is because
it doesn’t have more money.</li>
</ul>
<p>The State doesn’t guarantee protection <em>to anyone</em>. All that
State provision does is put said service or goods provision under a
monopoly that one cannot opt out from, which will tend towards
increasing prices and decreasing cost. It doesn’t guarantee anyone
anything, as demonstrated by the fact that not a single State has a 0%
crime rate.</p>
<p>Statists are even more hypocritical in appealing to this argument
given the fact that there currently are millions of people with inferior
security provision to that which they have. <strong>If they truly think
that anarchy is intolerable due to others receiving better security
provision than others, then they must reject the international anarchy
among States in which this is precisely the case between subjects of
different compulsory DIAs (States).</strong></p>
<p>The only way to solve this problem is to subject everyone to a One
World Government that can equitably allocate resources to avoid
inequalities in quality of security provision by virtue of belonging to
another DIA.</p>
<p>The visceral “what about the poor?” reaction is a hypocritical
egalitarian impulse that calls for depriving the majority of higher
quality and less costly security such that everyone will
<em>nominally</em> be protected.</p>
<h3
id="how-dias-are-likely-to-deal-with-the-increased-risk-following-from-increased-amounts-of-insureds-in-similar-ways-to-how-other-scalable-insurance-models-do">How
DIAs are likely to deal with the increased risk following from increased
amounts of insureds — in similar ways to how other scalable insurance
models do</h3>
<p>Admittedly, while DIAs are able to derive great revenues from having
many individuals each pay relatively small payments, they, unlike other
businesses becoming rich in these ways, also have to be ready to incur
costs in case that each of their clients’ individual rights are
violated, meaning that as they accept more clients, they also accept
more risk.</p>
<p>Further elaborations are given below, but here are some outlines,
which mirror the core logic of any scalable insurance model:</p>
<p>Crucially, unlike traditional insurance models that passively
underwrite risk, DIAs actively <strong>shape behavior and security
conditions</strong> through incentive structures, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differentiated premiums</strong> based on geography, known
threats, or lifestyle risks;<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Discounts and bonuses</strong> for reinforced self-defense
capabilities (see below);<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Contractual obligations</strong> for risk-reducing conduct
(e.g., secure storage, surveillance compliance <em>which of course is
likely to be paired with contractual obligations by the DIA to not use
said surveillance for other purposes than to provide their services more
optimally</em>, non-provocative behavior).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the more clients a DIA serves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The better its <strong>predictive analytics</strong> become (via
aggregated data);<br />
</li>
<li>The more it can <strong>cross-subsidize rare, expensive
payouts</strong> with consistent low-risk subscribers;<br />
</li>
<li>And the more diversified its portfolio of risk becomes across
<strong>locations, demographics, and threat environments</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows the DIA to scale <strong>not just income</strong>, but
also <strong>statistical predictability</strong>, which is a critical
advantage over bureaucratic State policing that neither adapts nor
prices risk efficiently.</p>
<h3
id="self-defense-within-natural-laws-constraints-will-be-authorized-to-its-fullest-extent-and-encouraged">Self-Defense
(Within Natural Law’s Constraints) Will Be Authorized To Its Fullest
Extent, And Encouraged</h3>
<h4
id="defense-scales-exponentially-offense-scales-linearlyand-every-attacker-pays-that-difference">Defense
scales exponentially; offense scales linearly—and every attacker pays
that difference</h4>
<p>As a rule of thumb, one could say that <em>For any given investment
of resources, defense buys more security than offense buys success</em>,
where “success” pretty much pertains to one’s ability to successfully
capture a specific desired scarce mean through force <em>all the while
retaining its physical integrity as much as possible</em><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
This may also be expressed as “Ceteris paribus, the cost of breaking a
defensive position exceeds the cost of building it.”</p>
<p>In physical security—as in warfare—<strong>defense enjoys inherent
efficiency advantages</strong>. The cost of establishing a strong
defensive position is almost always lower than the cost of overcoming
it. That’s why castles withstood sieges, and why modern passive
systems—turrets, mines, sensors, or reinforced entries—can repel
attackers many times more resourced than the defender.</p>
<p>This principle doesn’t change in anarchy. A modest-income household
might invest what amounts to a few grams of gold in defensive tech and
strategic reinforcement, <strong>while any attacker trying to break in
could face a deployment cost equivalent to 20 kilograms of gold just to
succeed</strong>—and likely far more once retaliation and legal costs
are factored in.</p>
<p>This asymmetry creates a powerful deterrent: <strong>aggression
becomes a losing game, economically and reputationally</strong>.</p>
<h4
id="why-maximal-defensive-capabilities-will-be-encouraged-it-reduces-the-risk-for-dias">Why
maximal defensive capabilities will be encouraged: it reduces the risk
for DIAs</h4>
<p>Furthermore, as insurance agencies that just happen to be tasked with
dealing with the risk of unprovoked attacks, <strong>DIAs will seek
measures to diminish risk and magnitude of payouts</strong>, such as
providing lower premiums in case of relocation to a safer location or
evidence of augmented self-defense capabilities, be it smart locks,
non-lethal deterrents, passive surveillance, fortification or proving
oneself capable to manage weaponry facilitating defensive maneuvers.
<em>This in turn introduces an excellent feedback loop where the safer
one becomes, the cheaper one’s protection will become</em>.</p>
<p><em>Due to the sheer market logic, an anarchist territory will be
much more optimally</em> (again, security providers will seek to ensure
that the self-defense measures don’t generate collateral damage leading
to accidental criminal liability) <em>defended than a corresponding
Statist one.</em></p>

angle: If the State ceased levying taxes, its security production would
remain as a baseline, upon which the inelastic demand for security
creates fierce competition improving it due to customer choice selecting
for the better given a current provided supply</h3>
<p>If the state stopped levying taxes upon its citizenry:</p>
<ul>
<li>The state’s security providers (as well as all the other things it
operates), whose security provision statists argue is at least
<em>satisfactory</em>, would remain, only now deprived of their
compulsory funding, having to modify their behaviors in order to
directly satisfy customer desires, at pain of going out of
business.<br />
</li>
<li>Tax payers’ revenue streams would continue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The state ceasing to levy taxes consequently merely shifts
the focus of state-run services from what the state prioritises to what
customers desire.</strong></p>
<p>There is much reason to believe that even if the state stopped
levying taxes, even people of modest incomes would be able to afford
security in the immediate short-term, even before the market in security
provision’s fierce competition would unleash its tendency for greater
quality and lower cost (and thus of increased accessibility).</p>

U.S. spends approximately $407 on police per person each year</a> in
taxes — one of the highest levels in the world. If Americans can already
afford this under taxation, why wouldn’t they afford it voluntarily?
Especially when competition would cut costs and improve accountability.
Remark: the fact that the state also taxes “non-rich” individuals
immediately reveals that “the rich” aren’t the sole reason for society
being kept together — the great revenues derived from “the non-rich” are
integral. This in turn means that “the rich”’s taxes supposedly
subsidizing “the non-rich”’s provision isn’t the reason that the latter
have access — “the non-rich” have access because their incomes finance
their local law enforcement, only that they don’t get to decide
<em>how</em> their incomes are allocated to secure them on a freely
chosen private subscription-basis which would have the otherwise
politician-allocated expenditures be allocated directly by the citizens
in a way that directly satisfies their specific security needs.</p>
<p>This suggests that if the state ceased levying taxes, even in the
short-term before that the competitive forces would see increases in
quality and decreases in cost of security provision, people would be
able to afford security. <strong>The State-run police, only now deprived
of its mandatory financing, would provide a baseline of security
provision from which the tax-free society will improve
upon.</strong></p>

the qualification process for police is unnecessarily inefficient,
effectivize the process such that market demand can be met more quickly

<p>Security has furthermore a very low barrier for entry; all it has to

be achieved in very creative ways without requiring high costs.</p>

<h1 id="the-self-interested-rationale-behind-ostracization">The
self-interested rationale behind ostracization</h1>
<p>One may intuitively wonder why DIAs would even bother with dealing
with aggressors that haven’t directly aggressed against one of their
clients. After all, if they do so, then they expend resources on a
threat that might not even target them.</p>
<h2
id="the-lose-lose-scenario-of-trying-to-justify-ones-aggression-i.e.-ones-claim-of-deserving-to-stand-above-the-law">The
lose-lose scenario of trying to justify one’s aggression, i.e. one’s
claim of deserving to stand above the law</h2>
<p>If you have engaged in an aggressive deed <em>and is currently on the
run from law enforcement and actively refusing to engage in the justice
system over your crime</em>, then you can do two things to justify your
deeds not resolved by <strong>official lawful conflict resolution
mechanisms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a justification as to why you thought that said aggressive
deed was justified, so much so that you feel no need dealing with the
client’s DIA’s, <strong>thereby effectively declaring oneself as someone
seeing themselves as standing above the law, i.e. an outlaw</strong>,
and thus a threat to potentially everyone in the anarchy who may be the
target of your outlawry that might be turned against them one day.<br />
</li>
<li>Not provide a justification, in which case all who value their
security and that of their clients, as with DIAs, must assume that you
are an outlaw ready to engage with it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, if you engage in aggression in anarchy and then continue to
<strong>evade official conflict resolution mechanisms</strong>, <em>the
most rational thing to assume is that you are going to repeat it</em>.
If you are likely to repeat it, then potentially <em>anyone</em> in the
anarchy may be a target for your next outlawry, which then directly
concerns DIAs and their clients to whom they have to allocate resources
in case of aggression. <strong>DIAs are thus directly incentivized to
<em>proactively</em> deal with outlaws, as proactive action that is done
at one’s own deliberation is usually less costly than reactive one,
making natural law outlaws be under constant pressure until they submit
to justice.</strong></p>
<p>As a consequence, DIAs are very likely to <strong>share information
about outlaws that they detect within the anarchy</strong>, given that
such reconnaissance for outlaws would either way be done by each of
them, and sharing this information becomes an easy way for them to
easier deal with threats against their clients <em>without giving any
unique benefit to their competitors</em>. Participating in
reconnaissance sharing for outlaws is a win-win scenario: <em>in
exchange for seeing your reconnaissance regarding potential outlaw
risks, each of which can constitute risks against one of your clients,
you get to see the DIA’s reconnaissance information regarding potential
outlaws of the one you share to</em>. This is going to be especially
more of a no-brainer for DIAs that are in official alliances between
each other.</p>
<p>This resembles that of what Las Vegas casinos do with informing each
other about bad clients. Of course, someone tapping into such a
reconnaissance sharing for the intention of solely free-riding is likely
to be excluded.</p>
<h2 id="killing-a-victim-doesnt-free-you-of-the-infamy">Killing a victim
doesn’t free you of the infamy</h2>
<p>Those who will be victimized are likely to have signed testimonies
delegating the right of specific third parties to enforce the justified
justice against their murderer in their name. Defense insurance agencies
might also in absence of such agreements be able to enforce the justice:
if a murderer murders someone… then the murderer cannot coherently
object to the execution of the proportional punishment, whoever manages
to bring to court, prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt and then
enforce it.</p>
<p>As a consequence, it’s not the case that if you kill someone insured
to a DIA, then the victim will not be able to call the DIA and thus the
DIA will not punish the murderer: it’s in fact rather likely that DIAs
will by themselves engage in proactive measures against murderers due to
the sheer profitability to be extracted from them by proposing an
alternative deal.</p>
<h2
id="flight-from-justice-makes-you-into-a-social-pariah-liability-until-that-justice-has-been-exacted">Flight
from Justice Makes You Into A Social Pariah Liability (Until That
Justice Has Been Exacted)</h2>
<p>If you are a confirmed criminal (which will be confirmed by the sheer
fact of you refusing to officially resolve the dispute) <em>who refuses
to submit to justice and constantly evades it</em>, <strong>concerned
parties wanting to see the hammer of justice strike upon you</strong>
will seek to employ all lawful means to see this happen. <em>It might
also be worthwhile remarking that natural law prescribes proportional
punishment to crimes, meaning that victims and DIAs will have direct
incentives in exacting justice against the criminal as they have direct
potential revenues to extract from punishing the outlaw adequately</em>,
such as by negotiating a preferential deal for them in order to not have
the proportional punishment be exacted. In other words, if you evade
justice… then the DIAs will just be justified in stacking heavier
charges against you making their justified punishment greater,
incentivizing them more to catch you.</p>
<p>If you are a social pariah/outlaw, <em>anyone who helps you could be
suspected of aiding and abetting, <strong>where the helper’s knowledge
of your outlaw status will be the deciding factor</strong></em>. If you
for example as an outlaw try to invest in a corporation, the corporation
would through your ownership in it finance you, a known criminal,
through dividends and the fact that the shares you own can be sold to
provide you revenues — revenues with which you may continue to finance
your evasion and/or future criminal ventures. This mirrors the basic
anti-crime measures taken nowadays in order to prevent accidental
criminal financement from the white market.</p>
<p>If your victim’s DIA remarks that you are a shareholder of a specific
corporation, they will naturally inform the corporation about the fact
that they aid and abet a criminal actor by keeping said criminal as a
shareholder, and thus a recipient for the aforementioned financing, in
their corporation.</p>
<h3
id="implications-of-refusing-to-comply-with-cutting-revenue-streams-to-criminals-a-contagion-of-criminal-liability">Implications
of refusing to comply with cutting revenue streams to criminals: a
contagion of criminal liability</h3>
<p>Continuing on the corporation example, <strong><em>whose underlying
logic is representative of all other forms of revenue provision to
confirmed criminal actors</em></strong>, if for some reason the
corporation directly financing a criminal through dividends and share
values refuses to cutting the revenue streams, <em>then at least the
ones of the corporation <strong>responsible with being able to cut the
revenue streams</strong> will officially be criminal accomplices able to
be prosecuted accordingly</em>. At that stage, these people will be
<em>knowingly</em> financing a known criminal and refusing to do
anything about it, making the scenario tantamount to these people
directly donating to a direct criminal. <strong>If you donate to a
criminal <em>knowing</em> that said criminal will use said funds to
engage in criminal ventures, then it’s self-evident that you are a
criminal accomplice — were it not so, then criminal bosses that don’t do
the on-the-ground crime wouldn’t be criminal.</strong> Because of this,
the relevant corporate responsibles would also become criminal
accomplices in case of cutting the revenue streams to the criminal.</p>
<p>As a consequence, said corporate responsibles would become justified
targets for the wronged victim’s DIA’s enforcement of justice over the
injustice done against the victim, in turn making said corporate
responsibles into outlaws/social pariahs, to whom revenue provision or
help in evading justice would in turn make you into a criminal
accomplice justified in punishment.</p>
<p>Thus, the corporation would in turn have to at least eject the
relevant criminally liable corporate responsibles from the corporation
who in turn would only have their defense insurance agency to call upon,
<em>which would expectedly call upon their client to submit to justice
such that they aren’t also tainted by the criminal liability</em>, lest
the liability would spread to more actors throughout the
corporation.</p>
<p>If the wider corporation refuses to eject the criminal accomplices
(<em>and so on</em>), then the liability would spread around the
corporation to such a degree that <strong>the corporation’s hired
insurance agencies and DIAs would have to disengage at pain of also
being tainted by the criminal liability</strong>, leaving the
corporation vulnerable for the hammer of justice.</p>
<p>Such prosecutions would likely be <strong>co-financed by rival
firms</strong> who have everything to gain from exploiting a
corporation’s unlawful conduct in order to weaken them. Financing the
prosecution of the corporation that abets criminal actors becomes the
closest thing for a rival firm to directly sabotaging their competitor,
<em>only that doing so, they do a good thing</em>.</p>
<p>As the corporation is starting to have to deal with these
controversies, <strong>the share values are naturally expected to be
negatively affected</strong>, since such uncertainty naturally
jeopardizes the corporation’s value generations, which is one of the
primary reasons for corporate leadership to avoid disasters like that in
the first place.</p>

resistant to corruption as a simple consequence of partial or

shareholders engages in or authorizes criminal deeds, they may
potentially be fired and/or left to their fate by superiors.</em></p>
<p><strong>It’s thus important to remember that talking about a
“corporate takeover scenario” is really a misnomer: a “corporate
takeover scenario” is rather a <em>“people disposing of large quantities
of money that happen to be derived from corporate profits”-takeover
scenario</em>.</strong></p>
<p>With the exception of security-providing corporations, <em>no
corporation has internal structures through which to exert substantive
force</em> ― such tasks are delegated to more competent third parties
specialized in it.</p>
<p>If some shareholders of a corporation were to decide to engage in
NAP-violating criminal ventures, they wouldn’t do it <em>through the
corporation</em>, <strong>but rather by deciding to allocate <em>the
corporate profits</em> to some unrelated third party <em>specialized in
conquest</em></strong>.</p>

<h4
id="general-reasoning-following-from-individuals-spending-on-armies-of-crime">General
reasoning following from individuals spending on armies of crime</h4>
<p>Be they individual rich people or <em>some</em> shareholders (i.e.,
the shareholder collective isn’t majoritarily voting to direct corporate
profits for the illegal ends, but some among them merely appropriate
their revenues and then use them for their criminal ventures) that for
some reason decide to allocate the corporate profits they receive to
criminal ventures, the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembling or hiring an army that is <strong><em>ready to engage in
aggressive warfare</em></strong> will be incredibly costly given the
facts that:<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Such armies would need enough resources to be able to overpower the
defense insurance agencies (DIA) of people operating within natural
law’s non-provocative and non-aggressive confines. As established above,
even poor people can relatively easily gain access to impressive
defensive services, and fortify their properties. <strong>Whereas DIAs
only need to deter aggressive actions and if necessary deliver damage
into aggressors as to make them retreat or if possible fully neutralize
them, aggressive armies need to fully neutralize their targets in order
to take them over, making them necessarily have to expend more assets in
order to overpower the DIAs defensive capabilities</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>The soldiers in the armies tasked with fighting the rich person’s or
persons’ offensive wars would permanently taint their reputations and
thus make them into outlaws/social pariahs, thereby practically
relegating themselves to the black market for the rest of their lives,
making them naturally demand adequate, costly, compensation for having
to live this life as an outlaw.<br />
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By engaging in offensive actions, the rich person engaging in such
ventures would be <strong>dropped from their regular defense
agencies</strong>: in order to not waste money financing aggressive
actors, DIAs make their service conditional on the actor not engaging in
aggressive or provocative behaviors that are likely to force the DIA to
spend assets on intentional conflict initiation. <strong><em>This would
in turn leave the rich individual entirely at the mercy of the black
market mercenaries that they have assembled or
hired.</em></strong><br />
</li>
<li>The rich outlaw’s DIA will be the first witness to their transition
to criminal life, be it as the rich outlaw assembles <strong>their
shadow army of crime</strong> (assembly of which will be publically
discernable by a very curious rise in prices of offensive
capabilities-related stuff) or at the first instance that the rich
outlaw deploys his army of crime ― <em>inevitably, his DIA will have to
remark that their client has been involved in a confrontation, at which
point they will quickly find out that their client was the one to fire
the first shot</em>.<br />
</li>
<li>As outlined in <em>The self-interested rationale behind
ostracization</em>, the rich outlaw’s DIA will then report to its
reconnaissance network about their client that has gone rogue and his
army of crime, making the rich outlaw a <em>de facto</em> a social
pariah/outlaw/public enemy to be neutralized, <em>even if at this point
the wider public might not at this point perceive it as such</em>.<br />
</li>
<li><em>Even if</em> a rich outlaw manages to make some gains in their
criminal spree, their criminal deeds would quickly gain them greater
infamy which would have <strong><em>the public
consciousness</em></strong> at this point recognize their status as a
social pariah/outlaw/public enemy in need to be neutralized as soon as
possible: <em>if an actor disregards the law, then everyone is a
potential target</em>. If the sharing of information between the DIAs
didn’t make it happen already, <em>then at this point the rich outlaw
would have permanently ostracized himself from civil society and
relegated himself besides his army of crime to life in the black
market.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="6.webp" /></p>
<h4 id="regarding-corporations-actively-engaged-in-crime">Regarding
corporations actively engaged in crime</h4>
<p>Regarding corporations, assuming a social pariah/outlaw/public enemy
reputation will entail even more disastrous implications.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a corporation allows <strong>a known outlaw to be a
shareholder</strong>, then said corporation is directly abetting said
outlaw by providing them revenues in the form of the dividends and
wealth in the form of the shares with accompanying value with which to
finance their criminal ventures. See <em>Flight from Justice Makes You
Into A Social Pariah Liability (Until That Justice Has Been
Exacted)</em> for an elaboration.<br />
</li>
<li>If <strong>all of or the majority of shareholders voted to</strong>,
as per the corporate takeover fear-mongering scenarios, <strong>to
direct corporate profits to criminal ventures</strong>, then pretty much
the same problems as above would ensure for them. Given that in such a
scenario the corporation becomes a big money laundering scheme through
which to finance crime, then naturally the employees of the corporation
and especially the board of directors and CEO would be forced to take a
stand: continue being a criminal accomplice that abets the shareholders
in financing crime, or co-operate in putting an end to it. At least the
board of directors and CEO would be criminally liable in case of a
failure to co-operate in ending the criminal financing given the
tangible power they have.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="the-current-day-implementations-of-the-aforementioned-measures-with-intended-effect-which-can-be-replicated">The
current-day implementations of the aforementioned measures with intended
effect, which can be replicated</h3>
<p>Contemporaneously, we see such corrective mechanisms in action.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the world’s richest people were to assemble or hire an army with
which to carve out their own fiefs in lightly defended territories like
in Africa <em>to which to move all of their wealth outside of the grasp
of tax agencies</em> as well as to serve as their own personal
autocracies. <strong><em>Yet, we don’t see this happen, but in fact see
the world’s wealthiest remain within jurisdiction in which they pay
heavy taxes</em></strong>. Evidently, this is because such rich people
realize the strong pushback that would follow from such criminal
endeavors: their reputation and brand would collapse over them
mask-slipping their cruel autocratic intents, and their assets and
investments would be seized.
<ul>
<li>If one believes that billionaires have strong autocratic tendencies,
then one has to admit that the status-quo presents concrete ways by
which to restrain their supposed autocratic inclinations:
<strong><em>these mechanisms might as well be used in
anarchy</em></strong>.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The international anarchy among States is one where large power
imbalances exist, yet is one in which smaller neighbors’, contrary to
what critics of anarchy might make one think, sovereignty is respected
in spite of neighboring larger more powerful entities. In this
international anarchy among States, peace overwhelmingly reigns, and
this <em>in spite of</em>, unlike with people deriving their profits
from voluntary exchanges, the fact that States <em>are directly
incentivized to enlarge themselves in order to acquire more resources
and taxable subjects</em>. <strong>If an anarchy of actors <em>with
incentive structures favoring aggressive expansion</em> manages to
overwhelmingly converge at peace, then we have all reason to believe
that an anarchy of actors <em>without such incentive structures</em>
will do the same.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-rich-people-actually-want">What rich people actually
want</h1>
<p>Most likely as a consequence of the prominence of “rich versus
poor/non-rich” narratives, <strong><em>many seem to be under the
impression that a society will either be one where the non-rich dominate
over the rich or one where the rich dominate over the
non-rich</em></strong>, where domination is vaguely understood as
“members of the dominating group having the final say in how some state
of affairs should be”.</p>
<p>Mass electoralism effectively channels this perception of having the
non-rich supposedly dominate the rich by virtue of having political
officials be elected on the basis of mass approval, thereby making it
seem as if said officials will act on the non-rich majorities’ behalf,
where preventing domination of the rich is one of the primary implicit
concerns, or if they don’t, can be aligned to do so in a hypothetically
better form of mass electoralism that is more responsible to the masses
concerns to ensure domination of the masses over the wealthy.</p>
<p><strong>This zero-sum “domination binary” view fails to take into
account the fact that wealthy individuals in the majority of the cases
don’t necessitate such domination over non-rich individuals in order to
achieve their desired ends</strong>, and if a society has adequate law
enforcement mechanisms, as outlined above for an anarchist society
ordered around the non-aggression principle’s “hurt someone, break their
stuff or don’t keep your word, then expect proportional
punishment”-maxim, then seeking such degrees of domination will be
<em>detrimental</em> for the attainment of one’s desired ends.</p>
<h2
id="wealthy-individuals-are-not-threatened-by-others-being-well-off-conquering-the-non-rich-is-redundant">Wealthy
individuals are not threatened by others being well-off; conquering the
non-rich is redundant</h2>
<p>A common concern that is raised on the matter of statelessness is the
fear that once the State, the perceived institution tasked with ensuring
the non-richs’ domination over society, is dismantled, then there will
exist nothing more to contain the power of “the rich”, causing them to
establish a <strong>“neo-feudal” order</strong> in this supposed power
vacuum where the rich hoard all the wealth and all the rest are made
destitute and put entirely under the mercy of rich people that now walk
around society as god among men, as per the mythologized vulgar
understanding of feudalism.</p>
<p>If wealthy individuals could snap their fingers and for this to
happen, then sure that some would maybe do it. Indeed, many non-rich
would want to do the same, so the concern is rather one of rich people
being such people who just happen to be empowered.</p>
<p>In reality however, to establish such a “neo-feudal” order, wealthy
individuals would have to expend massive amounts of resources which thus
wouldn’t be made available towards other ends — <em>and for what end
exactly</em>? If you are a very wealthy individual, plundering less
wealthy individuals’ wealth provides very little marginal utility,
<em>especially if you already make a lot of money through voluntary
means</em>, but will <strong><em>definitely</em></strong> cost you in
terms of actual expenditures dispensed for the purpose of vanquishing
(highly defended due to encouragements thereof as per <em>Why maximal
defensive capabilities will be encouraged</em>) individuals and their
DIA(s), and in the form of opportunity costs following from such
infamous acts as per the discussions above, <em>just so that you can
make this victim into your servant doing as you wish</em>.
<strong>Establishing a “neo-feudal” order is like destroying a city in
order to absolutely rule over the rubble.</strong></p>
<p>As described above, non-rich people will subscribe to DIAs whose
security provision is made on a defensive basis, meaning that wealthy
individuals will not be threatened by potential coalitions of non-rich
people seeking to expropriate their assets.</p>
<p>Thus, seeking to establish a “neo-feudal” order in which the rich are
god among men—or even attempting to establish it—is going to be too
costly, and the rich don’t have to engage in pre-emptive strikes against
the non-rich masses in order to prevent them from liquidating them.</p>
<p><strong>This naturally leaves rich people to achieve their ends with
those means that by definition distinguish them: using their
distinguishing wealth to engage in peaceful lawful voluntary exchanges
conducive to achieving their goals.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If power is measured by the ability to shape the future,
the modern capitalist already outpaces the absolute
monarch.</em></strong></p>
<p>“Imagine you could have $250B, free and clear—or $250B plus the
obligation to run New Zealand like a warlord, manage its politics,
defend its borders, and prevent revolt. Most people with real wealth
don’t want to rule—they want to opt out.”</p>
<h2 id="the-burdensome-aspects-of-autocratic-rule">The burdensome
aspects of autocratic rule</h2>
<p>Something to remark is that governance ties resources that could be
used towards other ends into governance. If you as a rich individual
establish an autocratic realm over, say, Congo, over which you seek to
nation-build, then these nation-building efforts will take away
resources that could be used towards other ends, and only tie the
resources into a rather cliché venture. To manage your own autocracy,
you will need to personally prop up its institutions and public
infrastructures.</p>
<h3 id="the-more-realistic-wealthy-person-abuse-scenarios">The more
realistic wealthy person abuse scenarios</h3>
<p>The way that wealthy individuals are the most prone to, as has been
the case with corporate malfeasance historically, abuse power <em>is
rather by trampling on other peoples’ rights in order to achieve their
goals</em>, not by completely subjugating them and turning them into
slaves. Metaphorically speaking, wealthy individuals are more likely to
drive over an anthill than to force the ants therein to come out and
sing praises to them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, anarchist law enforcement enables the metaphorical ants
to protect themselves from such tramplings.</p>
<h2
id="autocracy-used-to-be-a-means-to-the-end-of-acquiring-wealth-and-power">Autocracy
used to be a means to the end of acquiring wealth and power</h2>
<p>This then naturally begs the question: <em>If public governance is so
costly, then why do people engage in it?</em></p>
<p>The answer to this is that governance could be seen as a form of
business, one where you receive revenues from protection rackets, which
has <em>the potential</em> to bring in profits for you, but also entails
risks and operational costs. If you happen to already operate one, then
there’s little reason to relinquish this “business”’ monopoly privileges
through which you can unilaterally decree things and set the fees of
protection rackets; if you are relatively poor, say a mongol tribesman,
and your neighbor is disproportionately wealthier, then conquering them
and establishing a protection racket over said wealthier neighbors might
be worth the risk.</p>
<p>If however you have already “made it” in one business, jeopardizing
your wealth by trying to establish and manage a protection racket
business is likely going to cost too much in relation to the monetary
profits that could be derived from it, and the establishment of such a
protection racket will tie you up, preventing you from engaging in other
ventures with said time and resources that will mean more to you.</p>

<p>Just appeal to the sycophants that admire you over your success and
have such bootlickers be part of your court. Maybe finance a cult where
you are in the center or something, which notably we curiously don’t see
people do in spite of the fact that it would be the clearest way by
which they could establish proto-neo-feudalism and accrue the veneration
they supposedly crave.</p>
<p>Even when they buy islands or build bunkers, it’s for exclusivity and
insulation, not subjugation.</p>

<p>Of course, not all wealthy individuals are benevolent technophiles.
Some will engage in manipulative lobbying, collusion, or reputational
warfare. But these are abuses of process—not cases of direct domination.
And unlike conquest or coercive rule, they remain subject to exposure,
competition, and ostracism within an open system of law.</p>

<p>Wealthy individuals, sitting on immense amounts of wealth and power,
<em>limited by societal constraints regarding how they can dispose of
said means in aggressive</em> (in the sense of <em>initiatory</em>
coercion) <em>ways</em>, will naturally seek to channel said means in
peaceful ways conducive to build their legacy.</p>
<p>The misconception that either the rich or non-rich must dominate
misses the reality that many high-level actors don’t view society in
zero-sum terms at all. Their goals—personal legacy, innovation, or
prestige—are achieved not by ruling others, but by unlocking the
admiration, utility, and cooperation of others. In short: for the rich,
<em>respect</em> scales better than <em>submission</em>.</p>

<h1 id="why-anarchy-better-prevents-de-facto-corporatocracy">Why Anarchy
Better Prevents De Facto Corporatocracy</h1>
<h2 id="tyranny-not-corporatocracy-is-the-problem">Tyranny, not
corporatocracy, is the problem</h2>
<p>Pretty much everyone recognizes that the problem with corporatocracy
is <em>not</em> that it’s rule by shareholders, but that it will lead to
abusive governance where people are imagined to be instrumentalized as
means towards other ends as opposed to being treated as ends in of
themselves by the State authorities… <em>even though nothing in
corporatocracy inherently entails this since one could equally argue
that the shareholders will be careful in governance in order to keep
valuable assets and residents from moving from the territory over which
they rule</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tyranny, properly understood, is not defined by the identity
of the ruler—be it a monarch, politician, or corporate board—but by the
structural condition in which individuals are treated as mere
instruments for the objectives of those in power.</strong> It is the
experience of being managed, harvested, taxed, or mobilized for ends not
your own. This is the essence of tyrannical governance: when the ruling
structure regards the people not as autonomous agents to respect, but as
programmable variables to exploit. In contrast, non-tyrannical orders
are those in which individuals are treated as
<em>ends-in-themselves</em>—where their rights, consent, and choices
form the boundary of all legitimate authority.</p>
<p>This is why the fear of “corporate rule” misses the mark: what
matters is not whether a boardroom or a parliament issues the rules, but
whether those rules emerge from voluntary association, respect for
rights, and the ability to exit—core features that anarchist orders are
uniquely structured to protect.</p>

in a best-case scenario: a State by virtue of appointing the judges
tasked with keeping it in check biases them</h3>
<p><img src="8.webp" /><br />
<img src="9.webp" /><img src="10.webp" /><br />
A State by its very nature must be a territorial monopolist of
<strong>ultimate decision-making over a territory</strong>. If a State
lacks this final say status, then people subject to its decrees can
simply consult another authority to rule whether the decree is valid or
not, <em>which would in soon time merely turn said State into another
market actor in a market anarchy</em>.</p>
<p>The very glaring problem with this ultimate decision-making status
over a territory status is that the State becomes the law-maker, the
judge and the law enforcer, running everything within its jurisdiction
entirely according to its own centrally planned priorities.</p>
<p><strong>The perhaps most glaring problem with this ultimate
decision-making status is that the State is the employer of those judges
tasked with ensuring that it rules within its law code’s confines. It’s
a conflict of interest that wouldn’t be tolerated elsewhere.</strong>
Notwithstanding that Statist law codes usually produce avalanches of law
which many times contradict each other or which are vague which enable
judges to pretty much interpret whatever they want in politically
charged cases, the State being the employer of the judges tasked with
keeping it in check pretty much defangs the checks and balances.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the inherent contradiction in a system where
judges—who are supposed to constrain power—are hired, promoted, and
evaluated by the very institution they’re meant to limit.</strong>
Imagine being employed by an entity and tasked with deciding whether
your employer’s actions are legitimate. <em>Even with the best
intentions, you’re structurally incentivized to defer to your employer’s
priorities, or at the very least avoid conflict. Failure to do so may
not only harm your career, but disqualify you from ever being selected
in the first place.</em> This dynamic is clearest in systems like the
U.S. Supreme Court, where justices are nominated explicitly on the basis
of how their <strong>interpretive biases</strong> align with the
ideological goals of those in power.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“But their wages are fixed! They rule for life!”</strong>
Doesn’t really matter if they are selected for their desire to rule in
some way. If you appointed Adolf Hitler as a supreme court judge, it
wouldn’t matter that his wage is fixed (or that he is a lifetime
appointed which he rather would be very pleased to be) — he would just
rule as much as possible in line with his vision as possible. While of
course supreme court judges are not literally Adolf Hitlers, one should
think of their latent partisanhood as such: they are appointed by State
operatives, so of course they are going to be picked to facilitate their
aims.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>“But supreme courts rule against their employers
sometimes!”</strong> The interests of those managing a State are not
uniform. For example in the United States, supreme court judges are
nominated by the executive and then validated by the senate, making them
pass a basic impartiality filter. <em>The problem with this filter is
that it merely makes the supreme court judges have been filtered with
regards to deliberating concerning those who appointed and validated
their appointment.</em> By virtue of having been appointed only after
this filter, it’s true that they are not going to blindly rule in favor
of one party per se, <strong><em>but one can expect it to rule in line
with what aligns with both parties’ desires — i.e. in line with the
State apparatuses’ overall interests</em></strong>. Consequently,
whenever supreme courts rule against proposals by State operatives, this
should rather be seen as said <strong>supreme courts balancing
<em>intra</em>-State interests</strong>, i.e. of interests of those
wielding power within the State apparatus that appointed them. It
doesn’t make the judges impartial, <strong><em>it just makes them into
an arbitration agency between the different interests using State
power</em></strong>.
<ul>
<li>The way supreme courts are selected are like if two enemies select a
judge whose rulings a third party will have to respect if they come into
a dispute with one of the two enemies. Even if the two enemies don’t
agree on everything, in regards to third parties, they might have mutual
interests, such as appointing a judge that will rule favorably to them
both in case that they come into a dispute with that third party.
<strong>This is the same with the State machinery appointing judges:
while the operators of the State machinery don’t agree 100% with each
other, but may fiercely disagree, by virtue of being able to select the
judges they will by sheer self-interest be incentivized to select those
judges most favorably ruling for their desired ends; in case of
disagreement, they will compromise into one that benefits both, but this
will benefit the State by virtue of being selected by State operatives
whose incentives lie in trying to have the State wield its power as well
as possible for their desired ends.</strong> The compromise will be done
by state operatives both having the incentive to wield state power
towards their desired end, which naturally tends towards judicial drift
as people will want judges that rule favorably for <em>their</em>
specific agenda. To deny this is to think that being a State operative
for some reason transforms people into angels.
<ul>
<li>Alternative framing of this: State supreme courts is like if one’s
employer and his competitors unanimously selected judges that all of
their employees would have to go to in case of labor disputes. The
competitors disagree with each other and do wish for each other to be
out-competed out of the market, much like how State operatives would
ideally wish to see their competitors to how to wield State power to
cede their power to State operatives that align with them instead, but
with regards to disputes between them and their employees, they have
shared incentives in how to resolve disputes with their employees for
their respective mutual benefits, much like how State operatives wishing
to wield State power for the attainment of specific states of affairs
have with regards to the territory they reign over. The Statist would
agree that the employer-selected labor dispute judge would constitute a
dangerous conflict of interest, yet when it comes to State operatives,
they excuse the fact that the State operatives are the ones selecting
the judges that will judge them, such as when they come into a dispute
with a subject of theirs: a modern likely rationalization is that some
of the State operatives involved in this process will be elected by the
subjects, thereby supposedly forcing the equivalent of the employers in
the original analogy to be careful in the selection of the judge, at
pain of being voted out; it’s a rather comforting rationalization, but
which upon closer scrutiny falls apart given that even if judge
selections would cause the appointers and confirmers of such judges to
be voted out, said judges would still be positioned to do their
electors’ biddings, and the State operatives that appointed and
confirmed them remain in power until the next election. In reality, the
intricacies of judge selection is perceived as too overwhelming for the
average voter, making such concerns not be enough to cause such drastic
punitive changes in voter behavior — indeed, by the very nature of such
judge selections happening through <em>compromises</em> between State
operatives, those putting their faith in the respective compromising
parties will not see any reason to object to it since said State
operatives will not call for it after the deed.<br />
</li>
<li>Even if you don’t have United States-styled appointment and
verification of judges, but instead selection of judges by “impartial”
judicial agencies, these agencies will still be biased in favor of the
State because they obtain their revenues from the State; the agencies
will furthermore have been created by some people with political biases
and elevated to their authoritative positions by some political
operatives, meaning that the agencies will have an inertia of political
bias—if not political operatives are actively able to influence who is
included and able to wield judicial authority/select judges—causing
these superficially politically unaffected “independent” judicial bodies
selecting the supreme court judges to still have political bias.
<ul>
<li>In short: the supposedly “independent” judicial bodies need to have
been elevated to authoritative judicial bodies by the State at some
point to be able to appoint supreme court judges. Even granting no
active interference to politicize it or said agencies acting cautiously
in recognition that their livelihoods depend on the State machinery
continuing to provide them revenues, those elevating those specific
agencies to positions of authority will naturally select them to said
authority instead of others since that suits their desired ends. To
think otherwise is to be extremely naive and think of politicians as
selfless angels.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In any other context—say, a corporation appointing internal
“watchdogs” to determine whether its executives are breaking internal
rules—this would be immediately seen as farcical. Yet in the case of
government, we’re simply told to <strong>trust the institutional
design</strong>, as if a conflict of interest becomes virtuous when
cloaked in robes and rituals.</p>
<h3
id="with-statism-you-only-need-to-capture-one-entity-to-take-over-an-entire-society">With
Statism, you only need to capture one entity to take over an entire
society</h3>
<p>If you <em>theoretically</em> managed to usurp a country’s supreme
court and make them make rulings in favor of your agenda, then you would
be able to take over an entire society since law enforcement is
nominally made to enforce whatever is legislated and potential opinions
of judges, <em>where the supreme court is the one that could
theoretically unilaterally make judicial rulings to create the</em> de
facto <em>law code out of their legal rulings</em>. <strong>According to
Statists, supreme courts have the power to look over any country’s law
code and say “Actually, the spirit of the law is the non-aggression
principle; this country is henceforth a natural law jurisdiction” and
then for law enforcers to enforce said new <em>de facto law</em> code
from their interpretations.</strong> Supreme court judges are after all
appointed to wield the authority of having the final say of what the law
means.</p>
<p>Of course, in practice, <strong>the judiciary’s official powers are
constrained by the reality of power politics that prevents them from
fully exercising their role as supreme opinions on the law</strong>,
which begs the question why people without said authority should be able
to trump their legal opinions, and immediately showcases a supremacy of
the State over the judiciary that seriously weakens the judiciary’s
ability to keep the State in check. <em>Remark: while anarchy will have
certain judges whose legal opinions are the most authoritative given
specific matters, anarchy never claims that said most authoritative
judge’s opinions will always be the most authoritative as long as their
tenure remains, but sets it to market competition and embraces the fact
that if their rulings are flawed, then it will hurt their
authoritativeness, even if admittedly such a dynamic is more ambiguous
than a “supreme entity commands unquestioning subordinate
entities”.</em></p>
<p>If not the fact that the liberal democratic Weimar Republic
<strong>dismantled itself through entirely institutional means</strong>
is a worrying enough precedent, then the conduct of the so-called
“beacon of democracy” the United States during the presidency of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt with unprecedented and unimpeded heavy-handed
State interference made in stark contrast to the founding fathers’
intentions, where the internment of Japanese Americans being the most
worrying case of malleability of State law. <strong>In order to take
over a Statist territory, you only have to take over the State, and then
you will be able to exercise your power through its
monopolies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Statist legal theory is caught in a contradiction: if the
supreme court has true supremacy, then it becomes an unelected
legislature; if it doesn’t, then it is subordinated to political actors
and cannot restrain them. This is not a flaw of any particular
court—it’s a structural paradox of State-centric law itself. <em>An
anarchist order, by contrast, disperses legal interpretive power across
competitive actors, making no one immune to reputational or
institutional correction.</em></strong></p>
<p>This problem is excellently expressed by Hans-Hermann Hoppe:<br />
“Rather, the state unilaterally fixes the rules of the game and can
change them, per legislation, during the game. Obviously, such behavior
is inconceivable for freely financed security providers. Just imagine a
security provider, whether police, insurer, or arbitrator, whose offer
consisted in something like this:</p>
<p>‘I will not contractually guarantee you anything. I will not tell you
what specific things I will regard as your to-be-protected property, nor
will I tell you what I oblige myself to do if, according to your
opinion, I do not fulfill my service to you—but in any case, I reserve
the right to unilaterally determine the price that you must pay me for
such undefined service.’”</p>
<h4
id="how-an-anarchist-orders-distributed-legal-interpretative-power-decidedly-prevents-such-strategic-takeover-scenarios">How
an anarchist order’s distributed legal interpretative power decidedly
prevents such strategic takeover scenarios</h4>
<p>Anarchy makes no pretence of having a fixed monopolist supreme court
whose opinions all are expected slavishly followed; judges’
authoritativeness are directly correlated to the degree to which they
accurately rule in accordance to natural law and in accordance to their
ability to demonstrate a lack of partiality and negligence, and are
freely chosen by disputants to resolve conflicts for that, grotesque
divergences<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> from which are usually very easy to
detect.</p>
<p>Consequently, <strong>even if some ultra rich individuals tried to
buy up all of the judges in an anarchist territory</strong>, upon having
bought them―which one may remark will have probably cost them at least
more than 9/10ths of their fortunes given that judges who realize that
they are attempted to be bought up will realize that if they accept
those bribes, they will no longer be able to continue their legal
opining services to earn incomes given the blatant fact that said
bribing will make it clear that they have been compromised and no longer
rule faithfully to natural law, yet as long as they don’t accept those
bribes, they can earn incomes thanks to their authoritativeness, making
them able to basically extort the ultra rich person wishing to purchase
the entire territory’s judiciary―<strong>then people would just resort
to binding their conflict resolutions to <em>literally anyone other than
the currently compromised</em> previously <em>authoritative
judges</em></strong>, <em>soon raising another generation of credible
judges to replace the previously authoritative ones, likely continuing
on the precedent set by the previously authoritative judges during the
time that they weren’t compromised</em>.</p>
<p>This contrasts with Statist structures for which taking over a
supreme court would <em>theoretically</em> enable you as an
ultra-wealthy individual to then take over the entire State machinery.
You would just have to promise the supreme court actors great spoils
after that they have made their rulings conducive to your takeover
scenario and then, given that supreme courts are made to not be
restricted by non-supreme court actors, you would be able to unimpededly
take over the Statist territory. Of course again, in reality, the
supreme courts are ultimately subordinate to non-supreme court actors,
and when push comes to shove, their rulings on the law can be ignored
and/or be made biased for the non-supreme court actors’ gains, which
just reveals to which degree Statism is fundamentally is just rule by
decree and how any Statist territory is entirely at the mercy of those
powers able to override supreme courts’ rulings not deciding to go
tyrannical.</p>

democracies’ incentives to side with the big guy over the small guy</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalismSlander/comments/1hzq23z/representatives_will_always_first_and_foremost/%20">Notwithstanding
the fact that even so-called “democracies” (in reality States in which
the ruling oligarchy is selected via universal electoralism,
i.e. representative oligarchies), will always merely devolve into “rule
by interest groups through demagogues“</a>, States are inherently
incentivized to side with the powerful over the less powerful due to the
sheer fact that having the powerful on their side is more profitable for
them than the cost of screwing over some less powerful individual.</p>
<p>If you as a State operative are faced to judge a conflict between a
or a group of poor individual and a large corporation, then letting the
large corporation win the conflict will usually enable you to accrue
larger returns and power for different ends, whereas if you let the poor
person or group thereof be screwed over, they will usually still be
powerless to do anything about it; if you let the poor or group of poor
people win, you might see the big corporation choose to invest
elsewhere, invest less where you operate or move their operations
entirely, all of which are bad for you as the State operative.</p>
<p>Sure, egregious abuses by big corporations are likely to be
appropriately dealt with, either by court cases which cannot deny the
violations therein or by mass voter action, but if screwing over some
poor people will bring a majority benefits thanks to the big
corporation’s new goods and services… then people are likely to turn a
blind eye to such abuses.</p>
<p>It’s also worthwhile remarking that having the State seize big
corporations’ assets and having them be managed in the name of “the
people” still leads to the same conundrum, as the experience of marxist
States has demonstrated for us. If a coal factory is built in your
vicinity that pollutes your property with unprecedented degrees of
pollution, then it doesn’t matter whether it’s by a private corporation
or a State-run one: <strong><em>the problem is that your rights are
thereby being violated</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="anarchist-law-enforcement-lacks-this-conundrum">Anarchist law
enforcement lacks this conundrum</h3>
<p>Even presuming that clients of DIAs would be completely passive with
regards to evaluating the desirability of their current security
provision, rival DIAs would be ones with vested direct incentives to
expose rival DIAs’ inabilities to defend their clients, and seek to
inject every failure of theirs to adequately defend one of their clients
into the public consciousness as to drive customers away from said
fraudulent rival DIA to their own.</p>
<ul>
<li>In case of <strong>inter-agency disputes</strong>, a DIA will have
to stand up for their relatively less powerful clients in case of
disputes with relatively more powerful clients at pain of breach of
contract and mass unsubscribals by clients upon learning about that
failure to protect a client’s rights adequately only due to the prospect
of power imbalances.<br />
</li>
<li>In case of <strong>intra-agency disputes</strong>, the same logic
pretty much applies, where if a DIA is ruling favorably for wealthier
clients in intra-agency disputes, then said DIA will not enjoy the
profitability coming from mass subscriptions by relatively less powerful
individuals, which as one can see in the example in <em>Through
relatively small regular subscriptions, you can access larger resource
pools, and thus impressive security</em>, will constitute a lot of
money.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s true that losing a wealthy client might deprive your DIA from
great revenues, <strong>but because the other clients enjoy much greater
ease-of-exit from your specific security provision services, then they
will easily be able to stop providing revenues to you in case that they
perceive of you as favoring the wealthier clients over less wealthy
clients</strong>, thereby jeopardizing the protection of their rights
they subscribed for you in the first place, in case of disputes.
<strong>This stands in stark contrast to Statist systems where the exit
costs are much greater, necessitating physical displacements, usually to
foreign cultures. In anarchy, changing a security provider is merely a
question of changing subscription.</strong></p>
