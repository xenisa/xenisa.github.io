<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>
<p>In the previous lesson we discovered some necessary facts about the
nature of law; we know that there must be a universal and objective law,
and we know that the normative structure of law must be based upon the
normative structure of argumentation. In this lesson the central
norm–the core axiom of true law–will be made explicit.</p>
<p>We call this central axiom the Non-Aggression Principle, or NAP, and
it can be stated as follows: the non-aggressor ought be the director, or
that the aggressor ought not be the director (these statements are
contra-positive). Let’s break that down, here aggression is defined as
the initiation of conflict, so in any contest over some property <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is the aggressor and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> the non-aggressor, <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> ought be the one to direct the use
of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> ought not.</p>
<h1 id="the-argument-from-argument">The Argument from Argument</h1>
<p>The term ’axiom’ has a precise meaning in philosophy, unlike in
mathematics where axioms are merely inter-consistent but arbitrarily
chosen
rules,<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
praxeological axioms are self-evident propositions. A proposition is
self-evident if you must accept its validity in attempting to dispute
its validity. We saw above how the law of non-contradiction is a
self-evident proposition, in disputing anything at all you first must
accept that the law of non-contradiction holds.</p>
<p>Similarly, in disputing the NAP you pre-suppose its truth as it is
implied by the very nature of argumentation. First, recall that
argumentation does not exist in a normative void, that is to say there
are certain norms which are pre-supposed in the very act of arguing.
Consider what it would mean for this not to be the case: if
argumentation had no particular normative structure it would lose any
meaning—literally any action a man takes could be considered an
argumentation: such as eating an apple, or swinging from tree, or
shooting someone through the head. It is because of the fact that
certain norms <em>define</em> a dialectic as such that there is such a
thing called argumentation in the first place.</p>
<p>Second, the validity of any truth claim must be raised and decided
upon in the course of an argumentation, so the normative structure of
argumentation in particular has the special status of being the
practical pre-condition for ascertaining the truth or validity of any
statement. This is known as the a priori of argumentation, which is
another self-evident proposition—if you were to dispute it, you would
first have to start arguing thus pre-supposing its truth.</p>
<p>Third, to try and argumentatively dispute one of the norms of
argumentation would be to contradict oneself, this is called a dialectic
or performative contradiction. That is, it is a contradiction not
between propositions, but between a proposition and the very act of
proposing it. For instance, if one were to argue that people ought never
argue they would first pre-suppose that they should be arguing, thus
they are in contradiction. Therefore, the negation of “people ought
never argue,” which is “people ought ever argue,” or “people ought
sometimes argue,” must be correct. Of note is that under argumentation
ethics the “sometimes” is not an arbitrary “when I feel like it,” it’s
something more like, “people should argue to resolve disputes” rather
than “people should engage in conflict to resolve disputes.”</p>
<p>This is because, fourth, argumentation is a conflict-free
interaction, interlocutors have some dispute over the truth of the
matter and they are seeking to convince the other not through the force
of violence (i.e. by aggressing against them), but rather through the
force of their argument. Specifically, argumentation is a method of
resolving disputes peacefully, not violently. Consider <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> have a dispute over who has the
property right to <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> asserts that they are the owner,
and vice versa. Arguing over this dispute would not involve the two
parties violently attacking each other, it would involve the exchange of
propositions with the intent of determining the truth of the matter.
Simply warring over <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> would
not be truth-seeking, interpersonal warfare does not involve
argumentative justification and argumentative justification does not
involve interpersonal warfare. This means that the normative structure
of argumentation implies non-aggression, thus the NAP is dialectically
true.</p>
<p>Consider what it would mean to say that this is not the case, that
violence is perfectly permissible in an argument. If Crusoe has a
disagreement with Friday and Crusoe decides that he will beat Friday
until agreement is reached is Crusoe really seeking the truth of the
matter here? Clearly he is not, coercing others to not argue with you
cannot tend to establish the truth—warfare of this sort is the enemy of
reason. Insofar as a man is engaged in unreason, i.e. avoiding truth, he
cannot coherently make any truth claim, thus no negation of any
proposition can arise from unreason—you have to accept reason to argue
at all and accepting reason means accepting the NAP. It certainly cannot
be denied that the purpose of argumentation is to seek the truth of the
matter, so such aggressive activities that do not tend to establish
truth must be excluded from arguments. In short argumentation is a
rational activity, and aggression is the enemy of reason, thus these
sets of actions must be mutually exclusive. All true propositions are
justifiable argumentatively. A true ethic is justifiable to an arguer.
Justifiability is irrelevant in a conflict. A conflict cannot be
justified to an arguer (if it could, there would be no conflict!).
Hence, causing conflicts is against the ethics of
argumentation.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looked at from another angle, participants in argumentation
indisputably need to use and control the scarce resources in the world
to survive; otherwise, they would perish. But because their scarcity
makes conflict over the uses of resources possible, only norms that
determine the proper ownership can avoid conflict over these scarce
goods. That such norms are valuable cannot be denied, because anyone who
is alive in the world and participating in the practical activity of
argumentation cannot deny the value of being able to control scarce
resources and the value of avoiding conflicts over such scarce
resources.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-contradiction-of-rights-scepticism">The Contradiction of
Rights-Scepticism</h1>
<p>A further proof of the existence of rights is found by considering
what it would mean to deny that rights exist. Kinsella introduces the
concept as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any right at all exists, it is a right of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to have or do <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> without <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>’s preventing it; and, therefore,
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> can legitimately use force
against <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> to <em>enforce</em>
the right. <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is concerned with
the enforceability of his right to <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>, and this enforceability is all
that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> requires in order to be
secure in his right to <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>. For
a rights-skeptic meaningfully to challenge <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s asserted right, the skeptic must
challenge the <em>enforceability</em> of the right, instead of merely
challenging the existence of the right. Nothing less will do. If the
skeptic does not deny that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s
proposed enforcement of his purported right is legitimate, then the
skeptic has not denied <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s
right to <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>, because what it
<em>means</em> to have a right is to be able to legitimately enforce it.
If the skeptic maintains, then, that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> has no right to <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>, indeed, no rights at all since
there are no rights, the skeptic must also maintain that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s enforcement of his purported
right to <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is not
justified.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presents a problem for the rights-sceptic, however, because he
must hold that enforcement–i.e. the use of force–<em>requires</em>
justification. But <em>merely</em> challenging <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s use of force is not enough, the
rights-sceptic can’t just express distaste at the enforcement he must
attack the legitimacy of said use of force. But in order to challenge
the legitimacy of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> using
force against <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> to enforce the
right, he must hold that <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has
a right to not have this force used against him—i.e. that <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> or someone else can legitimately
use force to <em>stop</em> <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s
use of force. But then he is in contradiction, because he must recognise
a right held by <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> in his
denial that rights exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More common-sensically, this demonstration points out the
inconsistency on the part of a rights-skeptic who engages in discourse
about the propriety of rights at all. If there are no rights, then there
is no such thing as the justifiable or legitimate use of force, but
neither is there such a thing as the unjust use of force. But if there
is no unjust use of force, what is it, exactly, that a rights-skeptic is
concerned about? If individuals delude themselves into thinking that
they have natural rights, and, acting on this assumption, go about
enforcing these rights as if they are true, the skeptic has no grounds
to complain. To the extent the skeptic complains about people enforcing
these illusory rights, he begins to attribute rights to those having
force used against them. Any rights-skeptic can only shut
up,<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
because he contradicts himself the moment he objects to others’ acting
as if they have rights.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Indeed, another way to respond to a rights-skeptic would be to
propose to physically harm him. If there are no rights, as he maintains,
then he cannot object to being harmed. So, presumably, any
rights-skeptic would change his position and admit there were rights (if
only so as to be able to object to being harmed)—or there would soon be
no more rights-skeptics left alive to give rights-advocates any
trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="indirect-and-joint-aggression">Indirect and Joint
Aggression</h1>
<p>A somewhat common question raised with respect to the Non-Aggression
Principle is whether the mob boss who merely orders his goons to engage
in some aggression is himself an aggressor. The answer to this question
is yes, both he and his goons are engaged in the aggression in question.
To highlight why this is the case consider that a crime is an action—it
is the use of efficacious means to cause the invasion of the borders of
other peoples’ property, because such an invasion initiates conflict
between the criminal and the victim. What is important here is that you
can use other people as a means towards some end. In the provided
example the mob boss is using his goons as a means to cause the invasion
of the victims property, and the goons are using their hands or some
weapons as means to the same end—both the boss and his goons are engaged
in the same aggressive invasion.</p>
<p>Consider the example of a man shipping a bomb to a victims house
using a courier, the bomb blows up upon the victim opening the package,
has the bomb-maker committed a crime here? Well, if using other people
as means is to break the chain of causation then perhaps the courier is
the criminal as he is the one who delivered the bomb. But even this
cannot be so, because the bomb only went off upon the victim opening the
package, so really the victim has committed suicide! Of course, this is
ridiculous, the bomb-maker is well-aware that paying a courier to
deliver a package to someone is likely to result in said package being
opened—the courier and the victim are both being used as means towards
the end of the victim exploding, this is the intent of the
bomb-maker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the [positive] law recognizes that an intervening force only
breaks the chain causal connection when it is unforeseeable. As the
Restatement of Torts provides, “The intervention of a force which is a
normal consequence of a situation created by the actor’s … conduct is
not a superseding cause of harm which such conduct has been a
substantial factor in bringing about” […] Clearly, when the terrorist in
these cases uses a courier to deliver a letter bomb, it is not
unforeseeable that the victim will receive it; and it is not
unforeseeable that the victim will open
it.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because if the outcome of a given activity was truly
unforeseeable this implies that it is not an action, as for it to be an
action the end has to be deliberately aimed at and sought after.
Consider me leaving a knife on my kitchen counter that is then whipped
away by a tornado and thus stabs a man through the heart. I didn’t stab
him, the tornado did, because the tornado was unforeseeable by me. If I
was a wizard who could control tornadoes and I summoned the tornado to
throw my knife into the heart of the man that would be foreseeable and
therefore criminal. In other words, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> simply hoping that lightning will
strike <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is different to <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> knowing exactly when and where
lightning will strike and duping <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> into standing there at the
appropriate time—“there is no intention if the outcome is only hoped
for.”<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup></p>
<p>To make this even more clear consider the example of a rifle that
requires three men to shoot—perhaps it has three triggers which are far
apart and which all must be pulled to fire the bullet. If three men
conspire to each pull a trigger at the same time to shoot an innocent
man, then all three of them are engaged in an aggression against this
person. We can trivially analogise this to a bomber plane that requires
three men to operate—one to steer the plane, one to load the bombs, and
a third to trigger the release of the bombs. It is not only the man who
triggers the release, but also his two co-conspirators who are each
engaged in the action of bombing with the bomber plane—insofar as this
bombing is an aggression then all three men are equally liable for this
crime.</p>
<p>This is why the getaway driver in a bank robbery is just as liable
for the theft as his partners who restrained the crowd and stole the
funds from the vault respectively. Furthermore, if in the process of the
robbery the crowd-controller shoots one of the hostages the getaway
driver and the safecracker are responsible for this murder because the
murder is understood to be a part of the entire robbery going forth. If
instead they were not robbing a bank, which involves threatening
hostages with death, but were rather jointly attempting to steal a car
then one of the car thieves randomly sets off a bomb killing countless
individuals, then only the bomber is responsible. Setting off the bomb
is a separate action to the stealing of the cars, so the co-conspirators
to the car theft are not responsible for it.</p>
<p>To re-iterate this point allow me to quote
Kinsella:<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the following example. A malcontent, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, purchases a remote-controlled
tank. With the remote control he can steer the tank and fire its cannon.
He directs the tank to blow down the walls of a neighbor’s house,
destroying the house and killing the neighbor. No one would deny that
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is the cause of the killing
and is guilty of murder and trespass. However, after the rampage, a
hatch opens in the tank, and an evil midget jumps out. It turns out, you
see, that the midget could see on a screen which buttons were pressed on
the remote control, and he would operate the tank accordingly. We submit
that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is equally liable in
both cases. From his point of view, the tank was a “black box” that he
used to attain his end, regardless of whether there was a human will
somewhere in the chain of causation. (Of course, the evil midget is also
liable.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “black box” thinking is crucial; consider what would happen if
it was discovered some day that firearms are actually sentient and are
capable of choosing not to accept a trigger press and that this is the
cause of bullet jams. Would this suddenly absolve everyone who has used
a firearm to kill another of any criminal responsibility? Surely not,
none of these people knew that firearms were sentient and could refuse
to shoot, to the gunmen the firearm is a means towards the end of
shooting a bullet at their victim(s), this does not change if it is
later discovered that firearms have a mind of their own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is illegal to hit someone […] this means that it is illegal to
<em>cause</em> another person to be hit; that is to say, it is illegal
to use physical objects, including one’s fist, in a way that will cause
the unwanted physical contact with another person.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In analyzing action through the lens of the praxeological means-ends
structure to determine if it amounts to aggression, we ask if the actor
employed <em>means</em> to achieve the end of invading the borders of
another’s property or body—in other words, we ask if he <em>caused</em>
the border invasion. The means employed can be inanimate or nonhuman
means governed solely by causal laws (a gun), or it can include other
humans who are employed as means to achieve the illicit end desired. The
latter category includes both innocent humans that one employs to cause
a border invasion and culpable humans that one conspires (cooperates)
with to achieve the illicit
end.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup></p>

<p>We can use this analysis to highlight also the guilt of Henry II of
England, who reportedly exclaimed “will no one rid me of this turbulent
priest” to a group of knights under his employ. The “turbulent priest”
referred to the Archbishop of Canterbury who had excommunicated a number
of bishops supportive of the king. Four of the kings knights upon
hearing the kings utterance went to the archbishop and murdered him. The
argument is that the kings words, though not literally worded as an
order, nevertheless communicated to his knights that he wished for them
to carry out the ridding of the priest. What this highlights is the
importance of communication in libertarian theory—the king is using his
knights as a means because he is communicating to them his desire for
them to kill or otherwise coerce the priest.</p>
<p>What this shows is that social norms and understanding of language
can influence whether a given set of words demonstrate an aggression or
not. So it may be the case that if I am in a seedy bar and I go up to
the biggest, toughest guy in there and call his mother a whore I am in
fact communicating to him that I want a fight. Or another case is when I
have a mailbox on my front door and a path leading to it, this can be
seen as communicating to couriers that I want them to deliver packages
by walking up to my door over my path and placing packages inside the
mailbox. This demonstrates the limits of what Kinsella dubs “armchair
theorising,”<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>
one cannot say with certainty whether a given action is aggression
without having all of the relevant information provided, which is why
judges are necessary in a rational legal system—the judge is able to
analyse all of the relevant details to determine who is at fault. The
job of the jurist sitting in his armchair is to explicate objective
principles and perhaps to apply them to various simple hypothetical
scenarios, where all relevant details can be provided.</p>
