<p>If ethics is a normative discipline that identifies and classifies
certain sets of actions as good or evil, right or wrong, then tort or
criminal law is a subset of ethics identifying certain actions as
appropriate for using violence against them. The law says that action
<span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> should be illegal, and
therefore <em>should</em> be combated by the violence of the law. The
law is a set of “ought” or normative propositions.</p>

<h1 id="law-as-a-subset-of-ethics">Law as a Subset of Ethics</h1>
<p>To proceed with an explication of Austrian legal theory, we must
understand what the nature of law is. First, law is a normative
standard, that is to say that law is evaluative—legal theory identifies
a group of criminals and a group of non-criminals with reference to a
norm. However, there are normative questions that law does not
cover–such as the question of where to plant ones crops, or by what
standard should art be judged–that is to say, there may be certain
norms, certain guides to action, which are not covered by law, so law
cannot be <em>exhaustive</em> of evaluative philosophy.</p>
<p>Second, we know that law deals with <em>justice</em>, that is to say,
law prohibits that which is unjust, and permits that which is just. What
is meant by saying that <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is
just, is that <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> can be
argumentatively justified. So law is a normative standard which guides
men to just over unjust actions.</p>
<p>Third, argumentative justification is a human action, requiring the
use of scarce means—lets unpack that. Action is defined as purposeful
behaviour, it is the implementation of some scarce means towards some
end—consider the example of John eating a ham sandwich to satiate his
hunger. His end is the removal of the hunger, and his means to achieve
this end is the ham sandwich. Of note here is that the means a man
employs is necessarily scarce, which means that his use of it prevents
others from being able to use it. Therefore in argumentatively
justifying anything a man has to concern himself with scarcity.</p>
<p>Fourth, because of scarcity there is a possibility for conflicts.
Conflicts are defined as contradictory actions, so if Crusoe and Friday
are on an island and Crusoe is trying to use a stick to spearfish at the
same time that Friday is trying to use it to stoke his fire we have a
conflict. The stick is scarce, so its use by one man prevents the other
man from using it, so only one action–spear fishing or the stoking of
the fire–is able to take place, that is to say that one action excludes
the other.</p>
<p>Fifth, because the possibility for conflict exists and cannot be
ignored in argumentative justification, any legal theory must assign
exclusive property rights so as to determine the just winner in a given
conflict. That is to say, law identifies which set of people are engaged
in just direction (non-criminals) and which set are engaged in unjust
direction (criminals). In other words, law couldn’t assign that a given
direction of some means is both just and unjust. Here a property right
in <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> held by <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> means that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is the one who has the right to
direct the use of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>.</p>
<p>Sixth, a position on the just winner in a conflict, which is to say a
position on law, is a position on ethics. Ethics is the area of
philosophy which deals in general with guides to mans action—i.e. what
man ought do. Specifically, law is a subset of ethics which deals with
who should have possession of what, or more specifically who should be
the one directing the possession of what, we can therefore define law as
ethics applied to the issue of conflicts. This is specifically a subset
of inter-personal ethics, contrasted with autistic ethics which deals
with how the man alone should act. So ethics is made of autistic and
inter-personal ethics, and law is a subset of the latter dealing not in
general with how men should interact, but with the subset of
interactions that are defined as conflicts. Consider what it would mean
to say that law is not in fact a subset of ethics — <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> claims that he cannot justify his
direction of the use of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, but
also that he should nevertheless be its director. What is meant by <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> claiming that he should direct
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>? This claim by <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is an attempt to justify <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>’s direction, which <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> claims that he cannot do,
therefore <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is in
contradiction, we shall see shortly that contradictions are falsehoods,
therefore meaning that it cannot be the case that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> should be the director where said
direction is unjust. So, law must be a subset of ethics—there does not
exist any legal claim which is not also a moral claim.</p>
<h1 id="objective-law-and-its-critics">Objective Law and its
Critics</h1>
<h2 id="the-failure-of-legal-polylogism">The Failure of Legal
Polylogism</h2>
<p>As we have seen, law is strictly derivable from the nature of
argumentation as a human action, employing scarce physical means,
therefore to assert that there are multiple different legal codes is to
assert that there are multiple different logics, which is called
polylogism. Legal-polylogism, then, is the claim that different men may
be able to adopt different logics in their argumentative justification
of a system of property rights.</p>
<p>The general problem with legal-polylogism is that it implies
contradiction, because for there to be different legal codes, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em>, ⋯, <em>Z</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> must be incompatible with every
other legal code, <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em>, ⋯, <em>Z</em></span>, in at least one
aspect, or else they would not be different, but the same, and we would
be back to singular law. Imagine that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> are incompatible on an action
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> claims it to be just and <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> claims it to be unjust. The
legal-polylogist asserts that both <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> <em>and</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> are correct, that <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> can both be justified and it
cannot be justified—a contradiction. The problem with that is that
contradictions are false, which we can see from the nature of
argumentation. Imagine Sally and Eric are in an argument over the truth
of the proposition <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>. Eric
claims that <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is the case, and
Sally claims that <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is not the
case—meaning that Eric asserts <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> and Sally asserts <span
class="math inline">¬<em>p</em></span>. For Sallys case to be considered
an attempted refutation of Eric, rather than simply speaking gibberish
or telling a joke, she must pre-suppose that <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> and <span
class="math inline">¬<em>p</em></span> cannot both be correct—that is to
say, in disputing anything, you pre-suppose the law of
non-contradiction, <span
class="math inline">¬(<em>p</em> ∧ ¬<em>p</em>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-failure-of-legal-positivism">The Failure of Legal
Positivism</h2>
<p>The Stanford Encyclopædia of Philosophy defines legal positivism as
the thesis that the existence and content of law depends on social facts
and not its
merits.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
In other words, a legal positivist claims that law is not a subset of
ethics, and thus there could potentially be such a thing as a virtuous
crime to a legal positivist. The article elaborates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The positivist thesis does not say that law’s merits are
unintelligible, unimportant, or peripheral to the philosophy of law. It
says that they do not determine whether laws or legal systems
<em>exist</em>. Whether a society has a legal system depends on the
presence of certain structures of governance, not on the extent to which
it satisfies ideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law. What laws
are in force in that system depends on what social standards its
officials recognize as authoritative; for example, legislative
enactments, judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a
policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient
reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is
unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for
doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been
posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Law to the legal positivist, then, is a description of the specific
arrangement of possessions that actually obtain, rather than a theory
describing the just arrangement of possessions. Let’s break that down,
the legal positivist is making the claim that law has nothing to do with
justice, rather, the law is determined by raw might, that is if <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is able to physically defeat <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> in a conflict and thus perform an
action <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, the positivist goes
only as far to point and say, “look, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> won the conflict, therefore the
law on this conflict is that <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>
won.” But, this is a complete non-theory; ok, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> won, so what? How on Earth they
think they get to cordon off an area of philosophy and take the label
“law” for what can be summed up in the sentence, “whoever wins a given
conflict has won that conflict,” is beyond me. The legal positivist as
such can’t even elucidate a theory predicting when people will choose to
engage in conflict and who is likely to win—those would be the domains
of economics and military theory respectively.</p>
<p>The problems with the positivist thesis do not stop here, even if a
positivist were to reject the separation of law and justice, claiming
that might makes right, their theory is still in ruin. Because the might
makes right theory of law is a form of legal polylogism—it is the claim
that the logic of which actions are justifiable can change depending on
whether you are able to successfully carry out that action and muscle
away anybody who gets in the way. As we saw above, legal polylogism in
general is false, therefore this form of legal positivism is false
also.</p>
<p>Any notion of a “source of rights” is indicative of positivism and
more fundamentally of the fallacy of primacy of consciousness. Rights
simply are, they don’t come from some consciousness whether divine or
social or individual. It is not arbitrary thoughts or decrees that are
the source of rights, but the logic of justification and conflict.</p>
<h2 id="objective-law-as-a-science-of-human-action">Objective Law as a
Science of Human Action</h2>
<p>So we have seen that the nature of law implies that there must be
universal law—that is, any form of legal polylogism is necessarily
false, and further to argue or dispute anything would pre-suppose the
existence of a single, universal law. We can say that this universal law
is therefore <em>true</em> law, as it is the normative foundation of
argumentation, and argumentation is a practical pre-condition for
ascertaining the truth or validity of anything. Imagine attempting to
dispute that this law is true, first you would have to accept its
validity as that validity is implied by the act of argumentation, so you
would therefore be explicitly proclaiming it to be false whilst
implicitly pre-supposing it to be true, which is a contradiction. A
contradiction, not between propositions, but between a proposition and
the very act of proposing it. But there is no such thing as a
free-floating proposition which does not come from an actor proposing
it, therefore there is an objective, natural law.</p>
<p>It is this natural law which shall be elucidated in this course, we
understand that its nature is that it is specifically a study of human
action, the general science of human action is called praxeology, so law
is a sub-science of praxeology. Thus it will be of use to briefly go
over some basic praxeology here to make comprehension of the rest of the
course easier. First, human action is purposeful behaviour, it is
distinct from mere behaviour in that the former involves some
intentional aiming at a goal, where the latter does not. So the
operation of a mans digestive system or the beating of his heart can be
understood as mere mechanistic behaviour as the man does not intend to
digest or to beat his heart, and on the other hand his choosing to eat
food or shock himself with a defibrillator are purposeful, so these are
not mere behaviours but are rather actions.</p>
<p>It is this notion of choice which is crucial to understanding
something as an action—action involves a deliberate attempt to change
the world to one that man finds preferable to the alternative where he
does not engage in said action. It is this choice of what man prefers
over the alternative that is the characteristic mark of an action.
Therefore for action to be possible in the first place, (1) a man must
experience some state of uneasiness, something that he doesn’t like, (2)
an imagined state of the world without this uneasiness and (3) the
belief that a given action will work to achieve this imagined state
without the uneasiness.</p>
<p>When a man acts the result he wishes to achieve can be called his
end, man always acts to remove uneasiness and the end is the imagined
state without said uneasiness. For man to achieve the end desired he
must employ certain means, metaphysical entities are understood as a
means when a human plans to employ or is employing it for the attainment
of some end. As has been shown, for a man to engage in an action <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> as opposed to <span
class="math inline">¬<em>X</em></span> implies that the man prefers to
engage in <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> as opposed to
<span class="math inline">¬<em>X</em></span>. What this preference means
is that the man thinks that he should do <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> rather than the alternative for
whatever reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of legal analysis, one important praxeological
doctrine is the distinction between action and mere behavior. The
difference between action and behavior boils down to intent. Action is
an individual’s intentional intervention in the physical world, via
certain selected means, with the purpose of attaining a state of affairs
that is preferable to the conditions that would prevail in the absence
of the action. Mere behavior, by contrast, is a person’s physical
movements that are not undertaken intentionally and that do not manifest
any purpose, plan, or
design.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="legislation-vs-discovery">Legislation vs Discovery</h1>
<p>In learning philosophy it is often of great use to the student to
study the history of philosophy such that an understanding of what ideas
have been had and where they came from can be attained. Thus a brief
overview of the history of (legal) philosophy seems appropriate to
include here. Kinsella provides such a brief
overview:<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In modern times the two dominant legal systems are the common law and
the civil law. Based on the body of English case law that developed
gradually over the centuries, the common law spread to English colonies
and commonwealths like America, Canada, and Australia. Modern civil law
systems are based on Roman law, which, like the common law, developed
many of its important legal principles in the accumulated decisions of
jurists in thousands of cases. Virtually all of Europe and many other
jurisdictions, including Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Quebec, have a
civil-law system.</p>
<p>In the common law and Roman law, there eventually evolved very
sophisticated bodies of legal principles, concepts, methodology, and
precedents. Because the classical common law and Roman law developed the
large bulk of their legal principles through the decision and discussion
of cases, they serve as rough examples of decentralized systems of
“judge-found” law, as do largely private customary law systems like the
Law Merchant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So broadly speaking there are two types of legal systems; (1) those
based upon “judge-found” law, and (2) those where the legal principles
are decreed by legislation. Roman law and English common-law are
examples of the former, where the legal principles are obtained by
judges attempting to do justice in a number of individual cases, which
is why such systems are described as case-law systems. Modern civil law,
on the other hand, is the prime example of a legislated system, where
principles are embodied in a “Civil Code,” derived from the arbitrary
decree of the legislative branch. Under a legislative system the judges
are not attempting to do justice in some particular dispute, rather they
make reference to the legislative fiat on this matter, so appealing to a
judge that a given law is unjust is not going to work where it would
work in a case-law system.</p>
<p>The distinction between “judge-found” law and law as decreed by
legislative fiat is an important one—in a de-centralised case-law system
the judges are at least setting out to do justice. This is in stark
distinction to a fiat-law system, where the so-called “laws” are not
rational but are rather arbitrary commandments issued top-down by the
legislature. Because these commandments are arbitrary there is nothing
objective about the laws in such a system, and because the laws are
non-objective but rather based on arbitrary–subjective–whim, such a
system is per se incompatible with justice and freedom, “even statutes
that seem to embody libertarian principles simultaneously subvert those
principles.”<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
Because in such a legislative system a victim of objective crime cannot
appeal to the objective principles of justice, judges can only
accidentally make the right call, and they have no way of determining
the correct compensation for the victim. In fact, most often
compensating the victim is completely ignored, instead the state will
charge the victim money in the form of taxes to punish the criminal by
some one-size-fits-all punishment scheme, usually imprisonment.</p>
<p>Bruno Leoni has pointed out further, that fiat law systems will tend
towards more legal
uncertainty.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
This is because where law is determined by arbitrary fiat, rather than
objective principles of justice, it can change at any moment—this has
the effect of making it challenging to even begin to follow the law in
the first place. Consider the many thousands of pages of legislation
that are committed to the
books,<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>
professional lawyers whose job it is to know the law could not hope to
keep up with this, let alone random citizens. There is also no means of
preventing contradictions from occurring between statutes, potentially
making it literally impossible to follow the law even if you know about
every word of it. This is not so with a found-law system, where there
has to be coherence between different objective principles.</p>
<p>So to sum up; the job of the rational jurist is to
explicate–discover–objective standards of law, the role of the judge is
to attempt to apply this objective body of law in a given case—the
rational judge attempts to <em>do justice</em> rather than apply or
create (posit) arbitrary rules based on whim. This is an important
insight, those in the David Friedman camp, called polycentrists, view an
anarcho-capitalist legal order as one of
multi-legislation–multi-centralised law–rather than de-centralised
judge-found law. The free-market judge is not a mini-legislature coming
up with arbitrary decrees, he is and must be attempting to apply
objective legal principles. We can–from the armchair–explicate such an
objective body of law, what we cannot do is actually elaborate every
possible case that might come up—this is the role of the judge, to
attempt to apply abstract and objective principles to concrete
cases.</p>
